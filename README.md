# Live-Blog-Analysis
<br />


I am using an API from WebHose.io to download 100 blogs. To perform data analysis, I have trained the pre-downloaded historical blogs on TF-IDF (Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency) and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) Algorithms to classify and cluster the blogs into groups based on its text (blog content). These algorithms have further been tested on live blogs scrapped by the WebHose API. <br />
Please see the README.md file in final folder to know more. <br />
Thank you.
