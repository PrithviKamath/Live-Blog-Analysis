During his appointment \u2014 which lasted for a single day \u2014 he had the power to issue one executive order, and as you might have guessed it, he reduced Careem fares for Lahore and Karachi. \nFare Reductions: 25% in Lahore on Go Rides 20% in Karachi for Go Rides \nThe former Pakistani cricketer and left-arm fast bowler Wasim Akram was announced as Careem\u2019s new honorary CEO. Post retirement, much like many former cricketers, Akram became a prominent commentator. He then took up the role of coach of Indian Premier League (IPL) side Kolkata Knight Riders and has helped them to be crowned champions in 2012 and 2014. \nIn view of this change, MD Careem, Junaid Iqbal stated: \nI am excited to announce Wasim Akram as our Honorary CEO of Careem Pakistan. He is the perfect cultural fit for Careem. And there is no one more qualified than the Sultan of Swing, Wasim Akram to head Careem Pakistan. I am proud to pass the torch to him and I have full confidence that he will bring out the best in our employees, Captains and Customers. \nAfter being instated as the CEO, Wasim Akram asked both Captains and customers to share one change they would like him to make to Careem given his new authority. \nSince the announcement, Wasim has looked over comments, experiences and reviews and as a result has decided to complement this change in Careem\u2019s structure with a change in prices. \nAs honorary CEO, Wasim Akram has made an executive order to cut prices in Lahore and Karachi. This price cut is only for GO cars where 25% price cut has been applied in Lahore and 20% in Karachi. The drop in prices is significant as fares in Lahore (for instance) can go as low as PKR 100. \nCareem said that it aims to provide a reliable, safe, convenient, and affordable means of transport for everyone every day. This time it has provided its customers a price cut that will certainly make traveling less burdensome. Primary Sidebar"}]
