However, it\u2019s the marketers that recognize the value of such data and use it to perfect the customer experience. Consumers, on the other hand, are often oblivious to their contribution to the mass data that marketers and businesses use to design their products and services. They don\u2019t realize that their phones actually ping location-based data to nearby retailers.
