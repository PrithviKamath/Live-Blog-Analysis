(HARLEY DAVIDSON/SPECIAL TO THE REVIEW/POSTMEDIA NETWORK) Change text size for the story Print \nReport an error \nHome prices in the Niagara region saw double-digit growth in the first quarter of 2017, according to a house price survey released Tuesday by Royal LePage. The survey found the aggregate price of a home in the region rose by 15.7 per cent year-over-year to $326,545. When broken out by housing type, the median price of a two-storey home and bungalow climbed 14.4 per cent and 17.5 per cent year-over-year to $344,929 and $304,739, respectively.\u201cProspective homeowners increasingly flocked to Niagara and St. Catharines during the first quarter, placing significant upward pressure on house prices within the region,\u201d said Brad Johnstone, broker of record for Royal LePage\u2019s Niagara real estate centre.\u201cThe region\u2019s affordability and high quality of life has attracted a great deal of attention from young families and first-time buyers in particular, who have been priced out of many other markets across southern Ontario.\u201d He said Niagara has been growing for the last 10 years, but not to this extent.\u201cObviously we\u2019ve got lots of exposure and we\u2019re closing that gap on other markets, sort of that one-hour drive to (Greater Toronto Area), if you will. You look at Barrie, Kitchener-Waterloo, London and Oshawa, those markets still continue to have typically a higher average sale price than we do, but we\u2019re closing the gap drastically.\u201d Johnstone said a lot of sellers are adjusting to the market.\u201cThey\u2019re saying I used to list my house and you\u2019d get me an offer, and then we would go and look, and we\u2019re actually recommending now that we go out and find the house and buy it first, and then we list theirs because it\u2019s such a sellers market that buyers are at sort of the seller\u2019s whim.\u201d He said investors and retirees from across the province and abroad are also purchasing property in Niagara due to its close proximity to the GTA.\u201cThe region\u2019s supply simply isn\u2019t built to handle this amount of demand.\u201d But Johnstone said unlike some areas throughout Ontario that are \u201cland squeezed,\u201d there\u2019s available land in Niagara.\u201cOur builders are stepping up,\u201d he said, adding he recently spoke to a company that does a lot of foundation work that have had to add three more crews just to keep up with new home construction.\u201cNiagara builders \u2026 build a great product. They\u2019re not builders that build to code, they build really great product, and a lot of them are selling out. I think you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a new home that you could close on in 2017 right now.\u201d Nationally, Canada\u2019s residential real-estate market also saw substantial price growth in the first quarter of 2017, increasing 12.6 per cent year-over-year to $574,103. The price of a two-storey home rose 13.9 per cent year-over-year to $681,728, and the price of a bungalow increased 11 per cent to $490,018. During the same period, the price of a condominium increased 8.9 per cent to $372,638. While the majority of housing markets in Canada posted modest gains, price appreciation across much of Ontario significantly outpaced the rest of the country. Meanwhile, the pace of year-over-year home-price appreciation in greater Vancouver was noticeably lower than the historic highs seen in 2016.\u201cFor the first time in several years, real-estate markets in Vancouver and Toronto are headed in opposite directions,\u201d said Phil Soper, Royal LePage\u2019s president and chief executive officer.\u201cThe Vancouver market stalled, as confused consumers took to the sidelines after a series of uncoordinated moves by all three levels of government. With its housing shortage becoming more acute, Toronto easily stepped forward to assume the title of Canada\u2019s most overheated real-estate market.\u201d Significant home-price appreciation, caused by market dynamics similar to those that have driven housing activity in the GTA, is being seen across the entire Golden Horseshoe region of south-central Ontario, and as far away as Windsor and London in southwestern Ontario. The torrid pace of home-price appreciation in much of Ontario contributed almost half of the national aggregate home-price increase in the first quarter, with the rest of Canadian appreciating by a healthy, but much lower, 6.4 per cent year-over-year when excluding all Ontario-based regions.\u201cThe overall Canadian market is healthier in 2017 than it has been in years, yet the downside risks are greater, too,\u201d said Soper.\u201cOur economy, which has recovered nicely from the 2014 oil crisis, is sadly dependent on moves by an unpredictable U.S. federal government and can be swayed by unforeseen global events, such as fallout from Europe\u2019s restructuring. Still, housing activity is strong and prices are rising at a healthy mid-single-digit rate across the land. The trend in Alberta, Quebec and Atlantic Canada is particularly encouraging. Our concerns with the state of Canadian real estate begin and end in Toronto and Vancouver.\u201d ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:24:08.000+03:00"}]
