PHOTO: Harley Davidson / Special to Niagara Falls Review Change text size for the story Print \nReport an error \nNiagara College has announced it will be selling its Niagara Falls property and moving its programs to the Welland and Niagara-on-the-Lake campuses. \nIn a release issued Tuesday, college president Dan Patterson said the decision coincides with $65 million in redevelopment projects slated for the Welland and Niagara-on-the-Lake locations. \n\u201cWe felt the timing is right for this move,\u201d he said. \u201cThis creates an opportunity to move the programs that operated in Niagara Falls to the Welland and Niagara-on-the-Lake campuses, while providing the best possible facilities for teaching and learning. \n\u201cWhile this decision is driven primarily by our commitment to our students, it also makes financial sense at a time when sound fiscal management is more important than ever. Especially as new and improved spaces become available at our full-service Welland and Niagara-on-the-Lake campuses.\u201d \nThe Niagara Falls campus on Dunn Street was home to hairstyling, hospitality and tourism management, and international business management programs. It has about 70 students and 30 staff. \nNiagara College media adviser Susan McConnell said current classes will not be interrupted. \n\u201cThe closure\u2019s going to happen when the classes are finished, and it\u2019s a one-year program. So we\u2019re not moving anybody in the middle of a program.\u201d \nIn an e-mail to Niagara Falls Mayor Jim Diodati sent Monday, Patterson said no jobs will be affected by the decision. \nDiodati said he was told of the college\u2019s decision during a meeting with Niagara College April 7, along with Chief Administrative Officer Ken Todd and Director of Business Development Serge Felicetti. He shared the news in an e-mail to councillors Tuesday morning. \n\u201cEven with this news, I want to let you know that our discussion focused on keeping connected with Niagara College and including Niagara Falls in the college\u2019s future plans, but in a more meaningful way than in the past,\u201d he wrote. \nHe also urged the college to \u201creinvest\u201d the sale of the property back into Niagara Falls. \nWhen reached Tuesday, Diodati said the college would continue discussing ways to partner with the city\u2019s plans for a downtown education incubator and business hub. \n\u201cWe want to create an educational concept that commercializes/supports entrepreneurial ideas, that will lead to a concept of creating jobs and attracting investment,\u201d he said. \nHe maintains that plans for a Ryerson University presence downtown are still alive, despite the university\u2019s proposal for federal grant funding being turned down last year. \n", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:24:13.000+03:00"}]
