(HARLEY DAVIDSON/SPECIAL TO THE REVIEW/POSTMEDIA NETWORK) Change text size for the story Print \nReport an error \nDrummond Road, between Crawford Street and Sheldon Avenue, has been temporarily closed as the city repairs a watermain break. Traffic has been impacted in that area since last Wednesday, when the city found a sink hole was developing.\u201cWhat we did was put an arrow board up to shift traffic over ... just to avoid that sink hole while we could develop a game plan,\u201d said James Sticca, the municipality\u2019s drinking water quality management system coordinator.\u201cWhat we thought with the long weekend coming, we didn\u2019t know what the nature of the repair was going to be at the time, so typically without having two days to perform the work, we knew Thursday would be our only day to do the work, so we put it off until (Tuesday).\u201d The city put out a public advisory last Thursday indicating the road would be closed Tuesday.\u201cOur original plan of waiting for a two-day window to perform the repair has kind of come through as we put it off to this week, knowing that it takes some time to dig down and find out what the issue is.\u201d Sticca said that section of Drummond Road will remain closed into Wednesday, but he hopes it will reopen by the end of the day. He said updates will be provided Wednesday to advise the public when that section of Drummond Road will reopen. ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:24:11.000+03:00"}]
