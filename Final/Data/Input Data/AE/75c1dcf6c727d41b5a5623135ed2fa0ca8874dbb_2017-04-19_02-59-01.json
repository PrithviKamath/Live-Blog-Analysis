Held under the guidance and patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, the prestigious Abu Dhabi Awards encourage the citizens and residents of Abu Dhabi to nominate people who have undertaken a good deed that has benefited the community whether in Al Ain region, Al Dhafra region or Abu Dhabi city.

We hope that people from across the Emirate will join with us to nominate and recognise the good amongst us\u201d. \nSince their inception in 2005, the Abu Dhabi Awards have recognised 71 unsung heroes who have made a positive impact on society in the Emirate.

The contributions from past Award recipients have covered several different areas; from medical research and lifetime achievements to overseas humanitarian relief and the preservation of UAE and Abu Dhabi culture and history. \nOnce the nomination period closes, all entries will be evaluated by the Abu Dhabi Awards Organising Committee, comprising leading dignitaries, officials and senior industry figures, who will produce a shortlist of the most qualified candidates. The Committee then further examines each of these nominations, while creating a detailed study on the work and contribution of each of the individuals.
