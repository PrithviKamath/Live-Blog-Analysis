We have examined the place of double counting and rapid screening of FISH and when it is and is not safe to do so. This analysis has been facilitated greatly by the inclusion of custom scripts embedded in a spreadsheet used for recording the data.\nResults There were no differences in scoring profiles in relation to testing machine or reagent batch for both HER2 IHC and FISH. There was excellent concordance in scoring by the biomedical scientists and pathologists providing the service. There is a significant difference between the proximity of scores in double-scored cases with HER2 copy number >6.0 compared with those with copy number <6.00. It is safe to single score with rapid screening of HER2 FISH following a first count with a HER2/CEP17 ratio <1.5 and a HER2 copy number <3.5.\nConclusions Single counting of HER2 FISH supported by a second rapid screen is safe and practicable within strict parameters. Any assessment of proximity of scores in double-scored cases should take into account the HER2 copy number, with greater spreads experienced at higher copy numbers. Centralising HER2 testing in a regional centre allows detailed audit of the entire analytical process.\n\n\nfrom Anatomy Pathology via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2oKfRGx\nvia IFTTT ", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "0ad426885de105190ae014f2feb1066c373570d7", "highlightText": "", "rating": null}]
