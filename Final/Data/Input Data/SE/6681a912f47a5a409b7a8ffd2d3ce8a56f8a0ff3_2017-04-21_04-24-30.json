Now, the Calgary Flames are one defeat from being swept out of the playoffs. \nCorey Perry capped a crazy Anaheim Ducks comeback 1:30 into overtime at the Scotiabank Saddledome on Monday night when his centering attempt banked off a couple Flames and wound up in the net for a 5-4 Ducks triumph. It was a stunning final blow in a game that saw Anaheim crawl out of a 4-1 deficit to snatch victory. \nNow, thanks in large part to two goals from defenceman Shea Theodore and a three-point night by grinder Nate Thompson, the Pacific Division champs are one win from advancing thanks to a 3-0 series lead. \n\u201cA 4-1 game, you gotta close that out,\u201d said Flames captain Mark Giordano . \u201cThere\u2019s no excuses.\u201d \nThere are, of course, reasons when something like this happens and there\u2019s no hiding from the reality that goalie Brian Elliott had a large hand in Calgary\u2019s undoing. \nThe Flames appeared to be cruising near the end of the second period, riding power-play goals from Sean Monahan , Kris Versteeg and Sam Bennett , as well as an even-strength marker by Michael Stone to a three-goal cushion that prompted Anaheim coach Randy Carlyle to yank John Gibson in favour of Jonathan Bernier . The shots after 40 minutes were 24-14 in favour of the Flames, but one of the Ducks\u2019 last attempts \u2013 a sharp-angle floater from Theodore \u2013 eluded the glove of Elliott. \nIn a sombre Flames room, the goalie shouldered much of the blame. \n\u201cThat\u2019s not an easy one, especially personally,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel I played very well and I let the team down a little bit. \n\u201cI have to own that. It\u2019s not an easy thing to do. The guys spotted four goals, we should win a game like that.\u201d \nWhile Calgary was still in prime position to do so after 40, there\u2019s no doubt Anaheim sprung to life after the goal. In fact, the Ducks nearly made it 4-3 in the dying seconds of the middle frame when Jakob Silfverberg rang one off the post. \n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t seem to make two passes together for the better part the first two periods,\u201d said Carlyle. \u201cWe got a goal that gave us some life and made us believe that we have a chance.\u201d \nBased on past precedent, that should not have been the case. Calgary was lights out when it came to closing games in the regular season, posting a league best .971 points percentage in contests it led after two periods. \nAnd for 10 minutes of the third, there was no further indication of an Anaheim threat until Thompson \u2013 who was bumped up from the fourth line to the third during the game \u2013 tipped home a point shot with a stick video review confirmed was under the league\u2019s legal height limit. \nThen, with fewer than five minutes remaining, a point shot from Theodore nicked off Bennett and found the net for the equalizer. By that point, the \u2018C of Red\u2019 was full of white knuckles as the home team crumpled. \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have enough push or drive,\u201d said Giordano. \u201cWe allowed them to come and a few shots from the point went in. We sort of shelled up a little bit.\u201d \nThe \u201cwhat if\u201d game will surely be played well into the night in Calgary. Both Monahan and Troy Brouwer had tap-in misses in the second period that inspired face palms and there\u2019s no denying Anaheim continues to be on the right end of some fortuitous breaks. \nGame 2 was decided on a puck that caromed off Lance Bouma \u2019s skate in the high slot and somehow found the net; for most of the time it took to review Thompson\u2019s deflection, Twitter was rife with non-partisans saying the goal would come back; Perry\u2019s overtime winner kicked off Elliott\u2019s stick, plunked Stone in the back of the leg while he battled Thompson on the lip of the crease and went into the net. \nStanley Cup Playoffs on Sportsnet NOW \nReady for playoff hockey?
