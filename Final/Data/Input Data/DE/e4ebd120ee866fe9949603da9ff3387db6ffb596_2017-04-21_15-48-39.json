This is my fourth pair of skechers. In about 3 months time of moderate use, a hole formed in the toe at the seam. This has never happened before.\nI do not still have my receipt, and I cannot remember the price I paid. They were purchased at Famous Footwear in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. What is most exasperating for me is trying to find a Skechers address or phone number to report this faulty product.\nI am not planning on purchasing anymore Skecher products.I cannot afford for them to be unwearable in three months time.\nReview about: Skechers Relaxed Fit Shoes.\nReview #1035527 ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:23:53.000+03:00"}]
