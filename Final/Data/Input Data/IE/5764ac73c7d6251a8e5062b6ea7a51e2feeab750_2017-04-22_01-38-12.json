I think I'm afraid he won't take the tablets and drink. But I think I will have to talk with him and try the Sinclair method. He would take the tablet 1/2 hours before he would normally drink which is late evening, he also smokes weed. So this tablet will not work (as good) or at all, u are better to drink on them only when u feel the need, he would normally drink every 2nd day", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "5764ac73c7d6251a8e5062b6ea7a51e2feeab750", "highlightText": "", "rating": null}]
