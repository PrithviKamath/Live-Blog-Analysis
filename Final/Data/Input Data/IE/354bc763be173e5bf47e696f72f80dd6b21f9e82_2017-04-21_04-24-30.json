The position will be reviewed on a continuous basis today and tomorrow. \n\u201cPatient care is paramount at CUH and this situation is being treated as a priority. Hospital management have requested that, where appropriate, the public contact their GP in the first instance and explore all other options available to them prior to attending the emergency department if their needs are not urgent.\u201d \nHospital management estimated another 150 patients would arrive at the ED by the end of yesterday and some of these will also need to be admitted. \nThey have appealed to potential patients not to present at the ED unless absolutely necessary and if appropriate, to consider South Doc; the Mercy Urgent Care Centre at St Mary\u2019s Campus, Gurranabraher; and the local injuries unit at Bantry General Hospital or MallowGeneral Hospital.
