When the couple said no and explained why they had moved, Hohl said the attendant denied their request for an upgrade and asked them to return to their original seats.\nHohl said that although he and Maxwell did as they were told, a US marshal boarded the flight and asked them to get off the plane. The couple said they complied with that demand as well but found the overall experience \"strange.\"\n\"They said that we were being disorderly and a hazard to the rest of the flight, to the safety of the other customers,\" Hohl said. \"I think customer service and the airlines has gone real downhill.\n\"The way United Airlines handled this was really absurd,\" Hohl added.\nUnited has disputed Hohl's version of events, saying the couple had repeatedly tried to sit in upgraded seats and refused to comply with requests to move back to their assigned seats.\n\"We're disappointed anytime a customer has an experience that doesn't measure up to their expectations,\" United said in a statement to KHOU . \"These passengers repeatedly attempted to sit in upgraded seating which they did not purchase, and they would not follow crew instructions to return to their assigned seats. We've been in touch with them and have rebooked them on flights tomorrow.\"\nUnited has been engulfed by controversy since a video emerged last week that showed 69-year-old David Dao being violently dragged off a flight after refusing to give up his seat to make room for crew members. Dao's attorney said on Thursday that Dao sustained injuries and planned to file a lawsuit against the airline.\nUnited has adopted a rule that crew members can't displace passengers already on board the plane, The Associated Press reported.\nMaggie Schmerin, a spokeswoman for United, said in an email to the AP on Sunday that the change was an initial step in a review of policies and was meant to ensure that situations like Dao's never happen again.\nNOW WATCH: Timeline of a crisis: How United's passenger-bumping debacle unfolded\nSee Also:\nHow the United Airlines incident broke the 2 golden rules in marketing UNITED PASSENGER ATTORNEY: Dao has a concussion, broken nose, and lost two front teeth How often airlines involuntarily bump passengers (United isn't the worst)"}]
