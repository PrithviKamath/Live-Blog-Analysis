In the US alone, the film has made a massive $100.2 million in its first week of release.\nAnd while that debut is a big drop on F urious 7 's domestic opening, which earned over $140 million in its first first week of release , it is also more than the rest of the films in the US Top 10 managed to make this week.\nCombined.\nView photos\nPhoto credit: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock More The film's global box office is expected to be in the region of $530 million, with the film receiving a massive boost from China, where it's racked up $135 million in just the first two days of release (via Variety ).\nA couple of reasons have been suggested for Furious 8 's drop in box office, ranging from the mixed reviews to the reported feud between actors Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson . There's also the fact that Furious 7 acted as a tribute to star Paul Walker , who was killed in a car crash in 2013, while Furious 8 doesn't have that same emotional resonance.\nEven so, when you manage to make $80 million more than your closest rival, it's not too bad going.\nAnd the film lagging so far behind Furious 8 is Fox and DreamWorks Animation's Alec Baldwin-starring The Boss Baby , which has been knocked off the top spot after bringing in $15.5 million.\nDisney's Beauty and the Beast drops another spot down into third place, taking in $13.6 million, but we bet the studio isn't too unhappy with the fall \u2013 especially considering it recently passed the $1 billion mark worldwide and became the biggest live-action musical ever.\nRounding out the top 5 is Smurfs: The Lost Village in fourth place and Going in Style , which stars Morgan Freeman, Alan Arkin and Michael Caine in fifth.\nView photos\nPhoto credit: BBC More Here is the weekend's top ten in full, as reported by Box Office Mojo :\n1.
