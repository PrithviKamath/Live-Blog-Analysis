With Bee Boo , the answer is yes.\nSHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Tom Walker  Photo: Supplied Tom Walker meets the audience outside his venue and guides them in, and we follow like Alice after the White Rabbit. But Walker's world is weirder than anything Lewis Carroll ever dreamed up.\nWith the unhinged, manic energy of a young Steve Martin, Walker delivers a rapid-fire series of physical and prop gags that leaves the audience confounded at first, but in stitches once they get on board (after a particularly silly bit about fishing, one could sense the crowd shift).\nWalker is keeping a tally of how many walk-outs his shows have had, which he hangs by the door. It's true, his brand of absurdity won't suit all tastes, but those who embrace his style will come away delightfully exhausted.Walker walks (no pun intended) the fine line between awkward anti-comedy and low-brow hilarity, and does it extremely well.", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91bHJN3vQZIxX61q00bn3sETrta6K0XFhnbyQTogJf5jrE7IUJ8G5rjKHQiSYD9h7_OF4eS4io7UYsvVVDKo9Fehxj8lsx7jzTvr9vfWvtUA_llanFTsFYSBieqo6yP.fHB_26RMmOzxoW366SRFRErzF7HZJwT5kq6qCZmU9LNZOZaGQgAZMkw99ror0ADURSRZab7rNZYvrUpMTG9SMbjncD4AqybBSCUs0b_IhWbxtaX315Wu9TGFEraXdY6aE-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T11:27:26.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "Melbourne Comedy Festival 2017 review: Tom Walker's absurdly silly show Bee Boo has audience in stitches", "thread": {"title_full": "Melbourne Comedy Festival 2017 review: Tom Walker's absurdly silly show Bee Boo has audience in stitches", "site_full": "www.canberratimes.com.au", "site": "canberratimes.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.canberratimes.com.au/rssheadlines/entertainment.xml#", "performance_score": 0, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": 28115, "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "country": "AU", "section_title": "Canberra Times Entertainment Headlines", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91bHJN3vQZIxX61q00bn3sETrta6K0XFhnbyQTogJf5jrE7IUJ8G5rjKHQiSYD9h7_OF4eS4io7UYsvVVDKo9Fehxj8lsx7jzTvr9vfWvtUA_llanFTsFYSBieqo6yP.fHB_26RMmOzxoW366SRFRErzF7HZJwT5kq6qCZmU9LNZOZaGQgAZMkw99ror0ADURSRZab7rNZYvrUpMTG9SMbjncD4AqybBSCUs0b_IhWbxtaX315Wu9TGFEraXdY6aE-", "published": "2017-04-16T11:27:26.000+03:00", "title": "Melbourne Comedy Festival 2017 review: Tom Walker's absurdly silly show Bee Boo has audience in stitches", "uuid": "3472d312fb1ae7ac56501ea23615d00594f6a525", "main_image": "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/v/l/6/l/u/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gvl4yo.png/1492329194155.jpg"}, "uuid": "3472d312fb1ae7ac56501ea23615d00594f6a525", "ord_in_thread": 0}]
