spoiled efforts by the Group of Seven industrialised countries to reach a common stance on energy when it asked for more time to work out its policies on climate change. \nPresident Trump signed an order in March to undo climate change regulations drawn up under his predecessor President Barack Obama, calling into question US support for an international deal to fight global warming. \nReuters Newsagency reports the order\u2019s main target was President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, requiring states to slash carbon emissions from power plants. \nThat action was a key factor in US ability to meet commitments under the United Nations sponsored Paris Agreement on climate change reached by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015. \nAt a news conference wrapping up the G7 Energy meeting in Rome, Italian industry and energy minister Carlo Calenda said the US was reviewing its strategy on climate change and the Paris Agreement. \n\u201cWhile this is under way, the US reserves its position on these key priorities,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt was not possible to sign a joint declaration since it would not cover the whole range of topics in the agenda.\u201d \nMr Calenda, who chaired the G7 meeting, said all other European Union countries remained strongly committed to the Paris Agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions. \nSpeaking from Madrid later, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said Europe would \u201crespect everyone\u2019s opinion on the matter but it would not accept making any steps backward with respect to the strategic choices made on climate change\u201d. \nMr Gentiloni is due to meet President Trump at a G7 summit Italy will host in Sicily next month, with Italy anxious to get public backing from all leaders on the Paris Agreement. \nReuters reports a source close to the G7 talks said the inability of US Energy Secretary Rick Perry to commit showed the isolation of the US at the ministerial meeting. \n\u201cThe US also wanted to include references to coal and fossil fuels,\u201d the source said. \nDuring his election campaign, President Trump pledged to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord, arguing it would hurt US business. \nEnvironmental groups have criticised the administration\u2019s order, arguing it runs dangerously counter to the global trend toward cleaner energy technologies. \nHowever, Washington has still not spelt out its stance on the Paris Agreement and some officials hope there is room for manoeuvre. \n\u201cThe talks were constructive and there was no friction,\u201d Mr Calenda said. \nThe Italian minister was due to hold bilateral talks with Mr Perry later.
