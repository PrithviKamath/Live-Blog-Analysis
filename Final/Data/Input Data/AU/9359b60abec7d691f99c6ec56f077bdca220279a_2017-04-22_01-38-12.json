We bought the Charge 2 as a result.\nIt's a neat bit of kit, nice screen and easy to use.\nOf course the FitBit itself is only part of the package. The app is also very user friendly. It's really simple to record food and drink intake and to review progress.\nUnfortunately just wearing it isn't going to make anyone fitter. Work has to be done! It's a great little device for recording general activity and specific fitness workouts. As an observer, 'buying in' to the FitBi Read more t provides motivation to git the steps goals, eat better and get some workouts in too.\nFor active people it's a good tracker. I doubt it will be enough to encourage committed couches potatoes to change their ways but anyone needing a little bit of a motovation boost may find it works for them.", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "9359b60abec7d691f99c6ec56f077bdca220279a", "highlightText": "", "rating": 5.0}]
