Am I going mad?!\nI'm trying to add 'Who Deleted Me', to Vivaldi, as it received a good review in the latest issue of Webuser, but I can't find a link on the www.deleted.io page to the extension!\nIf I click the 'Who Deleted Me' link on the top right, it says to go the 'front page' to add the extension, but I can't find it! I've tried looking in 2 different browsers and I can't see a link to the extension - am I missing something obvious? I tried switching of my adblocker and all that did was show download buttons for unsafe software/PUPs.\nHelp, please!\nThank you,\nIan.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "uuid": "c279077a10d5829d44db24a082a423182f041aa2", "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "title": "Who Deleted Me", "thread": {"country": "GB", "site": "webuser.co.uk", "replies_count": 1, "title_full": "Who Deleted Me - Web User Forums", "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 0, "section_title": "All other topics - Web User Forums", "domain_rank": null, "uuid": "c279077a10d5829d44db24a082a423182f041aa2", "main_image": "", "site_type": "discussions", "title": "Who Deleted Me", "spam_score": 0.006, "site_section": "http://forum.webuser.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?f=205", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzZ.EUdF940FgQEB33t.lyHOPZw7n52roQ2LFltC2HIRkhZcpbifs0jFPm7Ecw7veE-", "participants_count": 2, "site_full": "forum.webuser.co.uk", "social": {"linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "published": "2017-04-17T10:56:00.000+03:00"}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T11:26:35.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzZ.EUdF940FgQEB33t.lyHOPZw7n52roQ2LFltC2HIRkhZcpbifs0jFPm7Ecw7veE-", "highlightText": "", "published": "2017-04-17T10:56:00.000+03:00", "author": "IRM072005"}]
