The site on the former grocers Robson's and Sons and Bebbington's Wrought Iron Centre at the Triangle had the benefit of being close to the town centre and had good transport links. \nIt also had the potential for a much larger building than the former library enabling it to provide better facilities and a better service to bring it into the 21st century. \n\"In 1893 the Public Libraries Act of 1892 was adopted in Bournemouth and the first Bournemouth Libraries Committee was appointed. In 1895 the mayor, Merton Russell Cotes, opened a public library in Old Christchurch Road, and then in 1901 the Central Library moved to Dean Park Road,\" said Medi Bernard, Bournemouth Libraries Service and Strategy Manager. \nThe Central Library at the Lansdowne was built on the site of a house called Peachley, together with the Municipal College. Designed by the borough surveyor, F W Lacey, the land cost \u00a31,500 and the building cost \u00a37,000. \nOpened by the mayor, Alderman H.S. McCalmont Hill in 1913, Lansdowne Library consisted of a lending library and a newsroom, a reference library and magazine room, the John BM Camm Reference Library as well as offices. \nThe lending library contained 23,000 volumes arranged by the Brown subject classification. \nIn the newsroom there were 34 daily and weekly magazines plus railway guides and directories while in the magazine room there were 60 periodicals plus Quick Reference works such as yearbooks. \nThe John BM Camm Music Reference Library was the first of its kind in the country. The 1,855 volumes were presented to the town by Camm in 1910. \nOver the years the Lansdowne Library was developed internally. In 1924 steel galleries were erected in the Reference Library, in 1936 changes to the newspaper and magazine rooms were carried out and a passenger lift was installed in 1940. \n\"However by 1939 a review of the Bournemouth Library Service said the Central Library was too small for a town and population the size of Bournemouth. In 1948 the Education Committee was asked to approve the taking over of the Central Library for an extension to the Municipal College. The Public Libraries Committee had to search for a new site for the Central Library,\"said Medi. \nIn 1966 approval for a proposal to build a new Central Library was sought by the Bournemouth Libraries and Museums Committee. In 1996 the plans for a new Central Library were put on hold until Local Government Reorganisation in 1997 when Bournemouth Library Service became part of Bournemouth Borough Council again.", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "bbf3a43b1f6bb5aadb3d263dc3ba2298fbc1827a", "highlightText": "", "rating": null}]
