And what\u2019s wrong with that?\nWe use Instagram now to plan where we\u2019re going to eat next and what we\u2019re going to eat when we get there. There\u2019s still cynicism about this, but it\u2019s marketing gold dust. With such a shift in how we navigate our appetites, you wonder: would any chef admit to creating food specifically for Instagram?\nRankin wouldn\u2019t. \u201cInstagram is a great way of publicising your business, but I\u2019ve never intentionally made food for it. Most of my food is pretty basic in terms of presentation. You\u2019re probably doing something wrong if you\u2019re relying on Instagram to fill your restaurant.\u201d He\u2019d prefer to attract attention with the \u201cquality\u201d of his flavours rather than the photogenic appeal of \u201csome tarted up iconic dish that fails to deliver\u201d.\nSunday roast with a smokey twist. Fantastic British meat, great drinks and service again @temperlondon #sundayroast #britishbeef #yorkshirepudding\nA post shared by John Rowland (@rowland.jw) on Apr 2, 2017 at 6:59am PDT\nJames Lowe, head chef and owner of Lyle\u2019s in east London \u2013 a restaurant known for its simple, elegant presentation \u2013 offers equally unminced words. \u201cDo I create dishes specifically for Instagram? No. Am I aware of what people tend to \u2019gram? Yes. Do we use that knowledge to create something more \u2019grammable? No. I know places that have a great feed, but the food is rubbish. I call it \u2018cooking for pictures\u2019.\u201d\nLowe stresses \u201cthe most important thing for any dish is how it tastes\u201d, but in some cultures looks are incredibly important. Across the Far East, even the presentation of street food can be a high priority. The photogenic nature of something like bao \u2013 steamed buns found in many Chinese cuisines \u2013 is incidental. However, when the Taiwanese street-food outfit Bao found a bricks and mortar home in 2015, a permanent queue formed once people started \u2019gramming one dish: the fried chicken gua bao. Queues remain because people return for more.\nLooks and taste colliding in this way was a happy accident for Bao\u2019s owners, and other small businesses who have found Instagram success with one iconic product. The novelty factor could wear off quickly if the pleasure of eating doesn\u2019t match the pleasure of looking. But sometimes Instagram fame is unpredictable. Sometimes the pleasure comes not from the beauty of a perfectly precise colour palette, but instead in seeing something so squidgy and bulbous it makes you laugh, like the doughnuts from Bread Ahead , a bakery stall in London\u2019s Borough Market, which are now both the business\u2019s main selling point and something for which people pilgrimage from afar, all due to Instagram.\n'Do-Nut' say NO to that.\nA post shared by MAO\ud83e\udd40 (@teemaomao) on Jan 9, 2017 at 5:42am PST\nWhat if you\u2019re a food business and don\u2019t want to wait for your happy accident, though? Can you get \u2019gram notoriety with a dish that prioritises beauty over taste?\nIt appears so. Last year, New Yorkers started \u2019gramming a see-through dessert that looked like a breast implant. The \u201craindrop cake\u201d, created by Darren Wong and sold at the Smorgasburg food market in Brooklyn , prompted headlines such as \u201cThis Dessert Looks Just Like a Blob of Water and I Can\u2019t Look Away\u201d, but \u201ctasteless\u201d was a common review. At $8 (\u00a36.90) it seemed, in more ways than one, a bit of a transparent gimmick. And now it\u2019s coming to the UK.\nBangkok restaurateur Fah Sundravorakul is putting it on the menu at the London ramen pop-up Yamagoya next month. I was invited to try one. God, but it looks stunning \u2013 like some sort of deep sea creature; gently trembling beside crushed peanut powder and brown-sugar syrup. Piercing it feels monstrous. Taste wise, it\u2019s\u2026 well, it\u2019s sweet, cold gloop that liquefies in the warmth of your mouth \u2013 quite exciting, but only the subtlest of flavours come from the powder and syrup. It\u2019s too weird to be a gustatory joy, but I immediately take a picture and wonder when I\u2019ll be able to post it. Is this the point?\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jelly beautiful: the \u2018raindrop cake\u2019. Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen for the Observer\nSundravorakul prefers to give some context on the dish first. \u201cIt\u2019s not from Brooklyn,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has been very popular in Japan for a few years.\u201d The \u201ccake\u201d is a mizu shingen mochi , or water mochi \u2013 a jelly-like dish made from water sourced in the southern Japanese Alps, which Sundravorakul has shipped over. The Japanese \u201cenjoy the cool texture\u201d and the \u201cchallenge to your senses\u201d. That it loses its agar-set form after 30 minutes makes it an ephemeral experience \u2013 much like Instagram. Sundravorakul won\u2019t directly admit he\u2019s bringing the dish here for \u2019gram potential, but will say: \u201cWe are aware of how powerful social media is.\u201d We stare at the cake, now melting, for some time.\nLowe believes that creating a dish specifically for Instagram is \u201cdishonest\u201d. It\u2019s hard to disagree. If you\u2019re paying for something that looks magical but tastes like a trick, something is wrong. Or is it? Critics wonder what\u2019s being lost as food becomes social currency for the digital age, but if it\u2019s a luxury people can still afford, can we really make critical judgments about the ways in which it provides them with fleeting pleasures? Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to choose which filter to use: Lark or Lo-Fi.\nTopics Food & drink The Observer Instagram Chefs Restaurants features ", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nxRVSxDLeMLrhzhN2Ks1oMV2gpY2N2dZPrxrsRduZ9ATy9afHCn.tDVXWSadiBtqURIt6NiRGyMJN_RXZ.xaTs.ZQiOaBtXxj", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T08:34:10.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "Food that looks good enough to\u2026 Instagram", "thread": {"title_full": "Food that looks good enough to\u2026 Instagram", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/rssfeed/0,,13,00.xml", "performance_score": 2, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 3}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "facebook": {"likes": 200, "shares": 200, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 11}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": 170, "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "country": "GB", "section_title": "The Guardian", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nxRVSxDLeMLrhzhN2Ks1oMV2gpY2N2dZPrxrsRduZ9ATy9afHCn.tDVXWSadiBtqURIt6NiRGyMJN_RXZ.xaTs.ZQiOaBtXxj", "published": "2017-04-16T08:34:10.000+03:00", "title": "Food that looks good enough to\u2026 Instagram", "uuid": "b77df9dcaab9b29ce6215b3a1f8e72508d5fcf67", "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f705509b78eff090e0abfd7ea37ee6b9523cf615/0_711_7680_4610/master/7680.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=a6fe38a45b34b8fcf0a837c40db1c315"}, "uuid": "b77df9dcaab9b29ce6215b3a1f8e72508d5fcf67", "ord_in_thread": 0}]
