Camping costs \u00a325 per person if booked in advance, with a late night bar and Santa Pod\u2019s funfair in action all evening.\n\nAn early bird offer also applies to show day tickets - \u00a318 (plus booking fee), as opposed to \u00a323 on the gate. To buy tickets, visit www.performancevauxhallshow.co.uk \n\nFor the first time in 2017, there will be a second Performance Vauxhall Show later in the year, which takes place at Rockingham Motor Speedway, Northants, on October 15. A special double discount package is on offer for Vauxhall clubs that want to attend both. \nSocial Media: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PV_Show   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PerformanceVauxhall   \nWebsite:  \nwww.performancevauxhallshow.co.uk   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down to read more articles like this which have been published recently \n\nWhy not Sign-up to Receive these Articles by Email each Day \nEnter your email address:\n\n\nDelivered by FeedBurner \n\n* Read more current and archived articles on our dedicated website * \nLow Cost and Free Publicity - Your company can easily benefit from some publicity like this in return for a contribution towards our layout costs (\u00a335 to \u00a355 plus VAT), payable via PayPal or credit card   or receive the service absolutely free of charge if you advertise (see below).\n\nWe post articles up to twice a day and never delete them - we only archive them each year so that they continue to remain visible to search engines.\n\nTo have your story published - just send us your news item, logo and image(s) and we will review the material, make any necessary changes to the wording / wordcount and then advise you when it will be published.\n\nIf you take display advertising or product and literature features in our printed and online publications, you will qualify for regular free postings on this blog while you continue to advertise with us.\n\nFor details on features and advertising rates please contact us or visit our website .\n\nDoor Industry Journal is a trading style of Avalon Innovations LLP Company Registration No. 06807833 \nReturn to The Door Industry Journal Website ", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SConF9mdv12jyJzYQAfDulVWG1HPBfggGIUVOUPfCPBgbQvoiG7TnXbKoQj0.eY1Vmj.QHJucNQu3Uc_XnRq17Gyw_AB8ixt8DWomBmBEfiaSg--", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T09:14:36.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "Celebrating the Cavalier with Attitude", "thread": {"title_full": "Celebrating the Cavalier with Attitude", "site_full": "blog.doorindustryjournal.co.uk", "site": "doorindustryjournal.co.uk", "site_section": "http://blog.doorindustryjournal.co.uk/", "performance_score": 0, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": null, "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "country": "GB", "section_title": "The Door Industry Journal", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SConF9mdv12jyJzYQAfDulVWG1HPBfggGIUVOUPfCPBgbQvoiG7TnXbKoQj0.eY1Vmj.QHJucNQu3Uc_XnRq17Gyw_AB8ixt8DWomBmBEfiaSg--", "published": "2017-04-16T09:14:36.000+03:00", "title": "Celebrating the Cavalier with Attitude", "uuid": "8d0bb7190d7e0d853e5d8ccad04d586381123e84", "main_image": null}, "uuid": "8d0bb7190d7e0d853e5d8ccad04d586381123e84", "ord_in_thread": 0}]
