Hmm - I would probably go for a BK XXLS 400 over a PB -1000. I think the BK model will be comparable to the 10\" PB 1000 in terms of depth and better in terms of musicality.\nNot too sure which PB 1000 review you have seen. However the SVS subs are very well regarded and they don't make a \"bad\" sub.\nThanks for the details about your setup. Seems good!\nWith regards to the WAF of both the BK & SVS models I would rate the BK models higher. The wood finishes can look really smart and the downward firing models don't even look too much like a speaker at all.\nIn fact this is where the BK Monolith's actually do a fairly good job of disguising themselves. They are so big if you add some nice cut (strengthened & edges rounded) glass to the top they can actually look like a nicely finished end table.\nWith regards to the Antimode I found a owners thread of sorts:\nViews on Anti-Mode 8033 Part 2...\nIt's part 2 but you could go back and read part 1 as well if you have LOTS of time on your hands.\nIt may answer some of your queries about it though from \"consumers\".", "ord_in_thread": 5, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "uuid": "39a13cede86598e1ce0b6cba6976c228c493107b", "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "title": "", "thread": {"country": "GB", "site": "avforums.com", "replies_count": 6, "title_full": "Question - Bk xxl400 or M plus | AVForums", "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 0, "section_title": "Subwoofers | AVForums", "domain_rank": 10709, "uuid": "3b5448e3558f9471156e4eb902a58f8c97e0776a", "main_image": "https://static.avforums.com/data/avatars/m/594/594351.jpg?1401737693", "site_type": "discussions", "title": "Question - Bk xxl400 or M plus", "spam_score": 0.0, "site_section": "https://www.avforums.com/forums/subwoofers.127/", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPKrDerPFzZzKpf8ePCLI.28qIPSoe63_Tu7I_yw9dirEw--", "participants_count": 6, "site_full": "www.avforums.com", "social": {"linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "published": "2017-04-17T10:01:00.000+03:00"}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T11:25:27.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPKrDerPFzZzKpf8ePCLI.28qIPSoe63_TuI6IWuN16cpMT98fry74qz", "highlightText": "", "published": "2017-04-18T11:25:27.000+03:00", "author": "speed1268"}]
