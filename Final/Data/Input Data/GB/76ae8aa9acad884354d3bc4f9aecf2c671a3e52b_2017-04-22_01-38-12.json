Imagine um determinado objetivo que tenha muita vontade de conseguir. Imagine que tem um baralho em m\u00e3os e abra as cartas sobre uma mesa. Cada carta posta na mesa \u00e9 uma consequ\u00eancia dos atos feitos para conseguir o que deseja. \u00c0 medida que vai pondo as cartas todas as consequ\u00eancias aparecem, tanto do ponto de vista mental como tamb\u00e9m o emocional.

Vale a pena ou n\u00e3o o trabalho para conseguir este desejo? \u201cCartas de baralho\u201d II Numa das palestras foi explicado como fazer para mudar a rea\u00e7\u00e3o emocional/mental de um trauma do passado. Basta fechar os olhos e voltar ao momento do trauma. Ent\u00e3o mudar a atitude mental/emocional para uma nova atitude positiva em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a aquilo. Voltar ao momento presente. Nos meses vindouros sentir\u00e1 as mudan\u00e7as acontecerem. Isto resolve os problemas do passado. Quanto ao presente pode-se usar a Causa\u00e7\u00e3o Descendente.
