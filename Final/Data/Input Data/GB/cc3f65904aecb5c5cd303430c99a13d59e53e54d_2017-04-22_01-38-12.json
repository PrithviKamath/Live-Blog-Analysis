Mark Farmer, author of the government-commissioned Farmer Review of the UK\u2019s skills shortage and CEO of Cast Consultancy, said: \n\u201cWhatever the outcome of this Election, the construction skills gap will remain as will the impact of Brexit. In the campaign to come, I hope to see some serious solutions on offer as part of the main parties\u2019 manifestos that adequately reflect the importance of the construction industry\u2019s welfare and future modernisation as part of its contribution to UK plc. We need to also preferably see a reasonable level of cross party consensus on a coherent and comprehensive skills and innovation agenda that is not interrupted by endless political turmoil!\u201d Lewis Johnston, RICS Parliamentary Affairs Manager, said: \n\u201cThe motivation for calling an Election is clear. With a working majority of just 17, the Government\u2019s freedom of action is restrained and understandably the Prime Minister wants a stronger mandate as she embarks on the EU Exit Negotiations. The real question is how the economy will react to yet another political rollercoaster ride. Since the EU referendum last summer, our market surveys across the residential, commercial and construction sectors show we have largely moved on from initial negative reactions but uncertainty continues to cloud the outlook and weigh on market sentiment. Today\u2019s decision does very little to change that prognosis in the near term, and if anything we are likely to see continuing deferral of major investment and hiring plans. \n\u201cWhilst Theresa May\u2019s stated intention this morning was to provide greater clarity and stability by calling a General Election, in the immediate term the move inevitably puts a question mark over policy and creates further uncertainty across the built environment. It is now the responsibility of all parties to set out clear policy proposals across land, property, construction and infrastructure to ensure the UK can deliver the homes, infrastructure, factories, offices and major building projects it needs to thrive.\u201d Mark Naysmith, UK CEO at WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff, said: \n\u201cRecent uncertainty has knocked confidence, particularly in the private sector where investment has stalled and project start-ups delayed. So a new government with a clear mandate should hopefully create a more stable environment that reinvigorates confidence. \n\u201cWith momentum building behind high speed rail, Heathrow, highways and other infrastructure investments, a snap Election presents the opportunity for the next government to build a strong mandate for speeding up the delivery of these vital long term projects. We would like to see firm manifesto commitments to these schemes, as well as a determined, clear pledge for producing more of the construction and STEM skills we need for delivery. \n\u201cIn the context of Brexit and the nascent Industrial Strategy, any future government needs to take a joined-up approach so that we can talk about the link between infrastructure investment and economic growth at a higher level. Whilst infrastructure delivery is supported by all main political parties in some form, 80% of the construction industry believes that the public doesn\u2019t understand the role it plays in enabling growth. We\u2019ll therefore be looking for parties to explain at a national and regional level why pro-infrastructure policies are good for UK plc, for productivity and for local housing, services and jobs.\u201d Julia Evans, BSRIA Chief Executive, said: \n\u201cBSRIA welcomes today\u2019s announcement that there will be a snap General Election. \n\u201cThe specific benefits for the construction industry remain to be seen, but it will allow the most wonderful platform for the Prime Minister to lay out her strategy to the electorate. It will be a strategy that will not be debated in parliament \u2013 as it properly should be \u2013 but it will be played out at the political hustings in the coming seven weeks. \n\u201cThere has been much chaos and mixed-messages surrounding Brexit since June last year so we trust this announcement will bring much-needed clarity and order in the Brexit debate and beyond. \n\u201cBefore all the detailed talks begin with the EU and Government sets out its vision and objections for Brexit legislation, such a General Election will demonstrate determination \u2018to get the job done\u2019. A stronger negotiating position will win the best deal on Brexit. \n\u201cIndustry needs strong leadership to avoid a disruptive cliff-edge. Indeed, as we move forward, we must not lose sight of the fact that it is crucial that the construction industry\u2019s voice is heard in the Brexit deliberations. What is evident is that the \u2018construction industry is open for business\u2019. \n\u201cWhoever forms the next Government needs to build a robust partnership between industry and Government that looks to future.\u201d", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "cc3f65904aecb5c5cd303430c99a13d59e53e54d", "highlightText": "", "rating": null}]
