Then as also advised on here changed between mode 2/4 on the Strata seeing which seemed best.Adjusting volume as I went. I might try the rca on the normal setting as the bass was strong, even when vocals had quietened off!\nThis arrangement worked very well, will only have to make a few adjustments here and there.On moderate volume my wife said a picture on the other side of the lounge wall was vibrating!!\nI run the AP, through a Tag 100x5r, onto ATC 40,C3C centre and MA Silver FX surrounds.\nDiscussed with the wife about running 2 subs, not got much chance! Doesn't like any of the set up in the lounge!! Lol, so if I buy another will have to sell the Strata!\nSo doesn't want anything much bigger, maybe get away with a xxl400, but that's about the max in size.\n@UEG has said about SVS, but the cost goes a little high and I can't really justify spending that much really\nHe also mentioned about using an anti mode, will have to read a bit more about their use.\nCheers speed Click to expand... Hi @UEG ,\nJust read the SVS PB-1000 review, What\nLooks very good, might just wait and save!!\nspeed", "ord_in_thread": 2, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "uuid": "acb657f005b505dffe83910c885a23b124ff5d54", "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "title": "", "thread": {"country": "GB", "site": "avforums.com", "replies_count": 6, "title_full": "Question - Bk xxl400 or M plus | AVForums", "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 0, "section_title": "Subwoofers | AVForums", "domain_rank": 10709, "uuid": "3b5448e3558f9471156e4eb902a58f8c97e0776a", "main_image": "https://static.avforums.com/data/avatars/m/594/594351.jpg?1401737693", "site_type": "discussions", "title": "Question - Bk xxl400 or M plus", "spam_score": 0.0, "site_section": "https://www.avforums.com/forums/subwoofers.127/", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPKrDerPFzZzKpf8ePCLI.28qIPSoe63_Tu7I_yw9dirEw--", "participants_count": 6, "site_full": "www.avforums.com", "social": {"linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "published": "2017-04-17T10:01:00.000+03:00"}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T11:25:27.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPKrDerPFzZzKpf8ePCLI.28qIPSoe63_TuI6IWuN16cpJUHJii7JKvW", "highlightText": "", "published": "2017-04-17T16:05:00.000+03:00", "author": "@speed1268"}]
