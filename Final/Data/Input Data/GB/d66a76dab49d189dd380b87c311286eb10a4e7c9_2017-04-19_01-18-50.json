He has grabbed eight goals and seven assists in 24 Bundesliga starts this season. \nBecause of his stature, he has been compared to Chelsea\u2019s N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, but this comparison is misguided. \nThe Guinean is more attack minded than Kante, and could be the perfect hybrid needed in Liverpool\u2019s midfield.

Comparing this to potential competitors for his position at Anfield, Jordan Henderson has 0.2, Emre Can 0.6 and Gini Wijnaldum 0.7. \nAs well as his dribbling, Keita has proven he can break lines with his creative passing. While he completes less passes and a lower percentage of his passes than Henderson, Wijnaldum and Can, he makes more key passes than all three. \nHe is a risk-taker, which has earned him seven assists this season. \nKeita has also scored an impressive range of goals this season, including a long range strike against Freiburg and a Messi-like run in the recent win over Mainz. \nOn top of his contribution going forward, Keita\u2019s defensive influence can not be underestimated. He has managed an impressive 2.6 interceptions per game in the league this season. Kant\u00e9 has 2.2, while Henderson has 1.7. Read More Who is Naby Keita? \nHis athleticism and speed allow him to cover a lot of ground, which would be a big addition to Jurgen Klopp\u2019s pressing style. \nHis strength and low centre of gravity make him nearly impossible to dispossess, which would aid the Reds in European competition, where many opposition teams will look to press the midfield. \nKeita would be a difficult signing to make due to interest from several of Europe\u2019s top clubs, with Bayern Munich one such team touted. \nDifficult would become impossible without Champions League football, and any deal for the the player would likely be a costly one. \nStill, if Klopp could lure the African star to Anfield, he would bring a bit of everything to the Liverpool midfield.
