It was a bestseller. Back in 1848, the author dared not publish under her own name: Anne Bront\u00eb . A woman to write such a book? Inequalities between the sexes are at the heart of her story; not all have been left behind in the 19th century.\nThe tenant in question, recently arrived with her small son and female servant, is Helen, whose mysterious ways excite local gossip and religious opprobrium. Having fled a vicious marriage (its circumstances timelessly cruel), Helen is obliged to be secretive. If discovered, she will lose her son; male-oriented laws favour a husband, whatever the circumstances. Helen\u2019s own moral convictions oblige her to discourage the love of local farmer, Gilbert, even though she reciprocates his feelings (Michael Peavoy ranges emotional scales of hope, jealousy, despair and resolution). They also compel her to return to nurse her injured husband (the tyrannical hell-fearing rake vividly played by Marc Small). Upright, determined, straight-spoken, strong without being aggressive or rude, religious but neither pompous nor pious, Helen\u2019s complex character is magnificently distilled by Phoebe Pryce in a performance of clarity and understated power.\nDeborah McAndrew\u2019s astute adaptation maintains Bront\u00eb\u2019s structure but alters events to dramatic effect, building on moments of discovery and decision that precipitate changes in the characters\u2019 situations. We live their choices with them. The contrasts between temporal and eternal realities underpinning Bront\u00eb\u2019s novel are conjured, in Amanda Stoodley\u2019s design, by broken, dry-stone walls suggesting snug homes and wild moors, and in Ben Occhipinti\u2019s soundscape, by cello notes bridging human tones and wuthering winds. Harmonising all these elements, Elizabeth Newman\u2019s direction finely tunes Bront\u00eb\u2019s past to our present.\n\u2022 At the Octagon theatre, Bolton until 22 April, then touring\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Topics Theatre The Observer Anne Bront\u00eb ", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_n0TsaDQijIcXIsLRFrj.zrdOmhrPdEhMwUHVnBjDjPc1C.dhNMvi2GweCuL.q7aZGg24ZlRLPLQ2D_HYQ5XULnnz8WT0_cyf8", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T10:52:26.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall review \u2013 vivid Bront\u00eb battle of the sexes", "thread": {"title_full": "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall review \u2013 vivid Bront\u00eb battle of the sexes", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/rssfeed/0,,41,00.xml", "performance_score": 2, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 258, "shares": 258, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": 170, "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "country": "GB", "section_title": "Stage | The Guardian", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_n0TsaDQijIcXIsLRFrj.zrdOmhrPdEhMwUHVnBjDjPc1C.dhNMvi2GweCuL.q7aZGg24ZlRLPLQ2D_HYQ5XULnnz8WT0_cyf8", "published": "2017-04-16T10:52:26.000+03:00", "title": "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall review \u2013 vivid Bront\u00eb battle of the sexes", "uuid": "050273c6478b780e66f5bca23a6bd407615373c6", "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b26426dfd2c91658f2b4458caf134abb8301edb/0_303_4933_2960/master/4933.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=e7c77ca9d8be175ae424bce891b1e857"}, "uuid": "050273c6478b780e66f5bca23a6bd407615373c6", "ord_in_thread": 0}]
