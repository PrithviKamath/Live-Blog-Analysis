Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who will meet senior officials of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) soon to review the power scenario, will write to PM Narendra Modi on the issue, it is learnt. (Follow The Tribune on Facebook ; and Twitter @thetribunechd ) Power consumers in the state will have to bear a burden of about Rs 2,750 crore (around 70 paise per unit) this fiscal due to non-utilisation of the fixed quota of power being generated by private sector thermal plants in the state. At the time of setting up such plants, the state entered into agreements with private players that it would pay fixed charges in case its power customers did not utilise the fixed quota of power generated at these plants. In fact, the burden has to be ultimately borne by power consumers in the state. With the setting up of three thermal plants in the private sector in recent years, there has been an addition of 3,950 MW in power generation against the requirement of 1,400-1,500 MW. \u201cPSPCL has to pay fixed charges to these private plants for not utilising the minimal fixed quota of power generated,\u201d said Padamjit Singh, former PSPCL Chief Engineer. During a visit to Pakistan, a representative of a leading corporate house negotiated to supply 4,000 MW to Pakistan from Gujarat. The power deficit in Pakistan is in the range of 35%. China has also offered to export power to it. Sources said if the deal materialised, the authorities would have to first synchronise the power transporting system of the two countries to match power frequency. The Pakistan power generation and supply system (based on American system) functions on a different frequency than the Indian power system, which follows the British pattern. It would take at least one year to set up high voltage direct current back-to-back module at the 400 KV grid, near Amritsar, to synchronise the supply systems of the two countries. The financial viability will also have to be examined. The average power generation cost in Punjab is around Rs 4.50 per unit. The power rates (in Indian currency) in Pakistan at the consumer end is said to be Rs 7-8 per unit."}]
