It's lost its credibility,\" Turnbull said at a press conference in Canberra. \nAnyone now in Australia on a 457 visa will not be affected by the new arrangements. \nThe 457 visa, now used by about 95,000 foreign workers, will be replaced by a new temporary visa and the list of occupations that qualify for a visa will be reduced from more than 200. \nThe new visa will be limited to a two-year period and a second four-year visa will require a higher standard of English language. From 1901 to around 1973, Australia restricted non-white immigration under a White Australia policy which required an English language test. \nThe Australian Industry Group (Ai Group), which represents more than 60,000 business, said the changes would improve the integrity of Australia's visa program. \n\"The temporary skilled visa program should now be considered as settled without the need for further reviews and disruptive policy change,\" said Ai Group Chief Executive Innes Willox. \nSome experts said the government should focus on boosting education and training systems to address Australia's skills needs. \nThe opposition was not impressed though. Labor leader Bill Shorten tweeted \"the only job Malcolm Turnbull cares about saving is his own.\" 0 0 Australia toughens foreign worker visas, says Australian jobs for Australians was posted in world of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on April 18, 2017 and was last updated on April 18, 2017.
