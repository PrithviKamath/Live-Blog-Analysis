When the couple said no and explained why they had moved, Hohl said the attendant declined their request for an upgrade and asked them to return to their original seats. \nHohl said that although he and Maxwell did as they were told, a US Marshall later boarded the flight and asked them to get off the plane. The couple said they complied with that demand as well, but found the overall experience \u201cstrange.\u201d \n\u201cThey said that we were being disorderly and a hazard to the rest of the flight, to the safety of the other customers,\u201d Hohl said. \u201cI think customer service and the airlines has gone real downhill. The way United Airlines handled this was really absurd.\u201d \nUnited has disputed Hohl\u2019s version of events, saying the couple had repeatedly tried to sit in upgraded seats and refused to comply with requests to move back to their assigned seats. \n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed anytime a customer has an experience that doesn\u2019t measure up to their expectations,\u201d United said in a statement to KHOU . \u201cThese passengers repeatedly attempted to sit in upgraded seating which they did not purchase and they would not follow crew instructions to return to their assigned seats. We\u2019ve been in touch with them and have rebooked them on flights tomorrow.\u201d \nUnited has been engulfed by controversy since a viral video emerged depicting 69-year-old David Dao being violently dragged off a United Airlines flight after refusing to give up his seat to make room for crew members. Dao sustained injuries and plans to file a lawsuit against the airline. \nAfter the incident involving Dao, United enacted a new rule stipulating that crew members will no longer be allowed to displace passengers already on board the plane, the Associated Press reported. \nUnited spokeswoman Maggie Schmerin said in an email to the AP on Sunday that the change is an initial step in a review of policies and it\u2019s meant to ensure that situations like Dao\u2019s never happen again.
