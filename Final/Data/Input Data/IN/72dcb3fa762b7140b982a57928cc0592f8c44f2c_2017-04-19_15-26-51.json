By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Published:April 16, 2017 5:24 pm Begum Jaan box office collection day 3: Vidya Balan plays a brothel madam in the film. \nBegum Jaan starring Vidya Balan seems to be struggling at the box office. The film didn\u2019t show growth on the second day as was expected. Instead, the film witnessed a drop in collections on Saturday. Begum Jaan collected Rs 3.50 crore on the second day in comparison to Rs 3.94 crore on opening day. The dip in the collection could be due to the Good Friday holiday on the first day. Trade analyst Taran Adarsh tweeted the figures, \u201c#BegumJaan declines on Day 2\u2026 Fri 3.94 cr, Sat 3.50 cr. Total: \u20b9 7.44 cr. India biz.\u201d The film could see a spike in collections on Sunday and collect a decent weekend collection. \nVidya has not been able to give a hit during past few years. Her last few films Kahaani 2 and Hamari Adhuri Kahani failed to do well at box office. Director Srijit Mukherji, however, doesn\u2019t seem to be bogged down by mixed reviews that film got from critics. In a recent post on Facebook , Srijit wrote, \u201cFor the statistically inclined, delighted to announce that despite mixed reviews, FF8, big regional new year releases and being an A rated film, #BegumJaan opened to 3.94 cr as opposed to the industry expectation of 3-3.25 cr and an ORMAX prediction of 3.4 cr. Thank you for all the bouquets and brickbats.\u201d #BegumJaan declines on Day 2\u2026 Fri 3.94 cr, Sat 3.50 cr. Total: \u20b9 7.44 cr. India biz. \n\u2014 taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) April 16, 2017 \nThe film is getting some tough competition from Hollywood action thriller Fast and Furious 8 starring Vin Diesel. There have also been some big regional releases that could be a reason behind Begum Jaan\u2019s dismal show at the box office. Films like Pa Pandi (Tamil), Sakhavu (Malayalam) and Manje Bistre (Punjabi) have got positive reviews. Earlier Taran tweeted about the same, \u201c#BegumJaan had a slow start\u2026 Evening shows better\u2026 #Furious8 wave + huge start of Punjabi film #ManjeBistre in North made a dent.\u201d \nAlso Read: Yami Gautam trashes rumours of Hrithik Roshan being miffed with her \nBegum Jaan was made on a moderate budget of Rs 14-15 crore and has recovered half of the investment from satellite and digital sales. Makers also found a huge tax relief of Rs 2 crore after the film has been declared tax-free in Jharkhand. Srijit Mukherji wrote on Twitter, \u201cDelighted to announce the Hon\u2019ble CM @dasraghubar has declared #BegumJaan tax-free for Jharkhand & has also extended a subsidy of Rs. 2 crores!\u201d For all the latest Entertainment News , download Indian Express App now \u00a9 IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd Tags:"}]
