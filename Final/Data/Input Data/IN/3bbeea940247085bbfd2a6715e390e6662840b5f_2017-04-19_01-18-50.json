Her journey in the limelight started when she won the annual Gladrags Megamodel India competition in 1995. From then till now, she has been able to stay relevant to her fans by the virtue of being a confident, spunky, and sassy badass! \nShe was born to a Punjabi father and an Anglo-Indian mother in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh on April 16, 1978. She was three-years-old when her family moved to Bangalore. Thanks to her upbringing, Dutta is fluent in English, Hindi, Punjabi, as well as Kannada. \nAfter securing the first place at the Miss Intercontinental Pageant in 1997, she went on to win the crown of Femina Miss India Universe in 2000. At the Miss Universe Pageant in 2000, Dutta received the highest individual score in the history of the contest because her final interview blew the judges' minds! She scored a 9.99; something no else had achieved before. She also won the crown; the second Indian to do so ever. The same year Priyanka Chopra won the Miss World title and Dia Mirza won the Miss Asia Pacific one. \nSoon after it was announced in 2001 that Dutta has been appointed as the UNFPA Goodwill Ambassador working on issue mainly related to gender sensitivity and the HIV-AIDS crisis in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. \nLara then made her Bollywood debut in 2003 with the film Andaaz , where she co-starred with Priyanka Chopra and Akshay Kumar. She won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for her role. \nThe year 2011, saw several new milestones in her life - both personal and professional. She tied the knot with celebrated tennis player Mahesh Bhupathi on February 16, and on August 1 she announced the news of her pregnancy. If her adorable Instagram posts with her daughter Saira, who was born on January 2012, are anything to go by, she seems like a super-fun mom.
