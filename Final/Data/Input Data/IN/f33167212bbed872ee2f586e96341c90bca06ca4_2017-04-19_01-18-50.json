The narrative wove in stories of two friends \u2014 Geeta and Premwati \u2014 of Peepli Khera village, even as it laid bare the disturbing gender inequality in India\u2019s work force. \nThe author \u2014 Ellen Barry, NYT 's South Asia Bureau chief \u2014 says the story was among the most challenging ones she pursued during her four-year stint in India, which comes to an end this August. \n\u201cThis is a subject I care about passionately: If more Indian women are able to earn for their families, I think that will have an enormous impact on the treatment and education of girls, age at first marriage and first childbirth, and problems like dowry-related violence and female feticide,\u201d said Barry via an e-mail. It is a problem that she believes has gotten far too little attention from the government and the research community. \u201cIt is a challenging subject because it is complex and not as shocking or attention-grabbing as problems like rape or honour killing. It was important to me to shift the focus.\u201d Ellen Barry's report on Indian women's struggles to access the labour market, as seen on the New York Times website \nThis story is also an absolute favourite of Barry\u2019s friend and colleague Geeta Anand, who also liked her second piece about young women (working) in manufacturing in Bengaluru, on the same subject. \u201cShe (Ellen) spent months with these women, finding those telltale anecdotes and descriptions that elevated the pieces into great literature. They are fresh stories and they are among the best narrative nonfiction I have ever read,\u201d says Anand, via an e-mail. \nBarry\u2019s quick turn-around time and great writing skills makes the mother of two daughters one of the most sought after journalists in the field. \u201cI loved her story about the injuries to protestors\u2019 eyes in Kashmir,\u201d says Anand. \u201cRead it. I was amazed that she could turn around a news feature in just two or three days and that it could be so compellingly written and deeply reported. She begins by describing the eye surgery to repair a damaged eye. Read it,\u201d she repeats. \nBarry though is never satisfied with her work and is always striving to be better. \u201cI think Ellen\u2019s great strength, besides her great talent, is her self-criticism. It\u2019s hard to give her a compliment, because she doesn\u2019t quite believe it,\u201d says Anand. \u201cEvery story of hers that you tell her was great, she\u2019ll point out the things that weren\u2019t quite up to her standard, where she should have done more. This tortures her. But it makes her a better and better journalist with every passing year.\u201d \nIn 2011, while posted in Russia, Barry was part of a team which won the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for highlighting instances of impunity in the country\u2019s justice system and also covered the resurgence of Russia\u2019s Cossacks; a meteor that slammed into the atmosphere there and a scandal at the Bolshoi Ballet, which started with a dancer throwing acid into the face of creative director. Ellen Barry will leave India this August, when her four-year stint as South Asia bureau chief for the New York Times ends. Image courtesy Ellen Barry's Facebook page \nIn August 2013, after five years in the former Soviet space, Barry was exhilarated to be India, which she says is a wonderful place to report as people are not afraid to speak their mind in public, including to reporters. \u201cIt is a free society in that sense. More frustrating is that top officials rarely feel compelled to answer challenging questions about policy and performance, which makes it difficult for journalists to hold them accountable,\u201d says Barry. \u201cThis country is full of excellent, courageous journalists. They need institutional support from outlets and their owners in order to hold leaders' feet to the fire.\u201d \nAs a bureau chief who shapes coverage of South Asia, Barry\u2019s extremely ambitious, stays well informed and is constantly looking for how to tell the most important stories of the region is the most compelling way, says Anand. \nOf Barry's understanding and coverage of India, Anand says Ellen is among a handful of westerners she has met who have amazed her with how rapidly they can understand a country, its history, its politics and its people. \u201cAnd so she wrote knowledgeably and with subtlety and compassion and curiosity about India.\u201d \nAnand also goes on to say that Barry\u2019s are almost always the best stories on whatever topics she tackles. \u201cHer strengths are her speed and her intelligence and her writing talent. She\u2019s also extremely hard working. Many people who are as talented writers might try to cut corners on the reporting. But Ellen makes twice as many calls as most reporters I know, and then begins writing. That means her stories are not only accurate but incredibly in-depth.\u201d \nNot everyone is as pleased with Barry's work. Avirook Sen, author of the book Aarushi , based on the double murder in Noida, picked on Barry at an event for her critical review of his book. \u201cI wrote a critical review of Avirook Sen\u2019s book on the murder investigation. He did not like my review,\u201d puts Barry simply. \nCome August, at the end of the stipulated four-year posting in any country by NYT , she will head to London to take on new responsibilities as Chief International Correspondent and is free to write on any region where she finds compelling stories, including India. But she plans to focus on Europe. \u201cI am interested in the rise of right-wing populism and nationalism in the west. This is a process I observed in Russia, where I was posted between 2008 and 2013. It also reflects political changes going on in the United States and the decline in the US's global influence,\u201d says Barry. \nAnand thinks that Barry has elevated the standard of journalism in India. \u201cWhen you read an Ellen Barry story, you knew it would be deeply reported and accurate and you knew it would be written more compellingly than anything else on the subject,\" says Anand. \"Her project on working women in India is the best feature writing I\u2019ve read since I\u2019ve been here.\" \nPublished Date: Apr 16, 2017 10:44 am | Updated Date: Apr 16, 2017 10:44 am Also See", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEJkx9ab7BGD.kN20f.SKuhIRaC7pvndxny8x_BumgPs09Oty_h5vYNPkBuda4F3nPhQw1UN_QtlmovjvNoQgSh_hO2MG6wOlpnMwKmph5tjt4RQRtVAWAyzYvJ6LJ3cMLYbKCq1kecTY4KqkRDbIOfw--", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T08:22:10.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "New York Times\u2019 Ellen Barry\u2019s India stint is ending; her compelling journalism will stay on", "thread": {"title_full": "New York Times\u2019 Ellen Barry\u2019s India stint is ending; her compelling journalism will stay on", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/firstpost/xfJh?utm_source=fp_footer", "performance_score": 1, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 157, "shares": 157, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": 1168, "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "country": "IN", "section_title": "Firstpost", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEJkx9ab7BGD.kN20f.SKuhIRaC7pvndxny8x_BumgPs09Oty_h5vYNPkBuda4F3nPhQw1UN_QtlmovjvNoQgSh_hO2MG6wOlpnMwKmph5tjt4RQRtVAWAyzYvJ6LJ3cMLYbKCq1kecTY4KqkRDbIOfw--", "published": "2017-04-16T08:22:10.000+03:00", "title": "New York Times\u2019 Ellen Barry\u2019s India stint is ending; her compelling journalism will stay on", "uuid": "f33167212bbed872ee2f586e96341c90bca06ca4", "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Ellen-Barry-Facebook-380.jpg"}, "uuid": "f33167212bbed872ee2f586e96341c90bca06ca4", "ord_in_thread": 0}]
