Since this is your first visit to the park I suggest you be sure your itinerary gives priority to exploring the Valley area itself.\nThe hiking ideas you laid out represent a very aggressive plan for all but the most trail-hardened, experienced hikers who know they can handle high altitude. You're talking about:\n- A Half Dome day of 14 miles and nearly 5,000 ft elevation gain and another 5,000 descent\n- A 4-Mile/Panorama day of 13.5 miles and 4,000 ft elevation gain and another 4,000 descent\n- A Cloud's Rest day of 14 miles and about 2,500 ft elevation gain and another 2,500 descent (in/out Sunrise)\n- What would be considered robust day hikes for many with Yosemite Falls , North Dome and Cathedral.\nYou're a kid in a candy store, you want EVERYTHING, and that's OK, I think people on this forum can appreciate that. Tell us more about your hiking experience -- your ideas aren't impossible but they would be feasible only for the fittest and most experienced hikers. And have you ever hiked at high altitude?\nHow many days are you planning for doing all this? Are you expecting to do all of these hikes on consecutive days, or with relaxed days in between?\nDo you have the equipment to backpack? If so you would see a lot more and could have a more relaxed pace as well since you won't necessarily be doubling back to civilization every night like with all dayhikes. Your plans have you crossing in and around LYV a few times, with backpacking you could be much more efficient with your mileage, for example hike to LYV and use that as a basecamp to do HD one day, CR another, and then finish by going up the Panorama and down the 4-Mile (or start with the 4-Mile and end with the Mist). Just a thought.\nEDIT: was typing my reply when the first reply posted, good advice there too.\nEdited: yesterday, 02:28 One attraction mentioned in this post 1 Cloud's Rest Ranked #38 of 83 things to do in Yosemite National Park 31 Reviews"}]
