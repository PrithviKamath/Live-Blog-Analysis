I am also planning to hike the 4 mile-Glacier Point- Panorama- Mist Trail loop as well, though I understand there is overlap b/w this 2 trails (Mist Trail). One other trail I'm interested is Clouds Rest off Tioga Rd. Are these good mix of trails for Yosemite?\nI have one more full day, looking for your input:\none more trail in Yosemite Valley such as Upper Yosemite Falls? or in Tioga Road area such as North Dome , Cathedral lakes? Or any other suggestion?\nMy last day will be a 1/2 day which I am hoping to visit Mariposa Grove if it's open by that time.\nLodging wise, I have 2 nights in the Valley, 1 in Lee Vining (easy access to Tioga?), 1 in Yosemite Bug (to save money), and will be using FAT.\nTIA\n5 places Half Dome Ranked #4 of 83 things to do in Yosemite National Park 1 124 Reviews 2 Mist Trail Ranked #6 of 83 things to do in Yosemite National Park 659 Reviews 3 Yosemite Valley Ranked #2 of 83 things to do in Yosemite National Park 4 775 Reviews 4 North Dome Ranked #61 of 83 things to do in Yosemite National Park 4 Reviews 5 Lee Vining See all 5"}]
