Wow, hope he's fit\n2. Hope he's got really good knees\n3. Hope he's got some time to acclimatise to the elevation\nI think Yosemite Falls would we well and truly dry by October, so I'm not sure I'd include that unless you're after the view of Yosemite Valley from above.\nIs your Half Dome hike your first day in Yosemite (not including your arrival day)? Will you have a car?\nI was going to suggest you consider Cathedral Lakes as a recovery session after Half Dome. However, this would require you to drive from the valley to the high country and back to the Valley. Or you could drive to Glacier Point and hike as much of the Panorama trail as you like and then return to Glacier Point. Then you wouldn't have to worry about returning to your car or repeating The Mist Trail portion that you already covered on your Half Dome hike.\nIf you have one night in Lee Vining , were you thinking of hiking Clouds Rest before or after that night?\nI'm trying to see how you would fit these hikes in:\nDay 1: Arrive from FAT (assume in own vehicle)\n? what time ? time for a hike ? Glacier Point Sentinel Dome ?\n>> overnight in Yosemite Valley\nDay 2: Half Dome\n>> overnight in Yosemite Valley\nDay 3: Drive to the High Country early and complete Clouds Rest or another hike?\nOr hike Four Mile-Panorama combo then drive to Lee Vining?\n>> overnight in Lee Vining\nDay 4: Hike Clouds Rest or hike another (or multiple) shorter High Country hikes\n(Cathedral Lakes, Gaylor Lakes, Elizabeth Lake , Lembert Dome and Dog Lake individually or in combination)\nDrive to Yosemite Bug\n>> overnight at Yosemite Bug\nDay 5: (departure) via Mariposa Grove (if open) and drive back to FAT\nHopefully PacificNorthwestFamily will be along soon to give you the benefit of her wisdom on all things Yosemite hiking.\n4 places mentioned in this post 1 Yosemite Falls Ranked #10 of 83 things to do in Yosemite National Park 1 704 Reviews 2 Glacier Point Ranked #1 of 83 things to do in Yosemite National Park 3 515 Reviews 3 Elizabeth Lake California, United States 4 Lembert Dome Ranked #25 of 83 things to do in Yosemite National Park 119 Reviews See all 4"}]
