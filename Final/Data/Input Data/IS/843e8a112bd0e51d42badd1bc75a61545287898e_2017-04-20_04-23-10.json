It was Spurs 12 th home league win on the spin, and 15 in all competitions. The place is a relative fortress. \nBournemouth didn\u2019t half make it easy though. Eddie Howe\u2019s side has not won a Premier League game away from home this side of the New Year festivities, and he must be concerned about the way his team have lacked desire once safe, particularly since they finished last season in the same way. \nHarry Kane returned to the starting lineup for the first time since injuring his ankle. It was a solid comeback scoring one and assisting for Son Heung-Min to score his 19 th goal of the season. Kane\u2019s delightful turn and finish was his 13 th goal in 13 games and 20 goals in the Premier League. He is only the third player behind Alan Shearer, Ruud van Nistelrooy, and Thierry Henry to score 20+ league goals three seasons on the tamp. Moussa Dembele and Vincent Janssen were also on the scoresheet. \nLast week , Spurs played earlier than Chelsea and won by 4-0, but Chelsea replied with a notable victory of their own. This week, Antonio Conte\u2019s side were in a similar spot, only you had a feeling that Man Utd at Old Trafford was going to be an entirely different proposition than playing Bournemouth. \nThere is nobody who knows Chelsea better than Jose Mourinho, and he used all of that experience to put one over Conte. Despite scoring 17 league goals this season, Mourinho relegated Zlatan Ibrahimovic to the substitute\u2019s bench preferring the lightning quick duo of Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard. \nThe two youngsters were a nightmare for the Chelsea backline, and it was Rashford who opened the scoring in the seventh minute after latching on to a superb through-ball from the industrious Ander Herrera, barely a minute after the future England star had another great opportunity to open the scoring. \nThe other crucial decision Jose Mourinho made was to do a man-marking job on Eden Hazard. Herrera was superb in the role and had the little Belgian on a leash all afternoon, and he still had time to seal the points for United with a deflected shot in the 49 th minute \u2013 his first Premier League goal of the season. \nIt was a big day for Spurs, but to highlight the gargantuan task ahead of them if they are to overtake the Blues, Chelsea is going to have to lose another two games in six, with Spurs going through the season unbeaten. \nHere is the run in and you have to say, Spurs have the tougher task with three London derbies, Man Utd in a Champions League race, and Hull desperate to escape relegation. Chelsea, on the other hand, has a tough trip to Everton, and that\u2019s about it. \nBut the pair face each other in the semi-final of the FA Cup at the weekend. If Spurs can beat Chelsea in that game then maybe the seeds of doubt planted at Old Trafford may begin to stretch towards the light? \nSpurs"}]
