I use those terms loosely as I imagine people will have their own opinions as to what category my buys/sells fall under.\nI would like to see if anyone would be willing to rate my first two months and tell me how I'm doing when it comes to strategy and profit. I'm obviously new to both \"trading\" and \"investing\" (notice the first sentence). My ask is that members of this community rate my progress on a scale of 1-100 and provide feedback on why they chose the rating. Please don't consider the scale of what I've bought/sold, but more the diversity and overall strategy.\nHere's what I have so far: \n20 Shares of TDS ($26.70 average per) 10 Shares of PBCT ($17.40 average per) 10 Shares of SSN ($0.57 average per) <- Not sure why I bought this 5 shares of T ($41.61 average per) 10 shares of F ($11.14 average per) My strategy right now is to buy and sell both JNUG and JDST as they rise and fall. Using the $25-$100 profit per trade, I purchase shares that I consider long term and attempt to diversify them. I primarily target shares with some sort of dividend to make up for any slips in the share price. Most of the time I'm buying both of JNUG/JDST in increments of 50-150 shares. I'm currently sitting at $1,447.63 with 10.51% profit.\nPretty basic and boring right? Well, let me know what you think\u2026.\nDisclaimer: I'm using a specific app to avoid trade fees, however this discussion isn't about that app (per the rules).\nSubmitted April 18, 2017 at 11:14PM by wyldbrian\nvia http://ift.tt/2or6Aj7 ", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "fd1a896b94bb8e83b1117e46af9175358ed7d0d3", "highlightText": "", "rating": null}]
