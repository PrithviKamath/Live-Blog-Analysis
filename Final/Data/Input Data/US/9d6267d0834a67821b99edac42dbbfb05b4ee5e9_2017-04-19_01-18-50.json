There\u2019s the cycle of life: Tony (Jim Broadbent) receives news of a death just as his daughter is about to give birth; then, in a deceptively amiable Werther\u2019s Original narration at the film\u2019s opening, Tony conjures up the image of life as a series of holding patterns, concentric circles that you navigate as you wait for the next stage to start.\nThis urge for closure \u2013 to loop back to a moment in the past \u2013 is a common theme in drama featuring older people. In the unexpected ingress to a lost moment of youth, and in the presence of Charlotte Rampling in a key role, the film evokes Andrew Haigh\u2019s masterly 45 Years . Both films plough similar terrain of regrets and buried secrets, both feature finely crafted performances by veteran actors.\nDirector Ritesh Batra\u2019s camera is particularly adept at capturing the subtle flags that indicate that people know each other a little too well: a flicker of something, part irritation, part amusement, that passes over the face of Margaret (Harriet Walter), Tony\u2019s ex-wife, when he delivers his restaurant order with the same cantankerous precision with which he approaches life.\nThis is involving storytelling, but ultimately the film is undermined by its own tasteful restraint. The holding pattern image is a fitting one \u2013 there is a sense here of a film that never quite touches down on a satisfying conclusion.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch a trailer for The Sense of an Ending.
