He still has a bit of growing to do but shouldn't be more than a medium-size dog. \nThe week of April 9-15 has been designated National Dog Bite Prevention Week, and the Alabama Veterinary Medical Association is encouraging all dog owners to be aware of the risks involved with dog bites. \n\u201cDog bites often happen during everyday activities among children and seniors,\u201d said ALVMA President Hal Pate, D.V.M. \u201cCertain situations can be more conducive to the risk of a dog bite. Protect your family and yourself by being familiar with preventive measures that will minimize the risk.\u201d \nEvery year, more than 4.5 million Americans are bitten by dogs, with more than half of all victims younger than age 14. Each year over 6,000 dog bites are reported in Alabama and many require emergency room visits, with some needing hospitalization. \nMost dog bites affecting young children occur during everyday activities and while interacting with familiar dogs. According to a study completed by State Farm and the Insurance Information Institute, dog bites accounted for more than one-third of all homeowners insurance liability claim dollars paid out in 2015, costing more than $570 million. This same year, more than 28,000 people underwent reconstructive surgery as a result of being bitten by dogs. \nDog owners should review these helpful tips below and always be aware of their surroundings when they are with their dogs. Taking precautions to ensure safety for all involved is the best way to reduce the risk for dog bite accidents. \nDog bite emergencies \nIf you are bitten, here is a checklist of things you should do: \n\u2022 If the dog\u2019s owner is present, request proof of rabies vaccination, and get the owner\u2019s name and contact information; \n\u2022 Clean the bite wound with soap and water as soon as possible; \n\u2022 Consult your doctor immediately or go to the emergency room if it\u2019s after office hours; and \n\u2022 Contact the dog\u2019s veterinarian to check vaccination records. \nProtecting your family \nBe cautious around strange dogs and treat your dog with respect. Because children are the most common victims of dog bites, parents and caregivers should: \n\u2022 Never leave a baby or small child alone with a dog; \n\u2022 Be alert for potentially dangerous situations; \n\u2022 Teach children \u2014 including toddlers \u2014 to be careful around pets; \n\u2022 Children must learn not to approach strange dogs or try to pet dogs through fences; and \n\u2022 Teach children to ask permission from the dog\u2019s owner before petting the dog. \nTips for owners \n\u2022 Carefully select your pet. Puppies should not be obtained on impulse; \n\u2022 Make sure your pet is socialized as a young puppy so it feels at ease around people and other animals; \n\u2022 Don\u2019t put your dog in a position where it feels threatened or teased; \n\u2022 Be calm. Always talk in a quiet voice or whisper \u2014 no shouting \u2014 and take a \u201ctime out\u201d if you feel angry or frustrated; \n\u2022 Train your dog. Basic commands help dogs understand what is expected of them and help build a bond of trust between pets and people; \n\u2022 Walk and exercise your dog regularly to keep it healthy and provide mental stimulation; \n\u2022 Avoid highly excitable games like wrestling or tug of war; \n\u2022 Use a leash in public to ensure you are able to control your dog; \n\u2022 Keep your dog healthy; \n\u2022 Have your dog vaccinated against rabies and other preventable infectious diseases; \n\u2022 Parasite control and other health care are important because how your dog feels affects how it behaves; \n\u2022 If you have a fenced yard, make sure your gates are secure; and \n\u2022 Neuter your pet. According to the National Canine Research Foundation, approximately 92 percent of fatal dog attacks involved male dogs, 94 percent of which were not neutered. Many veterinarians participate in Alabama\u2019s spay/neuter license plate program which offers low-cost spay/neuter services to those who qualify for assistance. This program is funded by the sale of spay/neuter license plates and also by designated funds submitted via a check off box on the Alabama income tax return.
