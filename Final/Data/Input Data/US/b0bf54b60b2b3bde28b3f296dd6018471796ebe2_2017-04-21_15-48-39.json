Andy Karl plays Phil Connors in \"Groundhog Day\" at the August Wilson Theatre in New York. (Joan Marcus) Charles McNulty (the composer and lyricist of the musical \u201cMatilda\u201d), is built around Karl as much as the 1993 Harold Ramis film was built around Bill Murray. Yet no one would confuse their characters.\nWhereas Murray\u2019s Phil was reflexively arrogant in a way that suggested he needed a strong antidepressant and some talk therapy, Karl is cocky in the handsome TV star mode. He\u2019s still hatefully seductive, but the charm of this egotistical frat boy has curdled with age. (In real estate terms, he\u2019d be a gorgeous fixer-upper with peeling wallpaper, mice in the walls and a rank garden.) \nA much-beloved modern fable with a sardonic twist, \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d has the narrative makings of a successful musical comedy. The tale is repetitive and made for the screen, but the moral is theatrically satisfying and the mix of jaundiced wisecracks and romantic feeling is perfect for today\u2019s Broadway.

The production by Matthew Warchus (artistic director of London\u2019s Old Vic, where the musical had its world premiere) finds clever theatrical solutions to deal with the inherently cinematic nature of the material. A car chase scene begins with actors crammed into a jokey stage vehicle and culminates in a drag race of toy cars. \nThe logistical trickery that manages to get Phil back into his room at the kitschy bed-and-breakfast for each new iteration of this never-ending day is astonishing. No matter how wild the preceding escapade, he still magically wakes up again in the same bed to the same radio news chatter about Punxsutawney Phil , the celebrity groundhog of this hick Pennsylvania town that Forecaster Phil has traveled to in an annual rite he openly scorns. \nThe fundamental problem with the show has to do with the monotony of musical storytelling. The first act has these numbers that are as tediously imprisoning as the situation Phil finds himself in. They\u2019re not so much songs as musical loops that reinforce what we already know about small-town Punxsutawney. \nMinchin can\u2019t figure out how to interest us musically or lyrically in the situation of a character who is meant to be shallow and disagreeable for the first half of the show. The musical numbers get better in the second half, but the most introspective songs are assigned to secondary characters, such as pesky insurance agent Ned Ryerson (John Sanders) and the lonely and misused town beauty, Nancy (Rebecca Faulkenberry). \nKarl, who is musically defined more by his bizarre circumstances than by his personality, gets a couple of rousing numbers in the second act as his character moves through arrogance and despair to humility and hope. But I found myself more drawn into Karl\u2019s predicament than to Phil\u2019s. A line from the darkly manic number \u201cHope\u201d \u2014 \u201cThere will be mornings you\u2019ll be utterly defeated by your laces\u201d \u2014 was delivered with a conspiratorial wink that elicited laughter and cheers from the opening night crowd. A number demanding a good deal of running was stylishly mimed to spare Karl\u2019s wonky knee. Barrett Doss as Rita and Andy Karl as Phil. Joan Marcus Barrett Doss as Rita and Andy Karl as Phil. Barrett Doss as Rita and Andy Karl as Phil. (Joan Marcus) \nBarrett Doss, who plays Rita Hanson, the associate producer on assignment with Phil, has a lovely singing voice that magnifies the character\u2019s emotional attractiveness. But this love match seems more theoretical than actual. Rita\u2019s goodness and Phil\u2019s eventual desire to improve his nature seem on paper like a good combination, but the actors don\u2019t have much chemistry. The emotional X-factor that connected Murray with Andie MacDowell in the movie is missing in the musical. \n\u201cGroundhog Day\u201d is ultimately a vehicle for Karl\u2019s virtuosity. Even moving gingerly, he has no problem anchoring this large-scale production. A sexy musical comedy screwball with a voice that can hold its own with Broadway\u2019s best, he found a show that fully exploits his unique combination of gifts. He has proved himself a trouper and deserves all the hip hip hoorays coming his way. But let\u2019s hope fate eventually frees him up for a more satisfying musical. \nSIGN UP for the free Essential Arts & Culture newsletter \u00bb Caption 'The Fate of the Furious' movie review by Justin Chang \nJustin Chang reviews \"The Fate of the Furious,\" directed by F.
