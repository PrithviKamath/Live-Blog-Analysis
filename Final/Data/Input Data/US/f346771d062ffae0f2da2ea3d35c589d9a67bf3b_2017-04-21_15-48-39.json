Most of the justices \u2013 including newly confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch \u2013 suggested during arguments that such recoveries are subject to a strict five-year statute of limitations. That could prevent the Securities and Exchange Commission from collecting huge amounts of money in many cases where the alleged fraud goes back years or decades before officials bring charges. The agency collected more than $4 billion in those so-called \u201cdisgorgement\u201d actions and other penalties in the 2016 fiscal year. The high court is deciding whether venture capitalist Charles Kokesh must return $35 million from investor funds he used to pay himself and others at his New Mexico-based operation from 1995 to 2006. The federal appeals court in Denver ruled that Kokesh must pay the full amount to the SEC. Lawyers for Kokesh say the five-year window should reduce his payment to just $5 million because the SEC did not bring charges against him until 2009. At issue is a law that prevents the government from going back more than five years to impose penalties or seek forfeiture of assets. The SEC argues the time limit doesn\u2019t apply because it\u2019s not assessing a penalty, only trying to recover illicit profits. But justices across ideological lines seemed skeptical of the distinction. \u201cIt does seem to me that we kind of have a special obligation to be concerned about how far back the government can go when it\u2019s something that Congress did not address,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said. Justice Elena Kagan said the SEC seemed to be using disgorgement both to compensate victims as well as to punish misconduct. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit artificial to try to tear them apart,\u201d she said. Kokesh\u2019s attorney Adam Unikowsky told the justices that if disgorgement is about both recovering assets and imposing a penalty, it has to be considered punitive overall and subject to the five-year limit. \u201cThe purpose of the remedy is to impose unpleasant legal consequences of wrongdoing,\u201d he said. Justice Department lawyer Elaine Goldenberg said it\u2019s not a punishment \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t take away anything that anyone was rightfully entitled to in the first place. It just remedies unjust enrichment.\u201d But Gorsuch noted that in a criminal case, the same kind of remedy would be considered a penalty. \u201cSo why does it make a difference that we just happen to be in the civil context,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, goodness gracious, the difference between civil and criminal has vexed this court for many years.\u201d The case comes to the high court from the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where Gorsuch served for more than a decade before he was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Gorsuch was not part of the three-judge panel that ruled against Kokesh last year. But he might find himself in the position of reversing his former colleagues if the high court sides with Kokesh. A ruling is expected by June.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:24:54.000+03:00"}]
