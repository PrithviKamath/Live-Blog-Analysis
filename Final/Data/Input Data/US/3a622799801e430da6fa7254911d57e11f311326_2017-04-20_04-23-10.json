missile strike on a military base in retaliation for the Syrian government\u2019s deadly chemical attack on civilians served as a strong, decisive message to bad actors worldwide, congressional Republicans say, and signified the new administration would hew closely to the traditional concept of American power. Kill Your Cable Bill! Just $2 a month \nIn interviews with The Daily Signal, Republicans of all stripes said they were OK that Trump did not consult Congress before he authorized the strike, in which 59 cruise missiles hit a Syrian air base early Friday morning local time. \nIt was the first U.S. military action against the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country\u2019s six years of civil war. \nBut as the Trump administration hints at a tougher approach to the Assad regime, Republican lawmakers say they expect to have a greater influence on future military action. \n\u201cWith this very positive action in Syria, the president has now brought to the forefront the need for a discussion between Congress and the administration about strategy going forward,\u201d said Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., a freshman lawmaker and Vietnam War veteran. \u201cThis event has become a catalyst for the next logical step that we have to have as a country. It\u2019s an opportunity for us as a country to show collaborative leadership within our system.\u201d \n>>> After Missile Attack, the Challenges Facing Trump in Syria \nBergman called for the Trump administration to propose an official Authorization for Use of Military Force for Congress to review. Rather than delineating a specific strategy, an AUMF\u2014as the authorization is known\u2014gives the basic legal authority for the U.S. military to use force against an enemy. \n\u201cCongress cannot be disengaged,\u201d Bergman told The Daily Signal in an interview. \u201cWe need to be involved in creating an AUMF of the future and understand this not a political game. This is about national security.\u201d \n\u201cCongress cannot be disengaged,\u201d says @RepJackBergman. \nHow Congress Can Authorize Force \nThe Trump administration, like its predecessor, is carrying out a military campaign against the Islamic State terrorist group, also known as ISIS, in multiple countries, including Syria. \nIt takes these actions under an existing AUMF from 2001 permitting the targeting of groups connected to the 9/11 attacks and the 2002 AUMF authorizing the Iraq War. \nPresident Barack Obama, in his second term, urged Congress to give him new authority to use force against ISIS, but there was bipartisan reluctance to do so and lawmakers never took a full vote on such an authorization. \nAfter the U.S. missile strikes last week, some lawmakers\u2014of both parties\u2014said Trump should seek congressional approval for an AUMF that specifically authorizes the U.S. military to fight Assad. \nSen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said it would not be appropriate to use the 2001 authorization, which was intended to fight al-Qaeda, because the Assad regime \u201cis certainly not connected to that group.\u201d \n\u201cIf you go back to the Federalist Papers, the Constitution is clear the commander in chief is the commander when the military is in the field, but Congress and the American people are responsible for calling out the military to move into battle\u2014whether it\u2019s through a war declaration or authorization for use of military force,\u201d Lankford, a member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said in an interview with The Daily Signal. \nRep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said she supported Trump\u2019s decision to strike the Syrian air base, but that Congress should consider any proposed future military action in Syria. \n\u201cIf the president intends to escalate the U.S. military\u2019s involvement in Syria, he must come to Congress for an Authorization for Use of Military Force which is tailored to meet the threat and prevent another open-ended war in the Middle East,\u201d Pelosi said in a prepared statement to reporters. . @SpeakerRyan , Congress must do its duty & come back into session at once to debate use of military force in Syria. https://t.co/hcxcyN9UUC pic.twitter.com/eJNO4D6Gor \n\u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) April 7, 2017 \nNeeded: \u2018Clear Plan to Win\u2019 \nSome Republican lawmakers interviewed by The Daily Signal were more nuanced in their views, saying they are prepared to wait for the Trump administration to first firm up a broader strategy for the Syrian conflict before proposing any future force. \n\u201cNo recent president in decades has ever needed to go to Congress for such a single strike occasion,\u201d Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the type of situation where the president is given authority under the Constitution to act. I do expect and feel confident the president will brief members of Congress when we return [from Easter recess], and I think we will be brought up to date on what the policy might be and future actions might be. We will have to wait and see if it scales to an all-out war.\u201d \nSo far, Trump\u2019s strategy is unclear. \nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump emphasized his focus in Syria would be on defeating ISIS, which maintains its base in that country. And in the early weeks of his administration, the White House articulated that facilitating the removal of Assad from power was not a priority. \nLast week, Trump\u2019s calculus seemed to change when the president said the chemical weapons attack had \u201ccrossed a lot of lines for me\u201d and that his attitude toward Syria and Assad \u201chas changed very much.\u201d \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer seemed to suggest Monday that Trump would act against Syria not just if it again used chemical weapons, but also when it used conventional munitions such as barrel bombs\u2014powerful explosive devices often filled with shrapnel. \nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights estimates the Syrian government dropped 12,958 barrel bombs in 2016, resulting in the deaths of 653 civilians. \n\u201cIf you gas a baby, if you put a barrel bomb into innocent people, I think you will see a response from this president,\u201d Spicer said in his daily briefing. \n\u2018Nothing Has Changed\u2019 \nSpicer walked back and clarified his comment later Monday. \n\u201cNothing has changed in our posture,\u201d Spicer said in a statement to reporters. \u201cThe president retains the option to act in Syria against the Assad regime whenever it is in the national interest, as was determined following that government\u2019s use of chemical weapons against its own citizens.\u201d \nOther Trump administration officials in recent days have sought to downplay the prospects for future military action against the Assad regime. \nDefense Secretary James Mattis, speaking to reporters Tuesday, said the administration\u2019s priority in Syria \u201cremains the defeat of ISIS.\u201d \n\u201cOur military policy in Syria has not changed,\u201d Mattis said. \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is meeting with Russian government officials this week, told reporters that the U.S. seeks a negotiated resolution to the Syrian civil war and wants Moscow\u2019s help in pushing Assad from power. \n\u201cThe final outcome does not provide a role for Assad or the Assad family in the future governance in Syria,\u201d Tillerson said in a Wednesday news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. \nTrump, in an interview on Fox Business that aired Wednesday morning, said simply: \u201cWe\u2019re not going into Syria.\u201d \nLater Wednesday, Trump called Assad \u201ca butcher\u201d and said U.S. relations with Russia could be at an \u201call-time low.\u201d \n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re not getting along with Russia at all\u2014we may be at an all-time low in terms of a relationship with Russia,\u201d Trump said during a news conference at the White House with Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO . \u201cThis has built for a long period of time, but we\u2019re going to see what happens.\u201d \nRep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Trump administration should clearly articulate its priorities in Syria to Congress. \n\u201cI am someone who believes strongly we should never send troops into harm\u2019s way unless we have a clear plan to win,\u201d Zeldin told The Daily Signal in an interview, adding: \nPart of executing a strategy to win includes getting everybody on the same page to what winning looks like. There is debate that will take place whether Assad should stay in power, and what role the U.S. should have in the region and around the world. While not every part of this debate should be televised for the adversary to see, at the same time there is a responsibility to ensure we are making the right decisions so that the American public is supportive of our efforts. \nLankford said the Trump administration ought to be focused both on defeating ISIS and helping to remove Assad, because the Syrian dictator\u2019s leadership fuels terrorism. \n\u201cWe hope Assad\u2019s status is resolved diplomatically, but you can\u2019t do diplomacy without a credible military threat behind it,\u201d the Oklahoma Republican said. #Syria Pres. Bashar al-Assad\u2019s brutality murders innocent people, creates regional chaos & contributes to the growth of ISIS. #Assad must go \n\u2014 Sen. James Lankford (@SenatorLankford) April 7, 2017 \nIf the Trump administration does not provide \u201ca clearly articulated vision\u201d for its strategy in Syria, Lankford said, \u201cCongress should not move forward on any action.\u201d \n\u201cNo one knows what the American policy is in Syria right now, and what it stands for and will not stand for,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cNone of our allied countries in the region will help in the fight unless they know where America stands. The Trump administration has to fix that or the international community will have no reason to engage.\u201d \nConstitution \u2018Pretty Clear\u2019 \nOther Republican lawmakers are more specific about what set of U.S. actions in Syria should require congressional oversight. \nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Congress should review any proposed \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in Syria dedicated to targeting the Assad regime. \n\u201cThe Constitution is pretty clear, you are gonna have a debate in the Congress,\u201d Jordan said in a speech Tuesday in his home district that was attended by a Daily Signal reporter. \u201cThat\u2019s the way the founders laid this thing out. If it\u2019s gonna escalate, if it\u2019s gonna be something with boots on the ground or anything like that, I think we\u2019ve got to be real careful about that, and it would warrant a full debate in the House and the Senate before we go any further.\u201d \nRep. Andy Harris, R-Md., also of the Freedom Caucus, said he expects the Trump administration to pursue a diplomatic solution to the Syrian civil war\u2014as Obama did. \nBut if Trump failed, and then sought military action against Assad, Congress should have a say, Harris said. \n\u201cIf further escalation involving serious military force is necessary, the president should consult with Congress first,\u201d Harris told The Daily Signal in an interview. \n\u201cIf further escalation involving serious military force is necessary, the president should consult with Congress first,\u201d says @RepAndyHarrisMD. \n\u201cFor instance, if the administration decides its diplomatic efforts weren\u2019t working and decided they needed to attack the Syrian air force, that is probably something they should obtain congressional approval for,\u201d Harris said. \nHe doesn\u2019t believe Trump would need Congress\u2019 blessing if the president sought to create no-fly and safe zones in Syria to protect civilians, the Maryland Republican added. \n\u2018Part of the Action\u2019 \nIn the interviews, the Republican lawmakers were not unified in describing how Congress should be incorporated into Trump\u2019s Syria plan. \nThe GOP lawmakers appear prepared to give the president some freedom now that he has shown himself not to be wedded to the isolationist foreign policy approach he espoused in the campaign. \n\u201cI think President Trump has a lot different view of the world than candidate Trump,\u201d Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., said in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cHe won\u2019t sit back and say, \u2018This is how I want the world to be\u2019 without regard for the facts of a given situation.\u201d \n\u201cThis president is an action guy,\u201d Kelly said, \u201cand I trust he will rely on the advice given by his military advisers. But Congress does need to be a part of the action. That\u2019s our responsibility constitutionally, and I would never walk away from that.\u201d \nPlease follow and like us: 0"}]
