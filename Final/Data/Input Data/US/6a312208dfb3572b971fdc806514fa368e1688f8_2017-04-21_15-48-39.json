Share Tease Of First Single \u201cLearn To Live\u201d, Reveal Lineup Apr 18th, 2017 - 11:59am 0 \nBad Wolves have confirmed their full lineup and shared a taste of their upcoming music video for their first single, \u201c Learn To Live \u201c, which will arrive on May 01st. Former DevilDriver drummer John Boecklin was the early driving force (no pun intended) behind the project, tracking their debut effort at Audio Hammer Studios with Mark Lewis ( Trivium , DevilDriver ). He said of the group: \n\u201cWe sound like a heavy-slightly prog rock band that tunes low and cuts off most of the fat. Watching Faith No More on the reunion tour made my thought process change. I was standing there, and it hit me that I don\u2019t want to be in a metal band with screaming all the time. We\u2019re heavy, yet from track-to-track, things change quite a bit.\u201d \nVocalist Tommy Vext added: \n\u201cMore was revealed, so more was required. The overall tonality and approach resonated with me as an opportunity to challenge myself and grow as a vocalist. I was given a platform to tap into some musical influences I hadn\u2019t yet explored in previous bands. All in all, it was some of the most diverse, original material I\u2019ve gotten to wrap my hands around.\u201d \nThe band\u2019s full lineup includes: \nVocals \u2013 Tommy Vext ( Westfield Massacre , ex- Divine Heresy , etc.) Guitars \u2013 Doc Coyle ( Vagus Nerve , ex- God Forbid ) Guitars \u2013 Chris Cain (ex- Bury Your Dead ) Bass \u2013 Kyle Konkiel ( VIMIC , ex- In This Moment ) Drums \u2013 John Boecklin (ex- DevilDriver )", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:24:55.000+03:00"}]
