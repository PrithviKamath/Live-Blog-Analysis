It is totally embarrassing, the extent of the lies being told to our public. There is no clear motive, there is no evidence of having the means at their disposal and there\u2019s been no real investigation. Exploitation of suffering children to invoke a traumatizing emotional response from the public, is absolutely repulsive and beyond evil. \nRussia has been very patient with all of this and thankfully, their leadership has a lot more sense and intelligence, than our supposed \u201cleadership\u201d in the west. I am grateful for Russia\u2019s patience. After the US attacked Syria, many expected Russia to retaliate in similar fashion, but when they didn\u2019t, many realized that Russia\u2019s leadership is much more responsible than the west has been led to believe. They have taken the moral high ground with everything the US has thrown at them. Put Dumpty in front of a war crimes tribunal and then send him to the gallows. wjabbe April 18, 2017 at 7:03 pm \nJust think of it: The U.S. today is the tyrannical, secret, lying propaganda, cheating international outlaw country of the world along with most of its so called allies, an almost perfect copy of the former Soviet Union we all once criticized and despised, while the new Russia today is the only shining star of truth and intelligence and sanity on the planet, a 180 degree reversal! Thank you Ambassador Shulgin; you seem to be the only sane, intelligent, honorable, honest person with integrity in the room. I am ashamed and deeply embarrassed at the criminals from Israel who have hijacked our once great nation and rendered it a virtual totalitarian lying secret dictatorship. Years ago I took Russian as a student at UC Berkeley. If I was younger I would consider reviewing it and joining you over there. It is only a matter of time now for America. Perhaps is has always been nothing but a lie all along. Clearly it can not survive under these circumstances and will collapse under its own foolishness and weight and financial demise. Nature has a way of dealing with countries who borrow and print too much money. Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta April 18, 2017 at 2:57 pm \nJWD & Co.: G7 foreign ministers recently met in Italy and refused to take action against Syria & Russia after the terrorists\u2019 gas attack on civilians in Syria\u2019s Idlib province \u2013 despite urging by UK FM/clown Boris. \nOf course, US orange buffoon Prez Twit had already taken \u2018action\u2019\u2013 as a favor to daughter/wife Ivanka. \nIn 2016 & 2017, President Tweet was lying. VT & others knew. Trump is lying now too. What difference? President Twit is now telling \u201cthe right lies\u201d\u2014 lies that NeoCons, NeoLibs and Bibi & Co. want to hear. \nTrump is losing his \u2018base\u2019\u2014 those who expected Trump to maintain his old lies and to keep unkeepable campaign promises. Fat chance. No way. Impossible. Something had to give\u2026 \nSo, Trump is now telling \u201cthe right lies\u201d\u2014 the lies that Bibi & Co. want to hear. Andrew_Bukanov(Russia) April 18, 2017 at 12:50 pm \nand the most terrible \u2013 is that they lie, lie,lie and never feel regret, even if the lie is revealed, \u2019cause it\u2019s a plan \u2013 a terrible plan that leads to the war. Someone\u2019s patience is not eternal. davor April 18, 2017 at 12:28 pm \nUS\u2019s UN lifelong travesty has finished. NATO can go and join now with the rest of the angelic Apocalypse riders. Criminal illegal aggression on Libya was indeed a ceremony of NATO\u2019s funeral. It seemed as a glorious victorious human rights mission at first, with zero casualties and signature \u201cobvious irrefutable\u201d casus belli, but NATO tied its hands permanently with it, as the main chaos generator worldwide. Nobody will come now to NATO\u2019s wake. darkplace123 April 18, 2017 at 9:47 am \nIf I had any power in the Russian military or government\u2026\u2026.I\u2019d just push the button now\u2026\u2026they are better men than me to put up with this constant myriad of Western lies and defamation of their country and motives\u2026\u2026.I\u2019m embarrassed to live in the west and breathe the air full of the stench of lies from all four corners Andrew_Bukanov(Russia) April 18, 2017 at 12:47 pm \nyes\u2026. and it is so embarrassing to meet the lie, to see it, to read it. The West go Mad.
