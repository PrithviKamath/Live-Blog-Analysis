Photo: Joshua Roberts/@Darth/Reuters Steve Bannon is a devout Catholic who believes in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. But it\u2019s the story of Christ\u2019s descent into hell that occupies his mind most this Easter weekend.\nThe embattled chief strategist to President Donald Trump is a student of Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich, a 19th-century nun and German mystic whose visions, documented in The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ , served as inspiration for The Passion of the Christ, the 2003 film by Mel Gibson (who, incidentally, Bannon once reportedly tried to work with on a movie about, among other things, Adolf Hitler and eugenics).\nIn that book, in a chapter favored by Bannon, this is how Emmerich describes hell: \u201cAll in this dreary abode tends to fill the mind with horror; not a word of comfort is heard or a consoling idea admitted; the one tremendous thought, that the justice of an all-powerful God inflicts on the damned nothing but what they have fully deserved, is the absorbing tremendous conviction which weighs down each heart.\u201d Those poor souls in hell are notable not for their misfortune, but for their deservedness. (Coincidentally, I\u2019m sure, Emmerich also predicts that Lucifer will be \u201cunchained for a time fifty or sixty years before the year of Christ 2000\u201d; Trump was born fifty-four years before, in 1946.)\nLikewise in the White House, where Bannon has endured a cinematic and enthusiastically documented fall in recent weeks, there is a sense that he made his own dismal fate. \u201cAll of his problems today are of his own making,\u201d one source with knowledge of the latest West Wing drama told me of Bannon. \u201cWhether Bannon is gone or not is an open question. Whether he\u2019s neutered? He\u2019s neutered. There was a time he had influence. His influence has waned.\u201d\nMedia reports have not been subtle in characterizing Bannon\u2019s political future. The New York Times branded him \u201c doomed \u201d while Politico planned his funeral (while also predicting a \u201crevenge saga\u201d). But as with all things Trump, the truth may be at once less and more predictable than that. \u201cYou\u2019re always up and down with Trump,\u201d another source said. \u201cThere\u2019s always gonna be a favorite.\u201d\nTrump is dissatisfied and looking to assign blame for a first 100 days in office defined by humiliation and defeat, according to half a dozen sources I\u2019ve spoken to in recent days. At any given moment, what irks him might be the death of the health-care bill, or the early misstep on the travel ban, or, perhaps most painfully of all, the old media chatter that Bannon is, in the words of Time , \u201cthe great manipulator.\u201d Trump attempted to dispel the latter perception last week in a remark to the New York Post, denying Bannon credit for the election victory against Hillary Clinton (\u201cI\u2019m my own strategist\u201d). \u201cThere was obviously residual lagging effects for all the press that Steve got,\u201d another source said. Trump mentioned to the Post an ominous threat to \u201cstraighten out\u201d tensions between Bannon and the presumably untouchable Jared Kushner. Bannon also might be paying the price for press Trump believes, accurately or not, Bannon engineered: \u201cHe thinks Steve was leaking against Jared and Ivanka,\u201d the source said. \u201cIf I was trying to fuck Steve? That\u2019s what I would do.\u201d\nWhite House sources tell me the ideological split with Kushner is real but not quite the point \u2014 Bannon\u2019s primary \u201c gunfight \u201d is with economic adviser Gary Cohn, a longtime Democrat whose influence has ballooned as Bannon has fallen out of favor with the president. The Goldman Sachs alums \u2014 Bannon was an investment banker there in the \u201980s, Cohn was the COO until earlier this year \u2014 can comfortably \u201cshoot the shit,\u201d but mutual suspicion looms beneath the superficial friendliness. \u201cLook, in all honesty? Steve has said things to me about Gary,\u201d a source close to Bannon told me. \u201cHe\u2019s never said one thing to me derogatory about Jared.\u201d\n\u201cThe president has started his love affair with Gary,\u201d another source said, \u201cGary\u2019s not aware of this: That love affair will end abruptly. Gary Cohn will step on a landmine.\u201d\nMany sources believe Bannon\u2019s \u201cfatal mistake\u201d was choosing to stay out of early, top-tier hiring disputes, focusing instead on his big picture, anti-globalist agenda. But now Bannon stands alone \u2014 a self-styled radical seated at the table with ideological opponents Kushner and Cohn, who haven\u2019t similarly been blamed for the turmoil of the first 100 days. Even White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, a natural ally to Bannon, has been working more closely with Kushner recently, a source said.\nAnother administration official close to Bannon added, \u201cHe\u2019s an intellectual messiah, right? There\u2019s a little bit of a messianic, I\u2019m gonna cure all the ills of the United States \u2014 him and Trump are like that together. But what I do think is he\u2019s realizing [that] he needs more allies.\u201d\nFor his part, Bannon appears to be abiding, if nervously \u2014 with the official divulging that he\u2019d been \u201crocked\u201d by his abrupt change in status with the president, and the uncertainty he now faces.\nTrump is, for instance, both prone to nostalgia \u2014 recently calling a former aide in the middle of the night to ask his advice on a Tweet \u2014 and also deeply unsentimental. \u201cYou could play golf with this guy for 40 years, have a heart attack on the ninth hole, he\u2019ll pick up a new golf partner on the tenth hole like nothing happened. He doesn\u2019t give a shit, okay? Doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t like you,\u201d the official said, adding, \u201cWhat happens with all these guys is they get very confident in their relationship with Trump and then Trump blasts them. As soon as you think you\u2019re in Trump\u2019s good graces and you start to be at ease and take that for granted, that\u2019s when you get annihilated.\u201d\nBut fittingly, given the holiday, in this week\u2019s carnage was a miracle of sorts for Bannon. The president, according to multiple sources, has been distracted at least a bit by the military strikes in Syria and Afghanistan as well as his needling of North Korea. \u201cHe\u2019s always been enamored of the generals,\u201d a source close to him said. \u201cThe more medals you\u2019re wearing on your chest, the more he likes you \u2014 that\u2019s a danger.\u201d For someone trying to keep a low profile in the White House, it might seem like welcome cover.\nTags: steve bannon politics donald trump trump administration early and often Steve Bannon\u2019s Biblical Fall Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Reagan Manipulated Television.
