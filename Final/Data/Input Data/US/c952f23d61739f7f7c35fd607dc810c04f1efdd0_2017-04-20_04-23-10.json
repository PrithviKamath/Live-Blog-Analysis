In my experience (admittedly, I've never used Airbnb in Bulgaria), that is most definitely not the case. If you are nervous about that, filter your search to look only for Superhosts (this can be done via the website, but not the app, for some reason)--you can't maintain your Superhost status if you cancel even one reservation.\nIf you find properties with no reviews, don't book them. I don't know if they are scams, but they are an unknown quantity, and why bother risking it? I would only book at places that had a significant number of recent (positive) reviews."}]
