(Photo: Gary A. Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports) 447 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Ryan Getzlaf scored the tiebreaking power-play goal with 4:46 to play on a bizarre deflection off Lance Bouma\u2019s skate, and the Anaheim Ducks beat the Calgary Flames 3-2 Saturday night to take a 2-0 lead in their first-round playoff series. \nGetzlaf\u2019s attempted pass across the high slot banked off Bouma\u2019s foot and somehow arched through the air and past Calgary\u2019s Brian Elliott for the Anaheim captain\u2019s second goal of the series. \nJakob Silfverberg and Rickard Rakell scored first-period goals and John Gibson made 35 saves in the Ducks\u2019 29th consecutive victory over the Flames at Honda Center since April 25, 2006, extending the longest such streak in NHL history. \nMikael Backlund scored a short-handed goal and Sean Monahan had a power-play goal for the Flames. \nGame 3 is Monday in Calgary. \nElliott stopped 26 shots for Calgary, which rallied from an early two-goal deficit and repeatedly threatened to take the lead before that heartbreaking bounce on Getzlaf\u2019s winner. \nThey still haven\u2019t won a regular-season game in Orange County since 2004, but the young Flames are headed back to Alberta with concrete knowledge they can play anywhere with the five-time Pacific Division champion Ducks. \nStill, the Anaheim crowd serenaded the Flames with its now-familiar chant: \u201cYou can\u2019t win here!\u201d \nPlaying without injured top defensemen Cam Fowler and Sami Vatanen, the Ducks survived a shaky second period with a strong third and more of their usual veteran poise. Anaheim hasn\u2019t lost in regulation in 16 consecutive games since March 10. \nSilfverberg and Rakell scored for the second straight game, following up their goals in Anaheim\u2019s 3-2 win in Game 1 with goals in the opening seven minutes of the rematch. \nThe Ducks started quickly again, with Silfverberg beating Elliott just 3:21 into Game 2 with his silky wrist shot. Silfverberg went goalless in Anaheim\u2019s seven-game loss to Nashville in the first round last season. \nRakell then doubled the lead when Getzlaf\u2019s pass took a funny bounce and allowed Rakell to wrap a shot underneath Elliott. \nAnaheim had a chance to seize control late in the first when Flames rookie Matthew Tkachuk took a double minor for high-sticking, but Backlund capitalized on a turnover and scored on a short-handed breakaway. \nThe Flames evened it in the second when Monahan cashed in a pass from Johnny Gaudreau for his second goal of the series. \nCalgary nearly went ahead moments later when the puck slipped underneath Gibson during a physical scrum in the crease, but video review confirmed the on-ice call of no goal, infuriating Flames coach Glen Gulutzan. \nNOTES: Vatanen was a late scratch with an upper-body injury after participating in the pregame skate. Korbinian Holzer made his NHL playoff debut at late notice. The German veteran hadn\u2019t played a postseason game since 2014 with the AHL\u2019s Toronto Marlies, and he hadn\u2019t played for Anaheim since April 4 after flying home late in the regular season for a personal matter. \u2026 Chad Johnson was Elliott\u2019s backup. He hadn\u2019t suited up since leaving the Flames\u2019 game at Anaheim on April 4 after just a few minutes with a lower-body injury. \u2026 Ducks F Nick Ritchie made his Stanley Cup playoff debut. The bruising power forward was suspended for the opener after punching Chicago\u2019s Michal Rozsival in Anaheim\u2019s penultimate regular-season game. Facebook Posted!
