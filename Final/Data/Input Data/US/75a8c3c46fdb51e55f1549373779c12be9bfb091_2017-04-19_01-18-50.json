He served as Minister for Horticulture in the following government before losing his seat in Dublin North in the 2011 election.\nHe now lives in Wexford where he works in organic horticulture.\nToday, current Greens leader Eamon Ryan said that he is \u0093thrilled\u0094 for his former colleague.\n\u0093As a friend and colleague, I\u0092m thrilled for Trevor,\u0094 he said this afternoon.\nI think it\u0092s a natural fit for him, it\u0092s not a surprise. I think it\u0092ll be great for him.\nRyan added that the party, whom Sargent continues to informally advise as a committed environmentalist, were aware of the direction he was taking.\n\u0093We knew of his interest in theology and the Church of Ireland of course,\u0094 he said.\nI think there\u0092s a connection there, between green politics and a certain kind of spirituality. It makes a lot of sense for Trevor, and I\u0092m thrilled for him. http://www.thejournal.ie/trevor-sarg...facebook_short", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg__thRcNZ4RaX239dQA4Is6aibn2e3f8VSe_MtuE2JuP6dfhasoUBXCtkrK1aoA068QOS3YmaBpmuDESde_HzZLq5FLsOyQw4I-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-15T06:17:00.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "", "thread": {"title_full": "The Greens say YES! - Peoples Republic Of Cork Discussion Forums", "site_full": "www.peoplesrepublicofcork.com", "site": "peoplesrepublicofcork.com", "site_section": "http://www.peoplesrepublicofcork.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=17", "performance_score": 0, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": null, "replies_count": 8, "site_categories": [], "country": "US", "section_title": "The Langers Forum - Peoples Republic Of Cork Discussion Forums", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg__thRcNZ4RaX239dQA4Is6aibn2e3f8VSe_MtuE2JuP6dfhasoUBXCtkrK1aoA068QOS3YmaBpmpOWTFU5aFrk", "published": "2007-06-14T00:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Greens say YES!", "uuid": "9859438d4af353ddbebbb91283e9239b4bff5934", "main_image": ""}, "uuid": "75a8c3c46fdb51e55f1549373779c12be9bfb091", "ord_in_thread": 7}]
