Jeff Sturges photo for the Sierra Vista Herald \nThe empty chair with \u201cReserved for Martha McSally\u201d sign, flag, and bottle of water for her. Jeff Sturges photo for the Herald/Review \nPercy Childs spoke about voter suppression \u2014 specifically, Interstate Crosscheck \u2014 which he said has resulted in one in six Hispanics and one in seven Asian-Americans, and one in nine African-Americans landing on the list to be expunged from the voting rolls. \nTwo things distinguished Thursday\u2019s town hall meeting in Sierra Vista from similar events being held around the country during the current two-week congressional recess. \nFirst, unlike other town halls, the crowd of more than 100 people was civil during brief statements by a series of presenters who highlighted concerns about education, ethics, the environment, health care and other national issues. \nSecondly, Congresswoman Martha McSally wasn\u2019t there. \n\u201cIn contacts we have made with her office, we were told that Martha has no plans for having any town halls in Cochise County,\u201d said Liz Lopez, a public school educator and moderator at Thursday\u2019s gathering. \nThat didn\u2019t stop presenters from addressing their questions to an empty chair \u2014 representing McSally \u2014 on points of concern. The two-hour event was sponsored by Indivisible Cochise County, which lists 169 members on its Facebook page, and was held at Sky Island Unitarian Universalist Church. \nMcSally held a town hall in Sahuarita in February. \nLopez said she would question why McSally voted in favor of Betsy DeVos as the Secretary of Education, noting that her appointment by President Donald Trump put the future of public education in jeopardy. Lopez said that it took years of extensive education and training to become and retain her position as a public school educator, while DeVos \u201c...has absolutely no education, training, or experience to qualify her for the position.\u201d \n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s agenda to privatize education has set us up to fail,\u201d Lopez said. \nShe was followed by Margaret Case, an attorney and Palominas resident, who said it\u2019s \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d that the president \u201c... has no ethics.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019ve become like a Third World country that is being run to the benefit of a single family,\u201d Case said. \nShe outlined a series of transactions between foreign governments and Trump businesses, including an event attended by the president at a newly-opened hotel in Washington, D.C. \n\u201cI would ask Martha McSally about all the ethical problems,\u201d Case said. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t seen the president\u2019s tax returns and she voted in favor of a bill that makes it so we may never see them.\u201d \nLocal environmental activist Tricia Gerrodette said she wanted to know where the congresswoman stood on clean air and water. Gerrodette urged McSally to join a bipartisan committee of lawmakers that is meeting regularly on Climate Change and what can be done to address the problem. \n\u201cShe has the right background. She\u2019s got a degree in biology and she would be perfect on that committee,\u201d Gerrodette said. \nKathy Garrett, a nurse, questioned whether McSally believed that health care is a privilege or a right. Garrett said people deserve the same coverage that elected representatives in Congress receive. \n\u201cWe know that the ACA [Affordable Care Act] will be changed,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cWhat we need to know is whether Martha will work to make sure the benefits that people need and want are retained. \n\u201cACA doesn\u2019t need to be replaced or repealed, it needs to be repaired.\u201d \nMargaret DeVries, a mother of two, questioned whether McSally would vote against transparency and allow the president to continue withholding his tax returns. DeVries urged everyone to participate in an upcoming march in Sierra Vista on Tax Day, Saturday, April 15. The march is scheduled to step off on Fry Boulevard, east of Coronado Drive, beginning at 3 p.m. \n\u201c(McSally) has chosen not to honor or engage her constituents,\u201d DeVries said. \nHereford resident Jo Ann Caruthers said building the border wall will destroy the habitat for numerous rare species of wildlife and will cost billions of dollars that are desperately needed for other programs and social services. \n\u201cHow will you vote?\u201d Caruthers asked. \u201cHow can you justify billions of dollars for this?\u201d \nPercy Childs, a retired U.S. Army combat veteran, who identified himself as a black man, said his concern is voter suppression. He pointed to voter identification laws being adopted across the country that have resulted in more than seven million people being denied a ballot, despite just 10 convictions of people attempting voter fraud. \nBefore a brief recess, Lopez asked people to raise the signs they brought to the meeting. About 20 signs with various messages on national issues were held up by the audience.
