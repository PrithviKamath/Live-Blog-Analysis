New York is insanely competitive, with a ton of turnover and a very demanding audience. A fast casual restaurant in Shaker Heights can coast for a long time, because\u2026 it\u2019s better than the alternatives.\nThanks to marketing, the media and our culture, we spend a lot of our time comparing before we decide whether or not we\u2019re happy.\nTurn back the clock just 60 years. If you lived in 1957, how would your life compare to the one you live right now? Well, you have access to lifesaving medicines, often in pill form. You can choose from an infinite amount of entertainment, you can connect with humans all over the Earth, for free, at the click of a button. You have access to the sum total of human knowledge. You have control over your reproductive cycle. You can eat sushi (you\u2019ve even heard of sushi). You can express yourself in a thousand ways that were forbidden then\u2026\nThat\u2019s in one lifetime.\nBut we don\u2019t compare our lives to this imaginary juxtaposition. Instead, we hear two things from the media we choose to engage with: Other people have it better, way better. And, it\u2019s going to get worse. Add to that the idea that marketers want us to believe that what we have now isn\u2019t that good, but if we merely choose to go into a bit of debt, we can buy our way to a better outcome\u2026\nComparison leads to frustration which sometimes leads to innovation.\nMore often than not, though, frustration doesn\u2019t make us happy. It only makes us frustrated.\nIf a comparison isn\u2019t helping you get to where you\u2019re going, it\u2019s okay to ignore it.\n\n             from Seth Godin\u2019s Blog on marketing, tribes and respect http://ift.tt/2p9fIxK "}]
