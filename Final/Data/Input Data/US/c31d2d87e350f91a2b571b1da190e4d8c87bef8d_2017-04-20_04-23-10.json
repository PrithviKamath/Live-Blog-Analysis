I have developed the tendency when grabbing a lens for the day to grab the most un-coated one I have. I don't know whether it is because the coatings are detracting from the image or whether the older lens are simply better or maybe I am a bit of a Luddite and like old stuff. I suspect it is the coating because my 28mm of choice is a Takumar Bayonet 28mm 2.8 which I put ahead of both my M28 3.5s and equal to better than my A 28mm. Once more an uncoated lens. Unfortunately with the reviews you can't really tell if coating is making a difference to people.\nI agree that it's the coatings. My uncoated 1947 Kodak Anastigmat 50mm/3.5 that I've converted to K mount gives me the most perfect colour rendering of all the lenses I own. I'm at a point now where I would choose completely clear uncoated glass every time, if I only had the choice."}]
