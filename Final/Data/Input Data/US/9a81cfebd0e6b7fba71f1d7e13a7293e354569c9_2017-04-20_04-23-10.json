Sample variation would be greater.\nBefore I had any of these presets I did a comparative test in my range which was M down to Sup Tak.\nThe sub tak came out noticeably ahead wide open and a big of enough difference to matter.\nI suspect that is the change from 5 element to 4.\nGiven that the reviews are a highly subjective discussion on the lens I just feel that the 46 mm lens reflect a specific era and their universal lack of coating is another point of difference.\nThe trouble is in the reviews not enough people go to the trouble of specifying which one their lens is. I have developed the tendency when grabbing a lens for the day to grab the most un-coated one I have.\nI don't know whether it is because the coatings are detracting from the image or whether the older lens are simply better or maybe I am a bit of a Luddite and like old stuff.\nI suspect it is the coating because my 28mm of choice is a Takumar Bayonet 28mm 2.8 which I put ahead of both my M28 3.5s and equal to better than my A 28mm. Once more an uncoated lens.\nUnfortunately with the reviews you can't really tell if coating is making a difference to people."}]
