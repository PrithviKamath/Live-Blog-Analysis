(Associated Press) \nTOKYO - The United States did not need to respond to North Korea\u2019s latest missile launch because it was a failure, the White House said Sunday, as Vice President Mike Pence arrived in Seoul on the first leg of a four-country trip to Asia. \nAs Pence was departing from Alaska - a day after a huge military parade in Pyongyang - North Korea launched a ballistic missile that exploded within a few seconds. \nSee Also \nNorth Korea had been expected to do something provocative to mark the most important day on the regime\u2019s calendar, the April 15 anniversary of founder Kim Il Sung\u2019s birthday. \nTensions in the region had been running high amid expectations of a nuclear test or a missile launch, with President Trump vowing to \u201cproperly deal with\u201d North Korea if China would not. \nBut a White House foreign policy adviser traveling with Pence said that the United States did not need to take action \u201cto reinforce their failure.\u201d North Korea has fired numerous medium-range missiles, as Sunday\u2019s appeared to be, so one more made little difference. \n\u201cIf it had been a nuclear test, then other actions would have been taken from the U.S.,\u201d the adviser told reporters on the vice president\u2019s plane. \nSome analysts were puzzled by this. \n\u201cI\u2019m not sure why failed missile tests, which are still banned by the U.N. Security Council, are considered less provocative,\u201d said Kent Boydston, a North Korea-focused research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThe North Koreans know they may fail, but they improve their capabilities each time.\u201d \nIndeed, while the latest missile exploded soon after launch, experts say North Korea is able to learn from its mistakes and hone its technology. It had repeated failures with other missiles, including the medium-range Musudan and a submarine-launched ballistic missile, before successfully firing both. \nPence made a surprise visit to the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea on Monday, one day after Kim\u2019s regime launched the missile. \nNorth Korea\u2019s behavior will be the focus of Pence\u2019s trip to Asia, with a senior administration official saying the vice president would be discussing \u201cthe belligerency of North Korea\u201d at every stop. \nAfter stopping in Seoul, Pence is to travel to Tokyo; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Sydney. \nNorth Korea\u2019s missiles are a particularly complicated issue in South Korea. \nThe conservative government of former president Park Geun-hye, who was removed from office last month after her impeachment in December, had agreed to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, antimissile system to defend against North Korea\u2019s rockets. \nSouth Korea made this decision last July after much equivocation. China strongly objects to the THAAD battery - in particular its radar system, which Beijing worries will be used to peer into China. \nBeijing has made its unhappiness known with a wide economic boycott that includes K-pop concerts, toilet-seat imports and tour group travel to South Korea. \nNow, South Korea is heading toward a snap presidential election May 9 to replace Park, and the THAAD system is a core issue. \nMoon Jae-in, the progressive candidate who had been leading in the polls, has promised to review the previous government\u2019s decision to host THAAD. Apparently sensing a worsening political environment, the U.S. military sped up the deployment to try to get everything in place before the election. \nBut now Moon faces a strong challenge from a more centrist candidate, Ahn Cheol-soo, who has said that he will respect the Park administration\u2019s agreement with the United States. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a critical point for the defense of South Korea in recognizing it\u2019s not an offensive weapon. It\u2019s there to prevent rockets slamming from the North Koreans,\u201d an American official said while previewing Pence\u2019s trip. \nThe complicating factor here is China. It wants the missile battery gone, and the United States wants China to crack down on North Korea. Although Trump had a cordial summit with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Florida this month, the North Korea issue threatens to drive a wedge between them. \nChina on Friday warned that \u201cstorm clouds\u201d were gathering. \nForeign Minister Wang Yi urged the United States and North Korea not to push their recriminations to a point of no return and allow war to break out on the peninsula. \nOn Sunday, China\u2019s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, spoke to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by telephone, and the two \u201cexchanged views on the current situation on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. \nChina said it cut off coal imports from North Korea in February, in accordance with U.N. Security Council sanctions. \nThe Global Times, an English-language Chinese newspaper that does not necessarily reflect official policy, recommended that Beijing convey a clear message to Pyongyang: that if it conducts a sixth nuclear test, the Chinese government would support stiffer U.N. sanctions to cut off \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of its oil supplies to North Korea. \nThe U.S. Navy sent a strike group to Korean waters last week, but defense officials have said tougher sanctions and pressure was still the favored approach to dealing with North Korea. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a range of options, both militarily, diplomatic and others \u2026 at disposal for the president should he choose to use them,\u201d the White House foreign policy adviser told reporters on Air Force Two. \u201cBut for this particular case [of the failed missile launch] \u2026 we don\u2019t need to expend any resources against that.\u201d \nTensions are expected to continue for several weeks at least. \nLarge-scale annual exercises between the South Korean and U.S. militaries will continue until the end of April, and North Korea will mark another important date - the anniversary of the foundation of the Korean People\u2019s Army - on April 25. \nRead/post comments "}]
