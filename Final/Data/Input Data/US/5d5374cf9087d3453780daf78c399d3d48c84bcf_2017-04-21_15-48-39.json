Like the stock market, the deadline for Trump Today action is 4 p.m. Eastern time, even as we acknowledge that substantive news can and does occur after hours.\nPresident Donald Trump called out the Democrat in Georgia\u2019s special election on Tuesday, signed a \u201cbuy American, hire American\u201d executive order during a visit to Wisconsin and threatened to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement if major changes aren\u2019t made to it.\nAIMING AT OSSOFF\n\u2022 Trump again inserted himself into the special election in Georgia, this time calling out by name Jon Ossoff, the Democrat expected to lead voting in Tuesday\u2019s contest. If rivals keep the former congressional staffer from winning below 50% of the vote, there would be a runoff on June 20 between the top two finishers. That would likely make for a tougher challenge for Ossoff. Trump tweeted twice Tuesday morning, saying the Democrat would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d in Congress and urging Republicans to vote. Ossoff has said Trump is \u201cmisinformed\u201d about his plans.\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff would be a disaster in Congress.
