Professor values are currently one of the most prevalent forms of liberal indoctrination. Andrew Breitbart , the founder of the conservative news site Breitbart News Network , at one point intended to create a category \"Big Education\" in order to expose professor values, but he died before he could implement it. \nAn extremely high percentage of professors disagree with conservative principles, but very few replace them with the discredited philosophy of postmodernism . [1] Professors' common value system typically includes atheism , anti-Christian politics , censorship , socialism , unjustified claims of expertise and knowledge (for example, the dogmatic promotion of the theory of evolution [2] ), liberal beliefs, liberal grading , liberal bias , [3] historical revisionism , anti-patriotism, anti-Americanism , lack of productivity, bullying or discouraging conservative students (for example, homeschoolers), [4] and promotion of sexual immorality. [5] \nSuch attitudes are also shared by educators in the public education system from grade school through high school, and even by members of public school boards who take an elitist attitude toward parents of the children being indoctrinated with those same beliefs by liberal educators. [6] [7] [8] These same educators, knowing that what they are doing is wrong, go out of their way to deliberately hide the truth from their students' parents, who they know would not support what they do in the classrooms and would call for the resignation or firing of the offending teachers and school board officials who support them; to that end, liberal elitist school boards stand up for the teachers and the professor values they support by ignoring parents' complaints, denying any wrongdoing to them, attempting (by means of deceit and disinformation ) to discredit any information on educator wrongdoing uncovered by parents, [9] blocking their inquiries and even resorting to intimidation and making criminal threats against them (and later denying making such threats when publicly called out on them afterward) [10] in an attempt to silence parental opposition to what are clearly illegal actions against underaged students. \nAn excellent example of academics going beyond their expertise is the example of the cryonics movement. Cryonics is a pseudoscience that tries to extend life or achieve immortality in a non-theistic way after a person is legally dead (Cryonic procedures are performed shortly after a person's death). [11] Robert Ettinger was an atheist and American academic who some consider to be \"the father of cryonics\" because of the impact of his 1962 book The Prospect of Immortality . [12] Isaac Asimov was a popular American science fiction writer and a professor of biochemistry at Boston University . He was also an atheist. [13] According to The Cryonics Society, Asimov said of cryonics, \"Though no one can quantify the probability of cryonics working, I estimate it is at least 90%...\" [14] See: Atheism and cryonics \nIn a Zogby poll, 58% of Americans said that the bias of professors is a serious problem, while 39% said it is a \"very serious\" problem. [15] The survey demonstrated further that \"an overwhelming majority also believe that job security for college professors leaves them less motivated to do a good job than those professors who do not enjoy a tenured status\u201465% said they believe non-tenured professors are more motivated to do a good job in the classroom.\" [15] One study in 2008 found that \" Texas university professors overwhelmingly favor Democratic candidates in their campaign contributions.\" [16] \nProfessors rarely engage in wrongdoing while completing research. \"About 1,000 potential incidents of fabrication, falsification or plagiarism in scientific research go unreported every year, according to a survey that suggests such misconduct is far more prevalent than suspected....[A]bout 22 percent was by a professor or senior scientist.\" [17] \u201c There is no place on earth so close-minded as the modern University. The lack of diversity of thought is unmatched anywhere on earth. [18] \u201d 12 References Free speech \nDuring the McCarthy era, academia prided itself on resisting attempts to restrict the rights of professors to advocate for Communism or other positions unpopular with the general public. However, in the 21st Century, faculty is not allowed to make statements that could be viewed as potentially making some students uncomfortable. So, minority students hold faculty into account for \"microaggressions\" or the failure to make \"trigger warnings\" if course material deals with topics that some students may find offensive. Universities and their staffs are expected to create \"safe spaces\" where minority students can exchange their pre-conceived notions about issues without being exposed to contrary viewpoints. These politically correct imparatives take priority over any concern for freedom of speech and/or academic freedom. Campuses create \u201csafe spaces\u201d where students can shelter from discombobulating thoughts and receive spiritual balm for the trauma of microaggressions. [1] \nFor example, at the University of Virginia , Douglas Muir, an executive lecturer in the Engineering School and the Darden Business School, had used his personal Facebook account to respond to a post about a lecture given by the founder of Black Lives Matter . He wrote, \"Black lives matter is the biggest racist group since the clan. Are you kidding me. Disgusting!!!\" [19] The BLM students protested, and the Dean at first issued a statement saying that Muir's views do not represent the University and later announced that Muir was asked to take a leave of absence. After the leave of absence was announced, the local NAACP still asked that Muir be fired. \nAt Cornell University , historically white fraternities (which are not allowed to discriminate based on race or religion) are suspended for even minor violations involving underage drinking. However, when Omega Psi Phi, a historically black fraternity, held a party that ended in a fatal knife fight, no disciplinary action was taken against the fraternity or individuals. Also at Cornell, which has never been racially segregated and was not built with slave labor, black student activists have demanded that the \"Cornell Plantations\" a garden that has held that name since its founding more than a century ago, be renamed because the word \"Plantations\" evokes associations with pre-Civil War slavery. \nIn contrast, at the start of the fall 2016 semester, the University of Chicago sent a letter to incoming students denouncing political correctness and \"trigger warnings.\" The letter stated, \"You will find that we expect members of our community to be engaged in rigorous debate, discussion, and even disagreement. At times this may challenge you and even cause discomfort.\" [20] The American Association of University Professors issued a policy statement against trigger warnings in August 2014. It states in part: \u201c Some discomfort is inevitable in classrooms if the goal is to expose students to new ideas, have them question beliefs they have taken for granted, grapple with ethical problems they have never considered, and, more generally, expand their horizons so as to become informed and responsible democratic citizens. Trigger warnings suggest that classrooms should offer protection and comfort rather than an intellectually challenging education. They reduce students to vulnerable victims rather than full participants in the intellectual process of education. The effect is to stifle thought on the part of both teachers and students who fear to raise questions that might make others \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d [21] \u201d See also: Academia and intellectual development \nPresently, there appears to be a higher education bubble that will burst. [22] In addition, college is clearly not delivering the goods in terms of intellectual development for a large percentage of its students. An American study found that forty-five percent of students achieved no significant improvement in their critical thinking, reasoning or writing skills during their first two years of college. After four years, 36 percent displayed no significant increases in these so-called \"higher order\" thinking skills. [23] Students, particularly those who made poor curriculum choices, are increasingly angry that college does not adequately prepare them for the marketplace and leaves them with a pile of debt. [24] Politicizing hiring \nIn 2013, a study found that academia was less likely to hire evangelical Christians due to discriminatory attitudes. [25] See also: Atheism and intolerance \nFaculty boards have been known to (on multiple occasions) block the granting of a tenured professorship to candidates for tenure who: profess a Christian faith (see: Atheism and academia ) endorse the mere investigation of Intelligent Design \nFor example, professors at Washington University wore white armbands to protest an award of an honorary degree to Phyllis Schlafly , a noted conservative , in an act of political partisanship and utter unprofessionalism. [27] At the University of Chicago , more than one hundred professors signed a letter to protest a proposal to honor conservative-leaning Nobel Prize -winning colleague Milton Friedman . [28] \nPoliticians are routinely given high-ranking academic positions. Examples include: William M. Bulger (brother of the noted organized crime figure and fugitive Whitey Bulger ) [35] Crimes and alleged crimes by professors and former professors University of Florida professor Don Samuelson was arrested for using a camera pen to secretly film under the skirts of two students. [36] Head of Millikin University\u2019s psychology department, professor James St. James, killed his entire family as a teenager. [37] ( Main articles: University of Alabama shootings and Amy Bishop ) A University of Alabama biology professor, Amy Bishop , was arrested for shooting three fellow faculty members after being denied tenure.

He is accused of intercepting e-mails and instant messages on a computer used by the woman in May 2007. [45] \" Vanderbilt University professor James J. Lang was arrested [on a] Friday evening in Fairview on a charge of receipt of child pornography.\" [46] Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor Jeffrey Hunker, 51, \"was charged with drunken driving three times in eight days\" in August 2008, and, as a result, prosecutors asked the judge to imprison him. He had worked in the Clinton Administration and was driving his new BMW when stopped for the third time. [47] University of Iowa political science professor \"Arthur H. Miller, 66, [was] accused of demanding sexual favors from students in exchange for better grades .... He was arrested on four counts of bribery, a class C felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison ....\" [48] After being released without bail, Miller then disappeared and police wasted thousands of dollars looking for him. [49] Later his body was found in a park. \"He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\" [50] Arkansas Tech University chemistry professor Albert Snow, 33 years old, was sentenced to 10 years in jail \"on a charge he stalked a person he believed was a teenage girl on the Internet ... Snow was arrested in January 2007 after showing up at a Russellville apartment complex where police say he expected to meet a 15-year-old girl.\" [51] At Northern Kentucky University, language and literature professor Sally Jacobsen incited some of her students to vandalize a pro-life display by Northern Right to Life, the campus pro-life group. Jacobsen herself also participated in the vandalism, which involved destroying rows of white crosses symbolizing the graves of aborted children. Jacobsen justified the vandalism as free speech, stating, \"I did, outside of class during the break, invite students to express their freedom-of-speech rights to destroy the display if they wished to.\" Jacobsen was unrepentant until given the choice of facing criminal charges of theft, criminal mischief and criminal solicitation or apologizing. She chose the latter and also paid Northern Right to Life for damage to the display. Jacobsen was suspended by the university and subsequently retired. [52] College of New Jersey adjunct professor of engineering Bruce R. McKenna, 43, \"surrendered to authorities after allegedly having sexually explicit conversations with an undercover officer posing as a teenage girl.\" He was \"charged with six counts of attempting to endanger the welfare of a child, six counts of attempted sexual contact, sexual assault and attempted luring. ... Before McKenna was arrested, the situation escalated to the point where the professor was allegedly trying to meet with a 13-year-old girl.\" [53] A South Korean court sentenced a former university art professor to 18 months in jail for forging her US degree certificates, officials said.

Ritter was arrested on March 21, 2008, and charged with selling marijuana to undercover police officers, and a subsequent search of his home uncovered 19 bags of marijuana. [55] Kansas State University English professor Thomas Murray was a popular teacher, but he was convicted of murdering his ex-wife with 17 stab wounds and blunt trauma to her head. She \"was found dead in her bedroom atop a dresser.\" [56] Professor Murray had written several books, including \"The Language of Sadomasochism.\" [56] He did not testify in his defense and spoke only at sentencing, where he called the state's case a \"fairy tale.\" [57] Shortly after the end of the school year and his contract, Marshall University Psychiatry associate professor John M. Adams burglarized and murdered Bobby Burns on July 2, 2003, and then kidnapped two women and forced them to drive him across the Ohio River . [58] University of South Florida professor Sami al-Arian pled guilty to \"aiding a terrorist group\" and was \"sentenced to 57 months in prison.\" [59] He then \"spent more than a year in civil contempt after refusing to appear before two grand juries investigating Islamic charities in Northern Virginia.\" [60] Claremont McKenna College visiting professor Kerri Dunn was sentenced to a year in state prison after she was found guilty of staging a phony hate crime , in which she \"spray-painted her car with racist and anti-Semitic slurs and then reported a hate crime on campus.\" [61] University of Hawaii professor Marc Fossorier was arrested and later convicted and sentenced to one year in jail for attempting a sex crime with a girl apparently only 15 years old.

Zamudio-Taylor resigned after being charged with viewing child-pornography in a campus computer laboratory. [65] Concordia University professor Valery Fabrikant shot and killed four other professors in 1992. [66] A British university professor was jailed for ten months when convicted of plotting to defraud a hospital trust. [67] French Marxist structuralist philosopher Professor Louis Althusser (1918-1990) killed his wife in 1980 and was afterwards confined to a psychiatric hospital. Professor Daniel Storm, of the University of Washington , flushed 4 liters of the flammable solvent ethyl ether down the sink, rather than pay the safe disposal fees. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jim Oesterle said that his using an axe to open the containers was particularly dangerous because a spark could easily have ignited the ether. [68] An Associate Professor at Youngstown State University was locked up and fined $50 after baring his buttocks in front of children at a county fair. [69] Philosophy professor Abimael Guzman of the National University of San Cristobal de Huamanga in Peru founded the bloodthirsty Shining Path organization, one of the most violent terrorist groups of recent decades. A childcare lecturer at Athlone Institute of Technology, Ireland , was convicted of sexual assault while on a trip to Amsterdam .

[75] Simone de Beauvoir , in 1943, was charged with abducting Nathalie Sorokine, a minor and one of her best students, by Nathalie's parents. Although her abducting a minor would have resulted in a jail sentence, mutual friends of Beauvoir intervened and she was acquitted, although she nonetheless had her teaching license revoked and was banned from ever teaching again within France 's borders. [76] Michel Foucault , during the January 1969 Student Protests at the University of Vincennes in France, proceeded to \"gleefully\" throw stones at the police trying to control the riot . He was also one of the few faculty members to participate actively in the protests alongside the students. [77] Walter Hendrik Gustav Lewin , astrophysicist, retired Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, and producer of the most popular physics video lectures on MIT OpenCourseWare . There is some controversy about these videos because a 32-year-old French married woman, Fa\u00efza Harbi, suffering from psychological disorders watched some of them and was pressured by Lewin to send him some naked selfies. [78] MIT apparently had some concerns that this caused a Title IX violation, and cut ties with Lewin and the videos. Immoral, unethical, or bizarre behavior James Boster, a professor of anthropology at the University of Connecticut , became unhinged and angrily shouted at a campus, open-air, Christian preacher in a crude and ignorant rant (See Video [79] ). The incident was so embarrassing for the university that they felt compelled to denounce Boster's behavior. [80] Thirty-two hundred educators, most of them professors , signed a letter supporting unrepentant domestic terrorist and fellow professor William Ayers ( a protege of Obama ). They claimed Ayers' bombing of the Pentagon and other government buildings, his direct involvement in at least three deaths, were just \"history.\" Notable signers included Professor Rashid Khalidi (No. 5), known for his call to destroy Israel , and the above-mentioned Ward Churchill (No. 814). George Leef, director of research for the John William Pope Center for Higher Education Policy, Raleigh , North Carolina, said, \"History should be important to teachers.\" [81] American history professor at the Massachusetts College of Art, Noel Ignatiev says, \u201cIf you are a white male, you don\u2019t deserve to live....\" [82] Associate Professor David Guth of the University of Kansas journalism school says that NRA family members' children should die in the next mass shooting as divine retribution.

Also, he sought sexual relationships with porn actors and actresses who were invited to speak to his class. [84] April 2011, University of Iowa professor Ellen Lewin who studies same-sex relationships was upset by an email from a campus Republican group. She hit reply-all on her email with the comment \"F--- you, Republicans.\" [85] In 2009, Central Connecticut State University student John Wahlberg gave an in-class presentation on gun control , pointing out that if students were permitted to carry concealed weapons on campus, school shootings could be more easily stopped. Wahlberg's professor, Paula Anderson, complained to campus police, who interrogated him about the location of all his firearms . [86] Arthur Butz, professor of electrical engineering at Northwestern University , is a prominent Holocaust denier . His most infamous book is The Hoax of the Twentieth Century , one of the first major works of Holocaust denial written in English. [87] A Texas Southern University professor was investigated for allegedly plagiarizing his grant proposal. [88] The President of the University of Texas-Pan American is under investigation after allegations that she plagiarized her 1974 dissertation. [89] An Iowa community college president resigned after publication of a photo that appeared to show him pouring beer into a young woman's mouth. But the school 's board of trustees approved a severance package that officials said was valued at about $400,000 plus benefits. [90] A Kansas university professor, Fort Hays State University debate coach William Shanahan, came \"under fire after a video showing him mooning a room full of students and faculty during a heated debate found its way onto YouTube.\" He \"is shown on the video in a profane, in-your-face argument with his counterpart from the University of Pittsburgh ....\" [91] Emory University History Professor of History Michael Bellesiles , a gun control advocate, wrote a book entitled Arming America, The Origins of a National Gun Culture (2000). Gary Wills gave it a glowing review in The New York Times , but admitted later that \"I was took. The book is a fraud.\" [92] Bellesiles resigned from his position as Professor of History when an independent committee of scholars examined his work and concluded that \"his scholarly integrity is seriously in question.\" [93] According to one columnist, 88 Duke University professors\u2014more than 10 percent of the Duke professorial faculty\u2014endorsed and published an advertisement hurtful to the 3 students who had been wrongly accused of rape during a lacrosse team party , which \"helped create the lynch-mob atmosphere.\" [94] When student Rebecca Beach circulated an email at Warren Community College in New Jersey disclosing that decorated Iraq war hero Lt. Col. Scott Rutter would be visiting, English professor John Daly replied: \"Real freedom will come when soldiers in Iraq turn their guns on their superiors.\" Young America's Foundation later placed Beech on Fox News 's Hannity and Colmes to expose this and other intolerant e-mail. The resulting outrage ultimately forced Daly to resign and for the president to issue an apology, stating that faculty would now be required to undergo free speech sensitivity training from now on. [95] Ward Churchill was fired from the University of Colorado for fabricating his research and for plagiarizing the work of others. He had falsely claimed to be of Native American descent in applying for the post. Previously, he had infamously insulted the victims of 9/11 as 'Little Eichmanns .' [96] Richard Lenski of Michigan State University was rude and demeaning when replying to a member of the public who asked about his research. When challenged to provide data, professors who push evolutionism on the public evade the question. [97] Madonna Constantine, a New York City Columbia University professor claimed she was the victim of racism in the fall of 2007 when a noose was found on her office door. She was later fired for plagiarizing the work of other professors and even her own students. [98] Vulgar and viciously bigoted anti-religion (mainly Christianity ) University of Minnesota Morris professor and blogger PZ Myers infamously raised the hackles of Catholics by stating his desire to desecrate a Holy Communion wafer (viewed by Catholics as the Body of Christ). [99] The resultant outcry from Catholics resulted in the university removing all links to Myers' blog from their website. [100] Myers has also stated that he is looking forward to the death of George W. Bush so he can travel to Texas and urinate on Bush's grave. [101] Professors engage in grade inflation , giving their students artificially high grades\u2014whether they deserve them or not. In addition, classes have been dumbed down at most universities and require much less work than previously. On August 7, 2009, the above-mentioned PZ Myers visited Answers in Genesis' Creation Museum in Kentucky with a large group of students. During the visit, the 52-year-old eagerly climbed atop a saddled kiddie dinosaur meant for souvenir pictures of children 12 and under. To complete his buffoonery, PZ borrowed a cowboy hat. [102] A Boston University professor was dismissed after sexually harassing a colleague and several students. In his defense, he claimed his medication made him do it. [103] Jean-Paul Sartre committed a lot of polygamy , often seducing many of his own female students while in a relationship with Simone de Beauvoir, often having the latter procure several girls for him to seduce. This behavior was common enough that he became dangerously well known for it by the early 1940s, with Robert Francis, in a hostile criticism of Sartre's play Huis clos , specifically remarking on this behavior by writing \"We all know Monsieur Sartre. He is an odd philosophy teacher who has specialized in the study of his students' underwear.\" [104] He also wrote various letters after his womanizing that were vulgar in the description of their sexual relationships. He also frequently did false proposals to marriage to various women, including de Beauvoir. He also largely supported Stalinist Russia and was also responsible for referring to Argentine Marxist -terrorist/ revolutionary Che Guevara as \"the most complete human being to have ever existed.\" Simone de Beauvoir acted as a procuress for Sartre for his various sexual escapades. She also has done a threesome sexual relationship where she and Sartre secretly mocked the woman behind her back. She also has been rumored to have molested several of her own students, also being brought to charges with one of them, Sorokine. She also wrote in her book L'Invit\u00e9e the murder of Olga Kosakiewicz as a means to convey her hate of Olga for her relationship with Sartre. [76] Michel Foucault frequently told his students to go out and take risks on a limb, with neither questions nor answers. In addition, he frequently did LSD , drugs , various forms of sadomasochism, and homosexuality , the latter of which landed him with AIDS , and his infecting countless others during the final years of his life. [77] Intolerance \nIntolerance is a common trait among the almost exclusively liberal professors in modern American colleges, who cannot seem to accept that alternative viewpoints to their own even exist, let alone are held by their more intelligent students. Examples include: Censorship of any mention of creation science in any biology class A recent professor quit his role as adviser to a conservative group at Texas A&M University , opposing their justified opposition to the tactics of terrorist William Ayers [105] Refusing to acknowledge that gun control always increases crime Intolerance of any questioning of their beliefs, even (especially) while forcing them upon their students Intolerance of academic accountability, believing that being granted tenure ensures they can do whatever they want for the rest of their careers, and that they have a right to keep their jobs no matter what. Opposition to drug testing, even though parents have a right to know if their children are being taught by criminals and addicts. Are professor values a crime against humanity? Time magazine's Atomic deacon William G. Pollard has pointed out how professors victimize students, robbing them from experiencing the supernatural and transcendent world (i.e., God ): \n\"Throughout the whole wide range and diversity of human experience, with the sole exception of the West in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the world of nature has been alive with, and immersed within, a supernatural world which everywhere made contact with it, although was transcendent to it. It is this whole dimension of reality which the scientific age has lost the capacity to experience or know. An age such as ours which has lost a genuine capacity for knowing and responding to some great segment of reality is actually, without knowing it, in a dark age.... We really have lost a genuine capacity which the rest of mankind has possessed and actively exercised, and we have become a people trapped and in bondage within the prison of space, time, and matter.... It is primarily the business of the university...to maintain the imprisonment of our time. It saddens me to see a new generation being victimized by this all pervasive spirit of the epoch.\" [106] Professor values and bestiality Professor PZ Myers said, \"I don\u2019t object to bestiality in a very limited set of specific conditions...\". [107] When asked what conditions were acceptable for bestially to be morally acceptable, Myers was silent. [107] \nSee also: Academia and bestiality and Atheism and bestiality \nThe atheist philosopher Peter Singer defends the practice of bestiality (as well as abortion , infanticide and euthanasia ). Despite holding these immoral views the liberal and pro- evolution academic establishment rewarded his views with a bioethics chair at Princeton University . [108] Peter Singer was installed as the Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University in 1999 and in 2006 it was reported that he still worked part-time in that capacity. [109] In 2006, it was also reported that Singer worked part-time as Laureate Professor at the University of Melbourne in the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics since 2005. [109] \nProfessor PZ Myers , an atheist and evolutionist, said, \"I don\u2019t object to bestiality in a very limited set of specific conditions...\". [107] When asked what conditions were acceptable for bestially to be morally acceptable, Myers was silent. [107] \nSee also:"}]
