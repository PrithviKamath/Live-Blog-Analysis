I fresh one soon papered (all to very soon to be honest) minus the extra items we originally ordered (black pudding) this to was almost cold back it went an a refund was requested (no problem ) but this does get the day off to a bad start on check out we handed the keys in and it took the receptionist all her time to say \" thanks \" for the keys... what an unfriendly marked difference in the two receptionists, one very friendly and the order could hardly be bothered. won't be going back."}]
