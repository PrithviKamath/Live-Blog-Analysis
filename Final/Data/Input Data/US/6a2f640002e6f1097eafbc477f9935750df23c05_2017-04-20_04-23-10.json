Either the person who put the page together erred or I have a transitional copy that I can't find information about. My copy is an all black preset with a 49mm filter size (ser # 799372). Anyone else have the black preset (not the auto-Tak) and can verify a 46mm filter thread? I, too, like the 46mm lenses and have three, the 35mm auto-Tak, the 55mm f2, and the 55mm f2.2. I do check eBay from time to time to see if the chrome and black 135 is being offered. I haven't succumbed to the temptation to buy one yet. I have 2 all black Takumars preset 49mm serial number 725714 and 798388. My 46mm is silver / black serial 227358"}]
