She\u2019ll replace David Garland, who has been serving as interim president since his predecessor, Ken Starr, was fired last year. \nLivingstone previously taught at Baylor from 1991 to 2002, and served as associate dean of graduate programs at Baylor\u2019s business school for her last four years in Waco. She has also worked as an administrator at Pepperdine University. \nShe\u2019ll take over a school that\u2019s still dealing with a crisis. Last year, it fired its president, athletic director and football coach after a university-commissioned inquiry found that the school failed to properly investigate numerous allegations of rape. At times, the inquiry found, the perpetrators faced little punishment, while the women who reported the assaults faced victim blaming and received little help. \nThe problems were especially pronounced on the football team. Baylor regents have said that 19 football players were accused or assault or rape since 2011. A lawsuit against the school said that football players committed 52 rapes in four years. The school is facing investigations from the Texas Rangers, the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and the Big 12 athletic conference. Numerous lawsuits have been settled or are making their way through the courts. \nIn addition, a power struggle has dragged on at the school, with prominent boosters vying for the removal of some Baylor regents. \nThe press release announcing Livingstone\u2019s hire didn\u2019t mention those troubles. Instead, it focused on her qualifications. \nShe said she was excited to be returning to Texas. \n\u201cBaylor\u2019s unique culture of care and compassion \u2013 that I experienced personally from my colleagues and that I saw demonstrated among faculty, staff and students \u2013 continues to inspire and influence me as an administrator,\u201d she said. \u201cContinuing to strengthen Baylor\u2019s culture where faculty, staff and students are encouraged, inspired and cared for by one another is a priority.\u201d \nDespite Baylor\u2019s recent struggles, Livingstone will also return to a school that has prospered in other ways. Prior to the scandal, the school\u2019s national prominence was growing. Even with recent problems, the 16,000-student school continues to rise in national rankings. \nSchool officials said they reviewed more than 400 possible candidates and interviewed 61 candidates. \n\u201cIn the end, Dr. Livingstone\u2019s experience uniquely fit the profile of the dynamic faith and transformational leader which Baylor needs at this point in time in our history,\u201d said Bob Brewton, chairman of the school\u2019s search committee.
