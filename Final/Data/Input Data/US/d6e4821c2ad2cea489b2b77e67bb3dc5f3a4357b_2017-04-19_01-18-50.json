Washington Post reports Obama ignored the legal deadline set in the 1973 law that required him to obtain Congressional approval for U.S. military operations in Libya.

[77] 14 June. Preliminary joint staff report released by Rep. Darrell Issa and Sen. Chuck Grassley. [78] Among the findings: agents were told to stand down rather than interdict weapons, they complained about the strategy and were ignored, and Fast and Furious led to increased violence and death in Mexico. [79] Agents were panicked, certain that \"someone was going to die\". [80] Some speculate the deliberate\u200b escalation of violence and gun deaths was a White House Obama administration strategy to influence public opinion in favor of gun control. Chairman Issa continues hearings in June and July where ATF officials based in Phoenix and Mexico, and at headquarters in Washington, testify before the committee. [81] ATF agent John Dodson stated that he and other agents were ordered to observe the activities of gun smugglers but not to intervene. He testifies: [82] [83] Over the course of the next 10 months that I was involved in this operation, we monitored as they purchased hand guns, AK-47 variants, and .50 caliber rifles almost daily. Rather than conduct any enforcement actions, we took notes, we recorded observations, we tracked movements of these individuals for a short time after their purchases, but nothing more. Knowing all the while, just days after these purchases, the guns that we saw these individuals buy would begin turning up at crime scenes in the United States and Mexico, we still did nothing. ...I cannot begin to think of how the risk of letting guns fall into the hands of known criminals could possibly advance any legitimate law enforcement interest.
