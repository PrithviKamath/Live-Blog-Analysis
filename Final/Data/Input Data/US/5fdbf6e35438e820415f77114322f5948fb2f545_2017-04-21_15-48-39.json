We delved into the ingredients, side effects, and scientific research. Furthermore, we read tons of product testimonials. Then, we condensed all of the information we found to give you all the facts for the bottom line. Nutragentex Readers:   Pronabolin. What is Nutragentex? \nFirst of all, Nutragentex is an over-the-counter supplement aimed at boosting testosterone or relieving symptoms of low T. The website doesn\u2019t list the ingredients. There are 30 capsules in each bottle, which might be enough for a month. The supplement claims to be 100% natural, which is a positive to us. \nAlthough we are not sure of the company behind Nutragentex, we do know that the website was created in 2013. This is also the only place one can buy the supplement. They have a satisfaction guarantee and promises real results, but read on\u2026 A jump-start for testosterone production or another hoax? Poor Customer Service \u2013 \u201cCan You Reach Nutragentex?\u201d \nThe first problem we found in Nutragentex reviews was an issue with their customer service. \u201cAn important aspect of any company is their customer service,\u201d said our Research Editor. \u201cIf a supplement is accompanied by poor customer service, individuals will quickly stop buying it.\u201d \nOn the website, it says, \u201cFor all inquiries including refunds, trials, [and] cancellations [of] your order before the end of the trial period, please email or call.\u201d \nThe website claims that their customer service is available on weekdays from 8:30 AM \u2013 5:00 PM. However, many customers had problems getting in contact with an individual at the company. \n\u201cCalled the number on the invoice to cancel, and waited over an hour to connect\u2026then they started calling me regularly,\u201d one person reviewed. \nAnother individual had the same problem, \u201c\u2026you cannot reach a live person at any of their phone numbers to cancel \u2018subscription.\u2019\u201d Scroll   Free Trial Offer \u2013 \u201cWhat\u2019s the Real Price?\u201d \nThe second issue we found with Nutragentex is their trial offer. According to the website, \u201c\u2026you will be charged $9.99 today for shipping and handling of Nutragentex.\u201d \nThey went on to say, \u201cIf the order is not canceled before the end of the trial period\u2026you will be charged $69.95\u2026until canceled.\u201d However, many customers have claimed to be charged more than this before their trial period has ended. \nOne review mentioned, \u201c\u2026A company that has the\u2026integrity to hide the terms of their \u201cfree trial offer\u201d is not trustworthy\u2026\u201d \n\u201cJust be careful of credit card charges exceeding $126.99,\u201d another said. \nAfter acquiring years of experience with diet products, we have found that is can take something small to cut the chance of long-term results. If Nutragentex does have poor customer service and a problematic \u201cfree\u201d trial offer, then that could be a significant issue. The Science \u2013 \u201cAre Scientific Claims Accurate?\u201d \nNutragentex claims to be a \u201cscientifically advanced post-workout pill\u201d that can increase metabolism, endurance threshold, energy levels, and protein synthesis while reducing body fat percentage and recovery time. However, the supplement does not cite any research to back up these claims. Additionally, without knowing the ingredients in the product, we cannot be sure if it is safe for consumption.   Nutragentex Work? \nSo, is Nutragentex a supplement worth your money? Well, we do like that the product has a satisfaction guarantee and is 100% natural, but we have some concerns about backing it. It seems like the free trial offer, and customer service has caused many of their customer\u2019s problems. \nIf you want to lose weight, we think you should try a supplement that has an effective trial offer and a supportive customer service department. \n  we\u2019ve seen this year is one called Pronabolin . It contains a proprietary blend of clinically researched ingredients that can help increase endurance, stamina and testosterone levels. Multiple-bottle discounts and a 120-day money-back guarantee for new customers is available. Learn More About Pronabolin   A jump-start for testosterone production or another hoax?
