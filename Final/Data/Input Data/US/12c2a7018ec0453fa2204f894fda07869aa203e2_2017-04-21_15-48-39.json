That fact alone makes director and co-writer Terry George\u2019s \u201c The Promise \u201d intriguing enough. Historical fiction generally has it over documentaries in inspiring mass interest, especially when actors as appealing as Oscar Isaac, Christian Bale and Charlotte Le Bon are involved. And indeed, \u201cThe Promise\u201d is a sprawling and handsome epic set around the extermination of 1.5 million Armenians in Ottoman Turkey. But despite the best of intentions, the film fails to properly explain and contextualize both what led to that disgraceful episode, which Turkey to this day denies, and why it escalated as it did. Instead, \u201cThe Promise\u201d chooses to focus in on an unsympathetic love triangle that manages to trivialize the film overall. The goal, as always, is to personalize the events that are too big and too devastating to look at as a whole \u2013 to make it about the lives interrupted, cut short and thrown into turmoil because of external forces. Thus we\u2019re given the character Michael Boghosian (Isaac), an Armenian medical student from a small village in Southern Turkey who uses his fiance\u2019s dowry to study modern medicine in Constantinople. Michael isn\u2019t in love with his fiance (Angela Sarafyan), but such is life in Siroun where marriages are arranged and he doesn\u2019t have any other choice. He kisses her goodbye and heads off to the big city, promising to return in just a few years. Constantinople is an oasis of temptation for Michael, who essentially falls for the first woman he sees. The beguiling Ana (Le Bon) is a cosmopolitan beauty and intellectual. She lived in Paris for years. She exudes ethereal confidence. And she\u2019s an Armenian from around his hometown. Ana also happens to be in a long-term relationship with Chris Myers (Bale), an Associated Press reporter who we\u2019re told drinks too much. While Michael is enjoying the city life and lusting after Ana, though, things are devolving around him. It\u2019s 1914 and vague signs of war are emerging. Things go on as normal for a little while \u2013 there are German soldiers at the parties now and battleships in the harbor and a heightened sense that some Turks are anti-Armenian. And then Constantinople\u2019s Armenian intellectuals start getting arrested and taken away. To where is unclear. To fight? To prison camps? To be executed? The intention, likely, is to put the viewer on the blurry ground level with Michael and Ana, who see their world turned upside down so suddenly that of course there would be confusion. Explanation and insight is hardly a priority when survival is the goal. But that\u2019s where Bale\u2019s Chris Myers should have been more useful. To the film\u2019s credit, he does take us early on to distant villages to witness townspeople being rounded up and walked through the desert. Women and children are executed without hesitation and, when Chris is spotted in the distance, soldiers take off after him. It\u2019s clear they don\u2019t want people seeing what they\u2019re doing. He chimes in occasionally with helpful exposition as he\u2019s dictating articles, and yet, it\u2019s a wonder whether anyone who knows little about the events will actually be able to track what\u2019s going on in a meaningful way. \u201cThe Promise\u201d is infinitely more interested in the triangle, dropping the three leads into convenient situations to heighten the will they/won\u2019t they/can they/should they drama, which, frankly, becomes increasingly unsympathetic as the situation around them becomes more dire. It\u2019s unfair to critique such an utterly sincere film that does contain some riveting action and acting and even might inspire some to learn more about this moment in history, but unfortunately, the story just doesn\u2019t live up to its grand ambitions. \u201cThe Promise,\u201d an Open Road Pictures release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for \u201cthematic material including war atrocities, violence and disturbing images, and for some sexuality.\u201d Running time: 134 minutes. Two stars out of four. \u2014 MPAA Definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13. \u2014", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:24:54.000+03:00"}]
