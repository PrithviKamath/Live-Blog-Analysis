We feature new songs from Eurovision artists or national final stars, or their much loved Eurovision or national final entries. This week, we\u2019ve got the perfect mix of new and old, so let\u2019s get into it! Listen to the playlist here: Let\u2019s start off with new tunes from our favourite Eurovision stars, beginning with a new track from 2010 Eurovision winner Lena titled Lost in You. It\u2019s the first song we\u2019ve heard in a while from the German pop princess, and is set to be a single off her upcoming album. She definitely hasn\u2019t lost it! From Ivi Adamou, we\u2019ve got a recent single titled Afto Ton Kero which has traditional elements mixed with a bit of rock. From Swedish representative Sanna Nielsen, we\u2019ve got the new Swedish language track, Inte Ok. We\u2019ve also got a duet of Dami Im and Jack Jones titled Hold Me In Your Arms, a beautiful tune. From some Swedish superstars, we\u2019ve got Benjamin Ingrosso , who is currently one of our favourites after his recent Melodifestivalen performance . This week we\u2019ve featured Love You Again which was released last year. Also from last year, we\u2019ve got Constellation Prize by 2017 Swedish representative Robin Bengtsson, and this was his Melfest bid for 2016. Also part of the Swedish national final last year (and this year) was Krista Siegfrids who we first saw at Eurovision in 2013 representing Finland, so she crossed the border to participate in Sweden last year with the song Faller, which we\u2019ve included in this playlist. Lastly from Sweden, we\u2019ve got one of our favourites from 2013 Eurovision participant Robin Stjernberg titled For the Better. Keeping with the theme of past Eurovision participants, we\u2019ve got Emmelie de Forest, who also participated and won Eurovision 2013, and we\u2019ve got Drunk Tonight, probably our favourite song from the former Danish winner, and we\u2019ve featured the live acoustic version. Also from Denmark, we\u2019ve got Anti Social Media, who we featured in our Top 5 Non-Qualifying entries from 2015 , except we\u2019ve got their post Eurovision song titled Fire Exit. Also featured in our favourite non-qualifiers is Maria Olafs from Iceland, so we\u2019ve got the Icelandic version of her Eurovision song Unbroken. Additionally, we\u2019ve got Time by Uzari and Maimuna, which we thought would be a definite qualifier! Speaking of Time, we\u2019ve also got this year\u2019s entry called Time by the Ukrainian participants O.Torvald . Also from this year\u2019s Eurovision we\u2019ve got Keep the Faith , which we just recently reviewed as part of our 2017 Reviews . We\u2019ve also got other tracks from 2017 artists, including Isaiah from Australia with his X Factor winners single It\u2019s Gotta Be You. We\u2019ve also got a collaboration between former Estonian participant Getter Jaani and one half this year\u2019s Estonian act Koit Toome titled Rannamaja. We\u2019ve also featured La chute est lente by Alma , and it\u2019s left us wanting more from this year\u2019s French artist! Last, but not least, we\u2019ve got Gente Bestial, which was participating in the Portuguese national final , a new single from Sanremo\u2019s Newcomers winner Lele titled Cosi Com\u2019\u00e8, and the English version of Edurne\u2019s 2015 Eurovision entry titled Break of Day.
