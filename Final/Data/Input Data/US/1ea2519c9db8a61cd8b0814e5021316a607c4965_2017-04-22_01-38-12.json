During a fellowship meal after the services, he said the tensions on the Korean peninsula had put into sharp focus the importance of the joint U.S.-South Korean mission.\n\u201cThis morning\u2019s provocation from the North is just the latest reminder of the risks each one of you face every day in the defense of the freedom of the people of South Korea and the defense of America in this part of the world,\u201d said Pence, who was introduced by Army Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of U.S. Forces Korea. \u201cYour willingness to step forward, to serve, to stand firm without fear, inspires the nation and inspires the world.\u201d\nPence told the military members that he had spoken twice with President Donald Trump during the day.\nPence said that under Trump\u2019s leadership, \u201cour resolve has never been stronger, our commitment to this historic alliance with the courageous people of South Korea has never been stronger and with your help and God\u2019s help, freedom will ever prevail on this peninsula.\u201d\nTrump has suggested that the U.S. will take a tougher stance against North Korea, telling reporters last week: \u201cNorth Korea is a problem. The problem will be taken care of.\u201d He has repeatedly said if China, North Korea\u2019s dominant trading partner, is unwilling to do more to pressure the North, the U.S. might take the matter into its own hands.\nAlong with the deployment of the Naval aircraft carrier and other vessels into waters off the Korean Peninsula, thousands of U.S. and South Korean troops, tanks and other weaponry were also deployed last month in their biggest-ever joint military exercises. That led North Korea to issue routine threats of attacks on its rivals if they show signs of aggression.\nA White House foreign policy adviser told reporters aboard Air Force Two that the type of missile that North Korea tried to fire on Sunday was medium-range, and that it exploded about 4 to 5 seconds after it was launched.\nAccording to the adviser, the test had been expected and the U.S. had good intelligence both before and after the launch. The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration\u2019s initial understanding of the launch, said there was no expected response from the Trump administration because there was no need for the U.S. to reinforce the failure.\nThe official said that had it been a nuclear test, \u201cother actions would have been taken by the U.S.\u201d\nNorth Korea has conducted five nuclear tests, including two last year. Recent satellite imagery suggests the country could conduct another underground nuclear test at any time.\nDespite North Korea\u2019s provocations, U.S. officials have said that the U.S. doesn\u2019t intend to use military force against North Korea in response to either a nuclear test or a missile launch.\nAfter a two-month policy review, officials settled on a policy dubbed \u201cmaximum pressure and engagement,\u201d U.S. officials said Friday. The administration\u2019s immediate emphasis, the officials said, will be on increasing pressure on Pyongyang with the help of Beijing.\nThe officials weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly on the results of the policy review and requested anonymity.\nPence will be tasked with explaining the policy in meetings with leaders in South Korea and Japan at the start of his trip, which will also include stops in Indonesia and Australia. He will also aim to reassure allies in South Korea and Japan that the U.S. will take appropriate steps to defend them against North Korean aggression.\nPence\u2019s first trip to South Korea carries personal meaning as well. He noted to the soldiers that his late father, Edward, served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War and was awarded the Bronze Star on April 15, 1953 \u2014 64 years to the day of the vice president\u2019s departure for South Korea. Pence displays in his office his father\u2019s Bronze Star and a photograph of his father receiving the honor.\nREAD: Arkansas Judge Blocks State\u2019s Plan To Execute Eight Inmates Over An 11-Day Period\nThis article was originally published on Death & Taxes .\nThis post Mike Pence Calls North Korea\u2019s Failed Missile Launch A \u201cProvocation\u201d first appeared on Vibe .", "external_links": ["http://www.vibe.com/2017/04/mike-pence-north-koreas-failed-missile-launch/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=syndication&quot;", "http://www.vibe.com/2017/04/mike-pence-north-koreas-failed-missile-launch/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=syndication", "http://www.vibe.com/2017/04/arkansas-judge-blocks-execution-of-eight-inmates/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=syndication&quot;", "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/326341/mike-pence-north-korea-missile-provocation/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=syndication", "http://www.vibe.com/2017/04/arkansas-judge-blocks-execution-of-eight-inmates/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=syndication", "http://www.vibe.com/2017/03/donald-trump-defund-planned-parenthood-abortion/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=syndication", "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/326341/mike-pence-north-korea-missile-provocation/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=syndication&quot;", "http://www.vibe.com/2017/03/donald-trump-defund-planned-parenthood-abortion/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=syndication&quot;"], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "1ea2519c9db8a61cd8b0814e5021316a607c4965", "highlightText": "", "rating": null}]
