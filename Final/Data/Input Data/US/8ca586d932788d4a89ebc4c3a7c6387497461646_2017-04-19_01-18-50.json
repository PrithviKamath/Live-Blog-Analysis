Also a giveaway at the end of the post!\n\nRucy\u2019s Vanity is a cosmetics brand that offers a wide range of high quality Korean skincare and cosmetic products for both men and women. It is a FDA approved Philippine brand but their products are 100% made in Korea, manufactured with its affiliated company \u2013 Derm Plus Korea Co., Ltd. Rucy\u2019s Vanity initially targets budget-conscious Filipino consumers, which value both affordability and quality of their skincare and cosmetic products.\nNow, Rucy\u2019s Vanity are generous enough to send me some of their face make up products to try; namely, Auto Eyebrow Pencil, Gleamy Lavish Waterproof Mascara, Liquid Eyeliner, Lip & Cheek Tint and a Two-Way Cake .\n\nBelow are my first impression review on each of the products.\n1. Auto Eyebrow Pencil Packaging is simple and clean that\u2019s mainly black with white lettering. I personally like the spin-to-pull-up applicator because it\u2019s easy to use. You can draw mini strokes on your eyebrows that needs to be filled in. I just wish it came with a spoolie on the other end, but overall its a nice product that I would definitely see myself using more!\n2. Rucy\u2019s Vanity Gleamy Lavish Waterproof Mascara , 7ml It is said to be hypo-allergenic, sweat resistant and water-proof mascara. It would be nice if i was able to try it while swimming so I could really tell how waterproof it is but I really like how it makes my lashes appear longer than normal after a few coats. It also doesn\u2019t feel heavy in the eyes which is a thumbs up for me!\n3. Rucy\u2019s Vanity Liquid Eyeliner , 7ml It comes with a dip brush applicator which is honestly what i\u2019m not used to. I\u2019ve been using brush pen type of eyeliner ever since so it was kind of hard for me to apply this but I manage nevertheless (as you can see in the video below). If you\u2019re used to a dip brush type then this is perfect for you. Its long lasting and\na water-proof eyeliner with deep black pigmentation that last whole day without smudging!\n4. Rucy\u2019s Vanity Lip & Cheek Red 8ml This one\u2019s very pigmented! You might want to put a little of the product first because you don\u2019t want to walk with tomato cheeks down the streets, do you? A little goes a long way. You can always add more product to get your desire color. On the lips though I find it too sticky for my liking. I prefer to use it more on my cheeks. Size is perfect for carrying everyday because its small (but not super small) and it doesn\u2019t occupy so much space in your bag/purse.\n5. Two Way Cake SPF 35 PA ++ 12g A 2-in-1 product that combines the goodness of foundation and powder in one with added protection from UV rays. It is said to be whitening and non-cakey but I can\u2019t tell just yet because I haven\u2019t wore it out that much. I\u2019ll update you for sure but so far it does make your face matte and look flawless. This is perfect for travel since it\u2019s a foundation and powder in one. Available in 2 shades \u2013 #21 Natural Beige and #23 Dark Beige. I have the #21 shade and it was good for my skintone. Maybe add a little bronzer if you want more depth in your face. It also comes with an applicator (perfect for touch ups) and I love how the packaging has a mini divider between the product and the applicator. I personally like to use a brush when applying this though.\nI hope you find this helpful. I also made a video on my Youtube channel using these products!
