(REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo) Trump 'Buy American' edict may have little impact on U.S. steel By Nick Carey and Luciana LopezReuters DETROIT/NEW YORK \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d executive order on Tuesday left questions about how the government would enforce the order and whether it would make a real difference in output and employment, according to steel executives and analysts.\u201cBuy American\u201d provisions already exist in U.S. law but policing them has been difficult because of waivers granted to foreign companies that undercut their U.S. counterparts on pricing. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump ordered a review of government procurement rules favoring American companies to see if they are actually benefiting, especially the U.S. steel industry.Trump\u2019s executive order promises to properly police those provisions, but avoided detail about how that will happen.Bill Hickey, president of Chicago-based Lapham-Hickey Steel, which has seven steel mills in the Midwest and Northeast, said he has heard talk of \u201cBuy American\u201d for decades, but American or foreign contractors frequently find loopholes to use imported steel.\u201cPoliticians all talk the same, but at the end of the day it just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Hickey said, citing waivers to existing provisions.Charles Bradford of Bradford Research said focusing on \u201cBuy American\u201d for U.S. steel does not take into account that some steel products \u2014 including tin plate and semi-finished products \u2014 are not made in the United States. So if enforced improperly, it could cause supply problems in a U.S. market in which up to 25 percent of steel was imported in the first quarter of this year.\u201cThe people who have pushed for this don\u2019t have a clue and they don\u2019t know math,\u201d said Bradford.Cutting off the supply of goods not made in the United States would create fresh problems for U.S. companies, he said.In the construction industry, there also are concerns over \u201ctoo strict a definition of what constitutes U.S.-made steel products,\u201d said Kenneth Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America.Simonson cited concerns with steel that might have been melted down from scrap metal that could have come from outside the United States, for example, and tracing its origins before that point.Trump\u2019s White House track record so far also helps fuel skepticism inside the industry.Instead of bold action promised last year by then-candidate Trump on the North American Free Trade Agreement, on China, and free trade agreements, the new administration has \u201cnot shown much evidence of doing so,\u201d said KeyBanc Capital Markets steel analyst Philip Gibbs.\u201cI\u2019m a lot less optimistic than I was three-and-a-half months ago because so far what I\u2019ve seen coming out of the Trump administration is the same as the prior administration,\u201d he added.As a result, Gibbs said investors should dial back expectations that Trump will do anything meaningful on trade, or on infrastructure which is where such an order could make a difference.Investors seemed to shrug off Tuesday\u2019s executive order. Nucor Corp shares closed up 0.2 percent at $57.33, AK Steel Holding Corp gained a penny to end at $6.32 and United States Steel Corp closed down 0.5 percent at $28.73.AK Steel did not respond to requests for comment. Nucor and U.S. Steel both welcomed the president\u2019s executive order.The move was welcomed by labor unions. The United Steelworkers said that under current practice, \u201ccontractors often try to avoid the law through loopholes to buy cheap and often substandard foreign products like many from China.\u201dThomas Gibson, chief executive of lobby group the American Iron and Steel Institute, said in a statement that \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions \u201care vital to the health of the domestic steel industry, and have helped create manufacturing jobs and build American infrastructure.\u201dVeteran steel industry analyst Michelle Applebaum said while it remains to be seen how thoroughly the Trump administration will police the steel industry, the executive order sends a clear message to steel importers.\u201cTrump has just created more risk for anyone who wants to import steel,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he puts money behind enforcement that will force people to play by the rules and that will be a good thing.\u201d", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "0f10310bc19383b557d61d3cf0d7d410679e6818", "highlightText": "", "rating": null}]
