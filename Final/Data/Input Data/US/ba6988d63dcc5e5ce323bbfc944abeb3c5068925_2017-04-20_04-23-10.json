New York chased Adam Wainwright (0-3) in the fifth and finished a three-game sweep that left St. Louis at 3-9, the worst record in the National League and its poorest start since 1988.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly frustrating start to the season,\u201d the 35-year-old Wainwright said after his first career outing against the Yankees. \u201cI know Cardinal Nation is ready for me to get my act together, and I am, too.\u201d\nhttp://scoresandstats.stlouis.cbslocal.com/baseball/mlb-boxscores.aspx?page=/data/MLB/results/2017/boxscore550088.html \nHis cap cocked to the side, Pineda (2-1) permitted two runs over seven innings in a solid follow-up to his dominant outing last Monday. The right-hander retired his first 20 batters during New York\u2019s home opener and struck out 11 over 7 2/3 innings for an 8-1 victory against Tampa Bay.\nThe strong encore Sunday was particularly encouraging to the Yankees, yearning for a steady season from a talented pitcher who has been maddeningly inconsistent throughout his tenure with the team.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important because you want him to keep going, and get some momentum,\u201d manager Joe Girardi said . \u201cHe had a hard time doing that last year.\u201d\nYadier Molina\u2019s leadoff homer in the seventh trimmed it to 4-2, but Pineda maintained his poise and retired the next three batters.\n\u201cAfter the second inning, I got more energy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m working so hard to be consistent every five days.\u201d\nAustin Romine and Ronald Torreyes, the bottom two batters in the order, each had a two-run double against reliever Miguel Socolovich during a five-run eighth that made it 9-2. The late outburst sealed New York\u2019s sweep of an early interleague series between two of baseball\u2019s most successful and storied franchises.\nChase Headley, who also reached safely every time up, singled to start the second, and Judge hit a drive to deep right-center, where a fan reached out just next to the auxiliary scoreboard hoping to catch a home run. The ball popped out of the man\u2019s mitt and back into play, triggering a fan interference call by the umpires.\nFollowing a replay review that lasted nearly three minutes, the ruling stood and Judge remained at third with an RBI triple \u2014 even though it appeared his shot would have easily cleared the fence if not for the eager fan.\n\u201cI think that was my first career triple,\u201d Judge said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t mind it.\u201d\nBird made all that moot for the Yankees when he sent Wainwright\u2019s next pitch way over the right-field wall and into the elevated bleachers for his first home run since Oct. 1, 2015, against Boston. The 24-year-old first baseman missed last season while recovering from shoulder surgery after hitting 11 homers in 46 games as a rookie in 2015.\nFollowing an outstanding spring, Bird began the night 1 for 26 this season and hitless in his past 20 at-bats. But Girardi said before the game he saw some good signs Saturday and was committed to keeping the promising young slugger in the lineup.\n\u201cMy timing was messed up,\u201d said Bird, who went 3 for 3 with a double and a walk. \u201cTonight, I really just tried to simplify and swing at strikes.\u201d\nHicks added a solo homer off Wainwright in the fifth.\nA BRONX TALE \nMinus injured catcher Gary Sanchez, the Yankees have won their first six home games for the first time since opening 7-0 in the Bronx in 1998. The Cardinals are 0-6 at Yankee Stadium since Bob Gibson and Tim McCarver propelled them to a 10-inning victory in Game 5 of the 1964 World Series.\n\u201cWe just got swept. I don\u2019t have a whole lot of positive in my mind right now. Just trying to figure out all the things we can get better at,\u201d St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said. \u201cWe just know there\u2019s a whole different level of baseball we have.\u201d\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM \nCardinals: 1B Matt Carpenter was hit in the bare hand by Hicks\u2019 first-inning groundout and appeared to damage the nail on his right ring finger. A trainer worked on Carpenter, who initially had blood streaming all over his hand. He remained in the game.\nYankees: DH Matt Holliday (stiff lower back) sat out for the second consecutive day against his former team, denying him a chance to face good buddy Wainwright. Girardi said Holliday felt much better, however, and he would be surprised if the veteran slugger wasn\u2019t available to play Monday.\nUP NEXT \nCardinals: RHP Lance Lynn (0-1, 5.23 ERA) faces Pittsburgh RHP Ivan Nova (1-1, 2.25) in the opener of a three-game series Monday night in St. Louis.\nYankees: LHP Jordan Montgomery makes his second major league start Monday night against Chicago White Sox lefty Derek Holland (1-1, 1.50 ERA).\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
