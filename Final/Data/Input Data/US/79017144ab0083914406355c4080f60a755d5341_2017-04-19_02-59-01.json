Bite-sized learning via on the job demonstrations, participating in webinars as a cadence program, and engaging in frequent team development meetings are changing the way us professionals learn. \nWalking the Talk Two-week programs are being condensed to one week and week-long training courses are being packed into a few days, where and when possible. \nIt has been established that the adult attention retention period has reduced over the past decade, not because of our inability to learn but because of our increased ability to multitask in the digital age. That being said, changes are being made to the traditional learning environment. Candidate assessments are considering more onsite evaluations than classroom-based reviews as the real measure of training efficiency. \nLearning Too is Now Social Social media platforms have and still continue to take the world by storm. Teaching and continued professional development tools have embraced this change as well. Mobile compatible applications make it easier for \u201clearning-on-the-go\u201d programs and more participants are beginning to interact with one another nationally and internationally.
