[{"entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "text": "\nThe objective of this study was to summarize the evidence regarding the effectiveness and dose-response characteristics of pre-operative exercise programmes on post-operative physical function following total knee arthroplasty, through a systematic review.\nTwelve candidate studies were identified, but only 3 papers satisfied all inclusion criteria: 2 studies evaluated the effect of resistance training and 1 trial investigated proprioceptive training. The latter study elicited significantly enhanced post-operative gains in function for indices of standing balance (overall stability index: Hedges\u2019 g = -1; anteroposterior stability index: Hedges\u2019 g = -1.15; 6 weeks post-surgery). Results of meta-analysis based on the findings of 2 studies showed that, compared with controls, prehabilitative exercise involving resistance training offered no additional gains in isometric quadriceps muscle strength at 6 and 12 weeks post-operatively.\nDespite a potential for efficacy of exercise-based conditioning, this review highlights the scarcity of robust dose-response evidence to guide the formulation of total knee arthroplasty prehabilitation effectively.
