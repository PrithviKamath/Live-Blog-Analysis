He also will serve as chief advisor to the Provost in recommending new university-wide initiatives and special programs that provide the right support and services across the four pillars of student success . \nHeileman also will collaborate with the provost, deans and other campus leaders to develop and execute plans and goals for SAL. His responsibilities also include coordinating policies and programs across the spectrum of student services to have the greatest impact on the university\u2019s co-curricular and curricular goals. \n\u201cWe are thrilled for Dr. Heileman to join the UK family,\u201d said UK Provost Tim Tracy. \u201cHe is a transformative leader whose core values of professionalism, quality and innovation will further fuel our ambitious goals related to student success. His track record of inspiring collaboration and excellence among student support units will serve him well as he begins working toward our shared vision.\u201d \nSince the adoption of UK\u2019s strategic plan in October 2015, the institution has begun focusing more intently than ever on student success, with the goal of achieving a first-to-second-year retention rate of 90 percent and a six-year graduation rate of 70 percent. \nTo that end, the Office of the Provost in 2016 began an extensive organizational shift to realign the number of personnel \u2013 and resources \u2013 directly working with and supporting students, while shifting administrative layers that inadvertently served as an impediment to a more integrated and seamless structure. \nAs part of that reorganization, two previous units \u2013 Undergraduate Education and Student Affairs \u2013 merged to create the new Student and Academic Life that Heileman will now lead. The SAL name better reflects the holistic nature of its role \u2013 to support student success in every facet of university life. \n\u201cThe   has taken a very intentional, data-driven approach to begin realigning student support units and initiatives,\u201d Heileman said. \u201cI look forward to building upon this good work, encouraging collaboration among the talented people across campus and executing a vision based on a simple, but profound goal: helping students succeed.\u201d \nIn his capacity at the University of New Mexico, Heileman is responsible for collaborating with deans and other academic leaders across campus to provide leadership, coordination and administrative support for the institution\u2019s teaching and learning missions. \nFor five years leading up to his current role, he served as UNM\u2019s associate provost for curriculum, overseeing campus-wide student academic success initiatives, curriculum, university advising, curricular and co-curricular assessment, academic program review, institutional accreditation, the tutoring center and the Office of Institutional Analytics. \nVictor Hazard served as UK\u2019s interim associate provost for student and academic life since the realignment began last year. \n\u201cWe are extremely grateful for Dean Hazard\u2019s leadership and extraordinary efforts throughout the realignment process,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cHis deep commitment to student success is evident to anyone who has the pleasure of working with him.\u201d \nHeileman will begin his work at UK on August 1, 2017. \n\n\n\nUK is the University for Kentucky. At UK, we are educating more students, treating more patients with complex illnesses and conducting more research and service than at any time in our 150-year history.
