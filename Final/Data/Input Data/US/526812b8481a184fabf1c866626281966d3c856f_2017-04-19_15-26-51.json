Lacy\u2019s thrilled when Annie schedules a private session at her home to discuss a companion line for her evening wear, but when Lacy arrives for the appointment, she enters the kitchen to two mewling Siamese cats\u2013and one very dead Annie. \n\nLacy takes the kittens home to care for them until they can be properly claimed by Annie\u2019s family or friends, but after a busy day of work, she returns home to find them missing. And when Lacy learns the cats are set to inherit Annie\u2019s fortune, she begins to wonder if the killer was after the kittens all along. Now Lacy will stop at nothing to save the Siamese and find justice for Annie\u2013if the killer doesn\u2019t sink his claws into her first. \n\nLuckily, Lacy has the help of handsome NOLA PD homicide detective Jack Oliver to help her catch the cat-napper before it \u2019 s too late in Cat Got Your Cash, the endearing second Kitty Couture mystery from Julie Chase. \n\n\nMy thoughts \n\nI ado r e Julie Chase\u2019s Kitty Coutu r e se r ies and it has quickly become one of my favo r ites. Lacy, as well as the othe r cha r acte r s and pets in he r wo r ld, have good depth and the New O r leans setting spa r kles. Lacy\u2019s cat, Penelope, is so funny! The idea of a pet boutique and o r ganic bake r y is a totally fo r eign concept to me, but I love Lacy\u2019s Fu rr y Godmothe r shop (and I suspect my kitties would also). \n\nCat Got You r Cash is an app r op r iate title, with the victim\u2019s cats supposedly inhe r iting thei r owne r \u2019s fo r tune. This is a pe r fect cozy, with a good blend of c r azy myste r y plotting and r omance. Lacy has two r omantic inte r ests, a plot vehicle I\u2019m not pa r ticula r ly fond of, especially since I\u2019m ve r y much on \u201cTeam Jack\u201d! Hopefully this will be r esolved soon. \n\nThis sto r y stands alone, but I r ecommend r eading the sto r ies in o r de r fo r the best unde r standing. Cat Got You r Cash is a fun myste r y with a nice twist at the end. I look fo r wa r d to the next adventu r e in this se r ies. \n\nRecommended. \n\nI was provided a free copy of this book through Great Escapes Tours.
