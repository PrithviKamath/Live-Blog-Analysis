Johnson, financial advisor; Clark G. Moffat, founder and CEO; and Marianne Martini, financial advisor. Shane Gibson photo \nClark G. Moffat, founder and CEO of the Moffat Financial Group, has been helping people reach their goals for 35 years, including some clients that have been with him for more than three decades. \n\u201cI have six people that I\u2019ve work with 33 years \u2013 almost my entire career,\u201d said Moffat. \u201cI have many clients that I\u2019ve had for 25 to 30 years.\u201d \nTrust and results are the foundation of successful long-term relationships in the financial world and Moffat and his team provide both, giving clients peace of mind regarding their investments. \n\u201cWe hear from clients all the time that say, \u2018I don\u2019t worry about it,'\u201d said Moffat. \nMoffat and his staff \u2013 financial advisors Jared S. Johnson and Marianne Martini and administrative assistant Lorie Frame \u2013 like their clients to be both comfortable and involved. \n\u201cWe like people that are willing to roll their sleeves up and take responsibility for their future, and we\u2019ll help them achieve what their vision of their future is,\u201d said Moffat, who has advised more than 1,500 clients during his long career in finance. \nThe team at Moffat Financial uses a process called the \u201cFoundation Process\u201d to help clients identify their financial goals. \n\u201cWe lead with the planning process, and through that we help people identify both their goals, and also their values,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cWhen people are clear about their values, it helps them make smart decisions because they\u2019re driven by the things that are most important to them.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s all about aligning our clients\u2019 goals and values so that we are doing the best by them,\u201d said Martini of the Foundation Process. \nAfter a client\u2019s goals and values have been identified, Moffat Financial tailors a long-term financial strategy specific to that client. The plan is constantly monitored and review meetings are held. \n\u201cIt (a review meeting) can be just one time a year depending on the complexity of the situation, to as many as three or four times a year depending on the complexity and the desire of the client,\u201d said Moffat. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll put all the numbers back in and we\u2019ll go fully over everything and make sure our clients are still on track,\u201d said Johnson of the review process. \nAn independent and proactive firm, Moffat Financial has created a systematic process that is reassuring to clients and also helps them stay on course toward achieving the things most important to them. \n\u201cClients know there\u2019s a process that we\u2019re going to go through and it\u2019s the same and that we do this every time,\u201d said Moffat. \u201cAnd as they begin reaching their goals, they begin seeing it. But the fact that is systematized, and that it is a very specific process we go through, it builds trust.\u201d \nIn another effort to maintain trust and keep clients comfortable, Moffat Financial works to make sure each individual is content with their investment strategy. \n\u201cWe just sent out a three-page questionnaire to our clients to reevaluate what their risk tolerance is, because what they stated or implied a year or two years ago isn\u2019t necessarily the same thing to \n\u201cAnd some of them have changed,\u201d said Moffat. \u201cSome of them have significantly changed their risk tolerance. We start with it (the questionnaire) \u2013 it\u2019s part of the initial process \u2013 and then periodically send it out again because of age and stage of life changes.\u201d \nThe Moffat Financial team believes everyone \u2013 from teenagers to seniors \u2013 should be in tune with financial matters and thus spends time in the community. \n\u201cWe do a lot of educational events because we do want to make sure people \u2013 whether they\u2019re our clients or members of our community \u2013 have a better understanding of their finances,\u201d said Martini. \u201cFrom teen financial issues all the way up to Social Security questions, we want to give back to our community by providing them with that education.\u201d \nMoffat Financial has given presentations at both Bonsall and Fallbrook High Schools and has conducted seminars on Social Security at Fallbrook Library. \n\u201cThe more you get the information out there, the better,\u201d said Moffat. \u201cIt\u2019s about making smart choices. But you have to understand the choices before you can make a smart decision.\u201d \nSeeing clients reap the rewards of smart decisions is something Moffat and his associates always enjoy. \n\u201cIt\u2019s fun to watch clients achieve goals,\u201d said Moffat. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to watch clients do the things they want to do.\u201d \nMoffat Financial Group, which has been based in north San Diego County since 1990, is located in Bonsall\u2019s River Village, 5256 South Mission Road, Suite 903.
