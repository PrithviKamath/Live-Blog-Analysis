That\u2019s what happens when I decide to have an early night.\nThis week has involved quite a lot of uni stress, I must admit. But I saw a friend for lunch (and then saw her again at the end of the week), which was really lovely. Also, for me, kind of a big deal because to say I have a non-existent social life is an understatement.\n\nLast year, for my brother\u2019s 30 th , I bought us both tickets to walk over the O2. We finally did it this week, and oh my word, it was amazing! The climb itself was easier than I thought it would be but the view from the top was incredible. We were lucky with the weather; it was a really nice evening. It\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve wanted to do for a long time, so I\u2019m glad to have finally had the chance.\nAs it is Easter, we had a family gathering today. There were thirty of us! With cousins and partners etc, it\u2019s fair to say that I have quite a big family. It\u2019s lovely how close we all are though. I even met my mum\u2019s aunt and her son, and had a lovely chat about books with my Great-Aunt Joan! Just to keep things interesting!\nIt\u2019s been a bit of a social week for me! Definitely need to get back to the studying next week \u2013 hopefully a few long days will help me to feel a little calmer.\nI hope everyone else has had a lovely weekend. While you\u2019re digesting some chocolate, have a read of some of the posts you might have missed this week:\nMonday: Book Review: The Star of the Sea by Una McCormack Wednesday: Self-Care Friday: Film Review: The BFG I\u2019m hoping to spend a little time on the blog over the next few weeks. Although I\u2019ve been writing all the posts etc, I want to just give it a bit more of my time and attention and hopefully generate a real buzz about how I feel about it. At the moment, I feel as if it is falling a little flat, so would love to hear any suggestions about what you would like to see from me in the near future.\nBut for now, here is what is coming up next week:\nMonday: Book Review: A Mighty Dawn by Theodore Brun Wednesday: Don\u2019t Judge a Book By Its Cover Friday: Television Review: Orphan Black, Series 2 Saturday: Book Review: Dragon Trials by Ava Richardson I\u2019ve been re-reading the Harry Potter books since January (slowly, on and off). I think my plan for the rest of the evening is just to curl up with Order of the Phoenix and lose myself for a while.\nHow\u2019s everyone else\u2019s weekends been? I hope you\u2019ve been able to enjoy the long weekend and get some reading done! What are you all reading? Anything you would suggest?
