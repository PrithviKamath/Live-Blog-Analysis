The ESPN \u201c30 for 30\u2033 documentary directed by Jonathon Hock examines John Calipari the coach more than Calipari the man. \nNaturally, we learn all about his blue collar upbringing in Pittsburgh and how he got started in coaching. He grew up near the 5-Star Basketball Camp which is where all kinds of college and NBA players got their start. Calipari got called on one day to run a skill station at the camp and he knew he was destined to coach. His first major assistant job was at Kansas under Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown. Oh yeah, the documentary is framed by Calipari\u2019s 2015 induction into the Naismith College Basketball Hall of Fame. And the frame is one tainted by Cal\u2019s controversies. \nYes, One and Not Done is a little bit of a hit piece. Every single misstep in his career from UMass\u2019 Marcus Camby accepting cash and gifts to Memphis\u2019 vacating the 2007-2008 season due to then guard Derrick Rose\u2019s academic ineligibility status. Memphis lost the national title by a last second shot in \u201908 to Kansas. One important point that was brought up, Kentucky or North Carolina would never be asked to vacate a national title. What I admired about Cal is that he\u2019s totally confident and he avoids the constant chatter about him. Andy Lyons/Getty Images \nOther random observations: \n-Cal yells and he yells A LOT, even when he was an assistant. There\u2019s old footage of his days at Pitt and he\u2019s sitting there with a clipboard in his hand barking away. \n-The NBA didn\u2019t suit his style. Calipari coached the New Jersey Nets for three seasons, leading the team to the first round playoffs in his second year. \n-The \u201cRefuse to Lose\u201d motto came from his days at UMass. It\u2019s also the title of his first book . \n-In the 1992 NCAA tournament in a Sweet 16 game against Kentucky, Calipari was issued a last minute technical foul for stepping what seemed like a few centimeters outside the coach\u2019s box. UMass lost 87-77.", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "a4c90eab7bff016baeca0877da860b29c50fee94", "highlightText": "", "rating": null}]
