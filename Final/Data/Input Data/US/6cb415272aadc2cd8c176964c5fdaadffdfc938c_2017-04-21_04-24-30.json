I know nobody there, and many reviews are negative. Click to expand... Have you tried contacting the schools themselves to see if they have student shadowing programs/overnights? I know my school does these things, and this may help you to get some of the answers you are looking for. Of course, this comes with time and money, so definitely budget what you can!\nJmacJax said: \u2191 If I keep putting it off, will I be burnt out solely from waiting? Click to expand... From my own personal experience, yes. I worked for 4 years after graduating from college to do a DIY post-bac and honestly I think if I had waited any longer I would not have been able to put in the amount of effort required to get through the application process. Waiting really stinks, and not knowing what you're going to be doing in the next year really stinks too. The process takes a lot out of you, as I'm sure you know. Just the thought of going through it again makes me anxious @_@ It takes so much energy and tunnel-vision to get done what you have to get done, I wish you the best!", "ord_in_thread": 4, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "uuid": "6cb415272aadc2cd8c176964c5fdaadffdfc938c", "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "title": "", "thread": {"country": "US", "site": "studentdoctor.net", "replies_count": 7, "title_full": "DO School: To go or not to go? | Page 2 | Student Doctor Network", "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 0, "section_title": "Medical Students - DO | Student Doctor Network", "domain_rank": 3333, "uuid": "711d12f9447e39684d0a56a254a5dd567eee98a5", "main_image": "https://forums.studentdoctor.net/styles/xenbase/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "site_type": "discussions", "title": "DO School: To go or not to go? | Page 2", "spam_score": 0.0, "site_section": "https://forums.studentdoctor.net/forums/medical-students-do.1107/", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZShcLv2AiNvM32EPzqcRyNTjTgNtkeP.0TApsX3EUS1PgTz58Fm0AqSDd_N18ftsyzsuFHTaoO_dJLRLiBz13y4TBQF9MpL3BC0SmbTSecPLg--", "participants_count": 12, "site_full": "forums.studentdoctor.net", "social": {"linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "published": "2017-04-17T11:43:00.000+03:00"}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T11:25:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZShcLv2AiNvM32EPzqcRyNTjTgNtkeP.0TApsX3EUS1PgTz58Fm0AqSDd_N18ftsyzsuFHTaoO_dJLRLiBz13y4TBQF9MpL3BAVqxqziehhrVQUasY_GLqb", "highlightText": "", "published": "2017-04-17T14:50:00.000+03:00", "author": "AlteredScale"}]
