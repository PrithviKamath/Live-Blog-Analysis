The others from the same set weren't available yet in my local store. \n\nFrom left to right, it's Karnak from the Inhumans, Phoenix Five Colossus from the Mutants/X-Men, and of course the Inhuman queen: Medusa, who will be our focus for this post! \n\nKL printing is quite good. Not wow, but also not bad. In the same level as POGO or XINH or KF or WM.  \n\nThe plastic quality on the other hand is a different story. Look closely at the hairpiece, there's a bit of orange plastic on top. Easily cuttable but still.  \n\nIf you look closely at the hair piece again, there's some sort of scratch with white plastic marks on it and it's such a deal breaker. Same goes for the left arm where there's a line of white plastic as if it just got removed from its runner..  \n\nBefore anything, take a look at the painted legs. Not dual molded. Printing could've gone better. DLP for me is still the king of leg prints haha.  \n\nBetter view of the legs. Black on white floor.  \n\nSide view without the hair. Simple.  \n\nThis is the back face. For my minifig though, the head is so hard to remove/move and until now I haven't moved it. Fortunately the face I prefer is the one on default haha.  \nKL brand is a welcome addition to our minifig makers! It just sucks that my Medusa is a bad one. I honestly think that the bad plastic on my Medusa was an isolated case  because my Karnak and Colossus from KL too are just as good as POGO/XINH.  \nI'll add in reviews of Colossus and Karnak soon! Then maybe their whole set when I complete them!  And of course, WELCOM KL BRAND!  \nShare your thoughts below and don't forget to like us on Facebook ! Also, please do share if you have information on the real name of KL Brand! Haha!
