(REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein) DHS's Kelly takes hard line on pot in major speech, closing ranks with Sessions By Vera BergengruenMcClatchy Washington Bureau WASHINGTON \u2014 Two days after downplaying the role of marijuana in the nation\u2019s drug war, Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly changed course Tuesday, calling it a \u201cpotentially dangerous gateway drug\u201d and saying his agency would continue to arrest and investigate those who traded in it in violation of federal law.\u201cLet me be clear about marijuana: It is a potentially dangerous gateway drug that frequently leads to the use of harder drugs,\u201d he said in his first major speech since being sworn in. \u201cIts use and possession is against federal law and until that law is changed by the United States Congress, we at DHS, along with the rest of the federal government, are sworn to uphold all the laws that are on the books.\u201dMarijuana advocates, who are watching closely to determine whether the Trump administration will deal a blow to state-level legalization efforts, decried the comments, saying Kelly was defying science in taking a hard line on pot. Eight states \u2014 Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington \u2014 and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana in some form and another 20 permit the sale of pot for medical purposes.\u201cDHS should stick to security and leave the science to the scientists,\u201d Mason Tvert, spokesman for the Denver-based Marijuana Policy Project, told McClatchy. \u201cThis is a knee-jerk reaction among a certain generation of people that still think of marijuana as this vile, horrific substance and have yet to accept the fact that it is actually less harmful than alcohol.\u201dLegalization advocates say Kelly\u2019s claim that marijuana is a \u201cgateway drug\u201d has been thoroughly debunked by scientific studies. In one review of more than 10,000 scientific abstracts in January, the congressionally chartered National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found no substantial link between marijuana use and other illegal drugs.Seventy-one percent of voters say the government should not enforce federal marijuana laws in states that have legalized medical or recreational marijuana use, according to a recent Quinnipiac University Poll. Fifty-nine percent support legalizing recreational marijuana, while 93 percent of Americans support the use of marijuana for medical purposes.The Trump administration has yet to clarify how it intends to deal with the disparity between the burgeoning legalization of marijuana in one form or another and federal law, which classifies the drug as highly addictive with no medical value, and any pronouncement from a Cabinet-level official sets off speculation of what it means for policy.Under former President Barack Obama, the government followed a hands-off policy toward enforcing federal marijuana laws in states where pot was legal.How long that policy will govern the Trump administration is uncertain. White House press secretary Sean Spicer caused a stir in February when he implied that the Justice Department might begin to crack down on recreational marijuana use in states that have already legalized it, and seeming to connect it to the opioid crisis.Attorney General Jeff Sessions has decried pot use and has advocated a crackdown. In a speech last month, Sessions said marijuana was only \u201cslightly less awful\u201d than heroin, and he declared at a Senate hearing last year that \u201cgood people don\u2019t smoke marijuana.\u201dKelly\u2019s remarks Tuesday seemed to be an effort to bring his position on marijuana more in keeping with Sessions\u2019, two days after he took a decidedly softer line. On Sunday, Kelly had said marijuana was \u201cnot a factor\u201d in the war on drugs, and that the search for solutions to the drug problem in the U.S. should focus on addictive drugs and not \u201carresting a lot of users.\u201d\u201cYeah, marijuana is not a factor in the drug war,\u201d Kelly said on NBC. \u201cIt\u2019s three things. Methamphetamine. Almost all produced in Mexico. Heroin. Virtually all produced in Mexico. And cocaine that comes up from further south.\u201dOn Tuesday, though, Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, asserted that scientific studies showed that pot \u201cis not only psychologically addictive, but can have profound negative impacts on the still-developing minds of teens and people up into their mid-20s.\u201dHe promised that the Transportation Security Administration would take \u201cappropriate action\u201d when marijuana is found at baggage screenings, and that its possession and distribution would be \u201cessential elements\u201d in building cases to deport people who were in the country illegally.Ultimately, Tvert and many legalization advocates say remarks by Trump officials so far are a lot of talk and no cause for alarm.When it comes to the administration\u2019s plans for marijuana, there have \u201cseemingly been a lot of ups and downs that have been unsettling to some and mundane to others,\u201d Tvert said.\u201cIn the end we haven\u2019t moved anywhere and we\u2019re in the same place where we started,\u201d he said.But it remains unclear whether the Trump administration will adhere to Obama\u2019s hands-off approach.\u201cWhen you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing we should be doing is encouraging people,\u201d Spicer told reporters Feb. 23. \u201cThere\u2019s a federal law that we need to abide by when it comes to recreational marijuana and other drugs of that nature.\u201dSpicer clarified that the president sees a \u201cbig difference\u201d in using pot for medical and recreational purposes.\u201cThe president understands ... the comfort that some of these drugs, including medical marijuana, can bring\u201d to patients, he said.The administration\u2019s lack of a defined line on legal marijuana worries officials in states that have set up elaborate regulatory schemes to control the substance and are taking in millions of dollars in taxes from legal sales.A cannabis caucus formed in Congress in February and vowed to fight President Donald Trump, if necessary, to protect legalization.", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "ee434e5b1cfb61f6a5de41a78b95272a05fef83d", "highlightText": "", "rating": null}]
