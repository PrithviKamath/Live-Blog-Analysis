Trump's unconstitutional attack of Syria was grossly ineffective: he didn't take out Syria's air force; he didn't take out chemical plants. Trump make a knee-jerk decision, contrary to what he said about Obama under similar circumstances years earlier. He did not consult with Congress--something even Obama paid lip service to on Syria.
