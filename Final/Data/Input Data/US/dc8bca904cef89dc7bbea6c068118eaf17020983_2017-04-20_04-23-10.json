In my experience (admittedly, I've never used Airbnb in Bulgaria), that is most definitely not the case. If you are nervous about that, filter your search to look only for Superhosts (this can be done via the website, but not the app, for some reason)--you can't maintain your Superhost status if you cancel even one reservation. Airbnb automatically puts a feedback when the hosts cancel, so when we were looking at a couple of locations we were seeing some hosts that had 5+ cancellations and then a couple of reviews in between. I think for our first experience we'll take your advice and start with a Superhost."}]
