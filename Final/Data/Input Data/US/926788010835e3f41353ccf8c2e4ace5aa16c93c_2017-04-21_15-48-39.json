Stephens said in a separate video on Facebook on Sunday that he had already killed a dozen others.\nThe shooting marked the latest video clip of a violent crime to turn up on Facebook, raising questions about how the world\u2019s biggest social media network moderates content.\nThe company on Monday said it would review how it monitors violent footage and other objectionable material in response to the killing. The shooting video was visible on Facebook for nearly two hours before it was reported, the company said.\nStephens is not believed to have known Godwin, a retired foundry worker who media reports said spent Easter Sunday morning with his son and daughter-in-law before he was killed.\nIn interviews before Stephens\u2019 death, Godwin\u2019s relatives said they forgave his killer.\n\u201cI forgive him because we are all sinners,\u201d Robby Miller, Godwin\u2019s son, said in an interview with CNN.\nBeech Brook, a behavioral health facility in a Cleveland suburb where Stephens had worked since 2008, said in a statement on Tuesday that Stephens had shown no cause for alarm.\n\u201cWhile an employee, he received corrective action notes related to incomplete paperwork and missed appointments, but no disciplinary actions related to harassment, threats of violence or other misconduct,\u201d the statement said.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:24:57.000+03:00"}]
