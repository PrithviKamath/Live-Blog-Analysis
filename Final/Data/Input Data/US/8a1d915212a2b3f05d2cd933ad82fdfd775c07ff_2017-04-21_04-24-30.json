But he added: \u201cWhen I talk to the supply chain they think they can deliver \u00a34bn a year.\u201d \nAccording to Highways England\u2019s latest delivery plan, the \u00a32bn spent in 2016/17 on capital projects will grow to \u00a32.9bn in 2020. \nMr O\u2019Sullivan said that, depending on the government\u2019s future spending commitments, the \u00a34bn figure for the investment plans beyond the current programme was realistic. \n\u201cIt is not a massive step up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt definitely looks like something our supply chain can deliver, and talking to senior people within our supply chain they think this is reasonable.\u201d \nThe comments come in the wake of a National Audit Office report into the RIS. \nThe report revealed at least 16 projects posed a risk to value for money and were being reviewed by Highways England and Department for Transport, with options including cancellations, delays, design changes or merging of projects. \nMr O\u2019Sullivan said the report was \u201cbalanced and objective\u201d and raised issues that Highways England needed to address. \nThe organisation is currently looking at re-profiling work along regional corridors to ensure the proportion of RIS projects started in its final year is reduced. \nMr O\u2019Sullivan used the example of the road network from Peterborough to the coast, across which seven projects are all scheduled to start in 2020. \nHe said: \u201cIf we start the first scheme when we are supposed to start the first scheme and finish the last scheme when we are [supposed] to finish the last scheme, we can rearrange all of the schemes in between to minimise congestion and optimise the supply chain.\u201d \nHighways England\u2019s proposals would see 10 projects brought forward and nine pushed back from their current start dates. \nThis month Highways England is hosting an event with suppliers in which it will outline early plans on what the organisation\u2019s planned Routes to Market framework might look like. \nMr O\u2019Sullivan also said the organisation is looking to adapt its procurement model from the current \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach used on RIS 1 so far. \nHe confirmed that some of RIS 2\u2019s biggest projects would be procured outside of the framework, and that the new agreement would do away with mini bids. \nHighways England is also assessing whether to adopt an alliancing model for its smart motorways programmes. \nMr O\u2019Sullivan said those currently on Collaborative Delivery Framework (CDF) would not necessarily be guaranteed a spot on the new framework and he expected to see new entrants enter the running. \nIn February Construction News revealed that only \u00a32.7bn had been spent on roads projects through CDF, including only \u00a336m through lot two for projects under \u00a350m. \nMr O\u2019Sullivan said lot two had been squeezed as a result of the increase in size of Highways England\u2019s renewals programme. \n\u201cI think it is fair to say we thought lot two would be a lot bigger than [it now is],\u201d he said. \n\u201cWhat we need to do is forecast work more effectively \u2013 perhaps the biggest issue last time round was the forecasting of work, but hindsight is great.\u201d \nThis article was first seen on:
