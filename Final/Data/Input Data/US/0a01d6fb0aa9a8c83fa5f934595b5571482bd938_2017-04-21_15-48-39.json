I just sold my latest build for a pretty nice sum and I am going to upgrade to the following unit, which essentially has a better mobo, better cooling, and better storage options than my last rig:\ni7 7700k with a custom loop (d5 pump)\nASUS ROG Maximus IX Code (or hero, haven't decided yet)\nSLI GTX 1080, EVGA FTW Hybrid\n16 GB ram (2x8GB G.Skill Trident Z, 3600 MHz)\n512GB NVMe SSD\n2TB WD Black HDD\n9 fans total (4x140mm and 5x120mm) including radiator fans.\nBased on the fact that I intend to do some pretty extreme overclocking of the CPU, GPU, and RAM, I calculated around an 800 watt load for this system along with a few peripherals at maximum load. I could probably get away with an 850W PSU, but would prefer to have more headroom just in case I add other components later.\nI have narrowed it down to the EVGA 1000W G2 and P2, which I can get for $125 and $183, respectively, through some local deals. I have read both of the JonnyGuru reviews on these PSUs (see links below) and as far as I can tell, the major difference is that the P2 is platinum rated, has japanese capacitors, and a fanless mode, while the G2 is gold rated and has (EDIT) also has japanese capacitors but uses chinese capacitors on the modular board (Thanks to Shilka for the correction). Other than these differences, both have excellent ripple and voltage control. Honestly, I could care less about noise as the PC is kept across the room from me and I can't really hear it anyway. I just want to ensure I am getting a PSU that will supply consistent voltage for overclocking and has the best bang for my buck. FYI, both units have a 10 year warranty.\nSo, the question is whether the japanese capacitors and platinum rating is worth the extra $58 to get the P2 instead? What do people think on the subject?\nJonnyGuru G2 review\nJonnyGuru P2 review\nEdited by JBrutWhat - 4/18/17 at 1:06pm Reply Reply post # 2 of 6 4/18/17 at 12:45pm Duality92 \u2728 ( \u0361\u00ac \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00ac) \u2728 Joined: Aug 2013 Location: Qu\u00e9bec, Canada Posts: 6,902 Reviews: 23 Trader Rating: 15 Select All Posts By This User With the new G3 line up, I'd suggest it. The 1000W G3 is great and short (and overkill, but this is OCN xD)", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:24:12.000+03:00"}]
