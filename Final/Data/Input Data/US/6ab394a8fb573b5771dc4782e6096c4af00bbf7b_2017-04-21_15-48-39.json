This certification requires a hospital to have a safe sleep policy in place and staff trained on the policy, offer education for parents, use sleep sacks instead of receiving blankets, provide community and media outreach on safe sleep and keep a record of progress and successes. \n\"We understand that it can be overwhelming to have a new baby in the house and with all the information coming at parents, we want to make sure we provide clear and simple guidance on safe sleep,\" said Nicholson. \"It's important for caregivers to know what a safe sleep environment is \u2013 the baby is alone in a crib but sharing a room with the parents, on his or her back, and with no blankets, pillows, toys or loose bedding. We are giving parents a sleep sack as a gift to take home to continue the safe sleep practice.\" \nThe National Safe Sleep Hospital Certification Program was created by Cribs for Kids, an organization dedicated to preventing infant, sleep-related deaths due to accidental suffocation. It was created in partnership with leading infant health and safety organizations such as All Baby & Child, The National Center for the Review & Prevention of Child Deaths, Association of SIDS and Infant Mortality Programs, Kids In Danger, Children\u2019s Safety Network, American SIDS Institute, Charlie\u2019s Kids, CJ Foundation for SIDS, and numerous state American Academy of Pediatric chapters and health departments.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:22:59.000+03:00"}]
