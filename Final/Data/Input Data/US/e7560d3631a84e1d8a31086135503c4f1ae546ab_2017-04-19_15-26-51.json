They face spectral Shepherds, man-eating Rukmush, and the ancient giants of the earth. When two of their group are captured, Crik is distraught and powerless. \nMeanwhile back in the city, Durgan, former Captain of the King\u2019s Guard who allowed Crik and his friends to escape from Ungstah, is now a Downer, one of the Branded. Amid the murmurings of an uprising among the Branded, Durgan just wants to be left alone to search for his missing son. But in the process, he discovers how dark the powers of Sulfus the king truly are. Durgan must take a stand in the coming war between the Branded and the powerful armies of Sulfus.\nTo kill any hope of escape for the city\u2019s Branded, the army comes after Crik and his friends to make an example of them. The answers for Durgan, Crik and freedom for all Downers lie hidden in the dark recesses of the Northern Reaches, in the treacherous places Crik and his companions are about to enter.\nGoodreads / Amazon / Barnes & Noble \nEXCERPT:\nThey reached the bottom of the stairs and plunged through an open door into a dust-filled atrium. A gray sunlight flowed into the shattered windows, highlighting the smoke from the Pit that found its way in, but was unable to find its way out. Brakken pushed open the outer doors and glimpsed into a courtyard. A few Downers were scattered about. One was sitting in the corner wrapped in a porous blanket, while a few others were standing and whispering in a noonday shadow. Several more unsavory looking Downers were watching them from a balcony.\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d asked Durgan.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d said Brakken.\nOne behind the other, with Brakken in front, they walked through the courtyard, opened up a black walnut door, and bounded up several flights of stairs until they came to yet another door. Brakken knocked and waited. Durgan surveyed the area and knew they were not in the part of the Waste he would feel comfortable visiting without Brakken. A minute passed and Brakken knocked again. This time it opened, and standing before Durgan was a young man who looked to be about the age of seventeen. He was short, stocky, with dark hair.\n\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d asked the young man.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not tell you standing out here,\u201d said Brakken.\nThe young man eyed Durgan up and down, and then stepped out of the way to allow them to enter. Before the young man could ask his question again, Brakken smiled and said, \u201cThis, Hegg, is Durgan, captain of the city\u2019s watch.\u201d\nHegg smiled at Brakken, and then glanced at Durgan. Suddenly, however, he stumbled back, his young eyes widening in recognition. \u201cI know you!\u201d he cried out, pointing his finger at Durgan and tripping over his own feet. \u201cYou are the captain of the city\u2019s watch. What\u2019d you do, Brakken? You led him right to us!\u201d\n\u201cOh, shut-up!\u201d Brakken smiled, clearly enjoying the reaction. \u201cWhat I meant to say is that he used to be the captain of the city\u2019s watch. Now!\u201d Brakken lifted up Durgan\u2019s sleeve. \u201cHe\u2019s a Downer. And he\u2019s going to help us.\u201d\n\u201cHelp you?\u201d cried Durgan. \u201cHelp you do what?\u201d\nBrakken ignored the question. \u201cGet Koval.\u201d\nHegg glared at Durgan out of the corner of his eye before he left, leaving Durgan and Brakken alone.\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d hissed Durgan. \u201cWhat is all of this? Who\u2019s that boy? Who\u2019s Koval?\u201d\n\u201cJust be patient,\u201d smiled Brakken. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know in a minute.\u201d\nGrabbing Brakken by the shirt, Durgan wrenched him close, but the smile never left the young man\u2019s freckled face. \u201cTell me now or I\u2019m out of here. My wife is alone in your house, defenseless. I don\u2019t have time for these games.\u201d\nSomeone behind Durgan coughed, and when he spun around, he spotted Hegg standing next to another young man. Durgan released Brakken and scowled at them.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he snarled.\nBrakken spread his arms wide open and grinned. \u201cWe, Durgan, are the Branded. You met Hegg. The other one is Koval. We are the beginning of your army.\u201d\n\nAuthor Bio: \nScott grew up in Black River, NY, the youngest of three children.
