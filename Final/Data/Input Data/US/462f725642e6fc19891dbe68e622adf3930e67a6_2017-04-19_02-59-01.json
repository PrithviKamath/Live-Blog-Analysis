Perceived betrayal had burned the bridge between them, tossing them into the icy river of estrangement. But life \u2013 and death \u2013 has a robust sense of irony, and when they learn that their cruel father has died and made his final request that they travel together across the country to spread his ashes, they have no choice but to spend a long, long car trip in each other's company. It's either that or lose out on the contents of the envelope he's left with his lawyer. The trip will be as gut-wrenching as each expects it to be . . . and revealing in ways neither of them is prepared for. \n\nAt turns humorous, biting, poignant, and surprisingly tender, Ashes puts a new spin on family and dysfunction with a story that is at once fresh and timelessly universal. \n\nRead an excerpt: \nTom wheeled his late-model, platinum-colored BMW into Attorney Russell Norman\u2019s freshly paved lot and parked between a brand new Lexus\u2014sporting the license plate JUSTIS4U\u2014and a custom pickup truck. Looks like I\u2019m going after the hillbilly, he thought when he spotted the faded Massachusetts Department of Correction sticker in the rear window. His blood turned cold. \u201cIt must be Jason,\u201d he thought aloud. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d come.\n\nTom took a few deep breaths, not because he was nervous about his father\u2019s death or talking to any lawyer but because he hadn\u2019t seen his Neanderthal brother\u2014for fifteen years, I think. He paused for a moment to give it more thought. Although their relationship had essentially vaporized in their late teens\u2014the result of a fall out that still haunted his dreams\u2014they\u2019d occasionally wound up in each other\u2019s orbits; weddings, funerals, and the like, enough to remain familiar with each other\u2019s career choices, wives, and children. But even that came to an end fifteen years ago, he confirmed in his aching head before opening the door. While his toothache-induced migraine threatened to blind him, he took one step into the oak-paneled waiting room. His and Jason\u2019s eyes met for the briefest moment. As though they were complete strangers, they both looked away. And here he is, Tom thought, disappointed. This is just great.\n\nThrough peripheral vision, Tom noticed that his older brother now wore a scar over his right eye, just above a bushy eyebrow that could have easily belonged to a homeless Scotsman. A jagged ear lobe, a piece clearly torn away, pointed to a crooked nose that sat sideways on his face\u2014all of it rearranged since birth. What a big tub of shit he\u2019s turned into, Tom thought, struggling to ignore his throbbing face and head. He\u2019s as fat as a wood tick now, he thought, grinning, and he looks like he\u2019s ready to pop. Jason looked straight at him, as if reading his mind. Tom immediately looked away, his rapid heartbeat starting to pound in his ears, intensifying his physical pain. Unbelievable, he thought. After all the years and all the distance, his elder brother\u2014by only two years\u2014still scared the hell out of him. He\u2019s just a big asshole, that\u2019s all, he told himself, but he still couldn\u2019t bring himself to rejoin his brother\u2019s penetrating gaze.\n\nThe secretary answered her phone before calling out, \u201cMr. Prendergast . . .\u201d\n\nBoth brothers stood.\n\n\u201cAttorney Norman will see you now.\u201d\n\nTom walked in first, letting the door close behind him\u2014right in Jason\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cStill a weasel,\u201d Jason muttered, loud enough for all to hear.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Tom asked just inside the door.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about playing with me,\u201d Jason warned as he reopened the door and entered the room, \u201c\u2019cause I have no problem throwing you over my knee and spanking you right in front of this guy.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m fifty years old, for God\u2019s sake, Tom thought, and he thinks he\u2019s going to spank me? I\u2019m surprised the prison even let him out.\n\nThe attorney\u2014his hand extended for anyone willing to give it a shake\u2014looked mortified by the childish exchange.\n\nTom shook the man\u2019s hand before settling into a soft leather wing chair. Jason followed suit.\n\nThe room was framed in rich mahogany paneling. The desk could have belonged in the oval office. Beneath a green-glassed banker\u2019s lamp, stacks of file folders took up most of the vast desktop. An American flag stood in one corner, while framed diplomas and certificates, bearing witness to the man\u2019s intelligence and vast education, covered the brown walls.\n\nAttorney Norman wore a pinstriped shirt and pleated, charcoal-colored slacks held up by a pair of black suspenders. He had a bow tie, a receding hairline that begged to be shaved bald, and a pair of eyeglasses that John Lennon would have been proud to call his own. There\u2019s no denying it, Tom thought, trying to ignore his brother\u2019s wheezing beside him, he\u2019s either a lawyer or a banker. He couldn\u2019t be anything else.\n\nWhile Jason squirmed in his seat, visibly uncomfortable to be sitting in a lawyer\u2019s office, his hands squeezed the arms of the chair. What a chicken shit, Tom thought, trying to make himself feel better. Peering sideways, he noticed that his brother\u2019s knuckles were so swollen with scar tissue they could have belonged to a man who made his living as a bare-knuckle brawler. He\u2019s still an animal too, he decided.\n\nAttorney Norman took a seat, grabbed a manila file from atop the deep stack and cleared his throat. \u201cThe reason you\u2019re both here . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c. . . is to make sure the old man\u2019s really dead,\u201d Jason interrupted.\n\nIn spite of himself and his harsh feelings for his brother, Tom chuckled\u2014drawing looks from both men.\n\n\u201cThe reason we\u2019re all here,\u201d Attorney Norman repeated, \u201cis to read Stuart Prendergast\u2019s last will and testament.\u201d He flipped open the folder.\n\nThis ought to be good, Tom thought, while Jason took a deep breath and sighed heavily. Both brothers sat erect in their plush chairs, waiting to hear more.\n\nAs if he were Stuart Prendergast sitting there in the flesh, the mouthpiece read, \u201cMy final wish is that my two sons, Jason and Thomas, bring my final remains to 1165 Milford Road in Seattle, Washington, where they will spread my ashes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeattle?\u201d Tom blurted, his wagging tongue catching his tooth, making him wince in pain. Quickly concealing his weakness, he slid to the edge of his seat. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he mumbled, careful not to touch the tooth again.\n\nJason was shaking his head. \u201cHell no,\u201d he said.\n\nThe attorney read on. \u201cI\u2019ve always been afraid to fly, so I\u2019m asking that I not be transported by airplane but driven by car.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Tom instinctively sputtered.\n\nJason laughed aloud. \u201cThis is just great. The old bastard\u2019s dead and he\u2019s still screwing with us.\u201d\n\nThe less-than-amused attorney revealed a sealed envelope and continued on. \u201cAs my final gift to my sons . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly gift,\u201d Tom muttered, feeling a cauldron of bad feelings bubbling in his gut.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving this sealed envelope for them to share, once and only once they\u2019ve taken me to my final resting place.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d Jason blurted.\n\nEvery cell in Tom\u2019s overloaded brain flashed red. Don\u2019t do it, he thought. You don\u2019t owe that old man a damned thing. But every cell in his body was flooded with curiosity. He looked at Jason, who was no longer shaking his fat head.\n\n\u201cMaybe the bastard finally hit it big at the dog track?\u201d Jason suggested.\n\nTom nodded in agreement but secretly wondered, Could it be the deed to the land Pop bragged about owning in Maine? He stared at the envelope. For as long as I can remember, he claimed to own forty-plus acres with a brook running straight through it. He stared harder. Could it be? he wondered, wishing he had X-ray vision. A parcel of land in Maine sure would make a nice retirement . . .\n\n\u201cHow \u2019bout we travel separately and meet in Seattle to spread the ashes?\u201d Jason said, interrupting his thoughts.\n\n\u201cGreat idea,\u201d Tom said, hoping against all hope that the idea would fly with their father\u2019s lawyer.\n\nAttorney Norman shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, gentlemen, but your father specifically requested that you travel together with his remains to Seattle. Any deviation from this can and will prohibit you from attaining the sealed envelope.\u201d\n\nThere was a long pause, the room blanketed in a heavy silence. Son of a bitch, Tom thought, this couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time. He turned to Jason, who was already looking at him. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d he asked, already cursing his inability to curb his curiosity.\n\nJason shook his head in disgust. \u201cThe last thing I want to do is to go on some stupid road trip with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me, that\u2019s a mutual feeling,\u201d Tom shot back.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think we have a choice,\u201d Jason added. \u201cOur fucked-up father wants to play one last game with us, so to hell with it\u2014let\u2019s play.\u201d\n\nThis is insane, but he\u2019s right, Tom thought. With a single nod, Tom stood. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s have the ashes then,\u201d he told the lawyer.\n\nThe attorney shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t have them. They\u2019re currently at a funeral home in Salem.\u201d\n\n\u201cSalem?\u201d Tom squeaked, unhappy that his tone betrayed his distress.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You have to take custody of your father\u2019s remains from the Buffington Funeral Home in Salem, Massachusetts.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must be shitting me.\u201d Jason said.\n\nThe attorney smirked. \u201cI shit you not,\u201d he said, throwing the letter onto his desk.\n\nSalem? Tom repeated in his head. Just when I thought Pop couldn\u2019t be a bigger prick . . . The migraine knocked even harder from the inside of his skull, making him feel nauseous. Amid the pain, his synapses fired wildly, considering all this would mean: I\u2019ll have to take bereavement leave from school and find someone to cover my classes. I should probably double my treatment with Dr. Baxter tomorrow. And what about Caleb and Caroline? he asked himself, quickly deciding, They\u2019ll be fine without me for a few days. Then he pictured his wife\u2019s face. And Carmen, she\u2019ll be fine without me for a lot longer than that. The nausea increased. Screw her.\n\n\u201cAre we done here?\u201d Jason asked, obviously itching to leave.\n\nThe lawyer nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll need proof in the form of a video or a series of photos that you\u2019ve deposited your father\u2019s remains where he wished. Once I have that, the letter\u2019s all yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow wonderful,\u201d Jason said sarcastically. He stood, turned on his heels, and headed for the door.\n\nTom also got to his feet. He looked at the lawyer and, trying to ignore his physical discomfort, he smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t mind him,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cThat imbecile is exactly what our father trained him to be.\u201d \nMy Review \nI\u2019m a huge fan of Steven Manchester\u2019s work, so I jumped at the chance to review his latest book, Ashes. The premise intrigued me even though it\u2019s not a genre I typically read. \n\nAs I started the book, I wasn\u2019t quite sure I would like it or even finish it. I didn\u2019t particularly like the main characters. Each brother seemed to be nasty and not very sympathetic, but as I kept reading, my feelings had a complete turnaround. As I the story continued, I began to truly care about each character and saw what shaped their lives. \n\nI, also, had a preconceived notion of how this was going to turn out. I was sure it would have a predictable ending, but it didn\u2019t. I was totally taken by surprise in the direction the author went. Readers kept learning new things about Jason and Tom with each chapter.  Each character has their faults but also some good things.  They are flawed people, which makes them real.\n\nI ended up not able to put this heart wrenching, emotional, realistic book down. This is a huge slice of life with characters you can truly care about. Steven Manchester did not let me down with this one. \n\n\n\nFTC Disclosure: I voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book. I was not required to write a positive review.
