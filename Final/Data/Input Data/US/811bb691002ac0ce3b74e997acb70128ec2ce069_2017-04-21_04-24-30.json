It said tipping is a top concern among its drivers. \nLyft has supported tipping since its early days, but Uber has repeatedly refused to include this option, citing a \u201chassle-free\u201d experience that\u2019s better for both drivers and riders. \nIDG raised the concern with Uber in June. After making no headway, it proposed a petition to the TLC in February to try to force Uber\u2019s hand. \nIDG founder Jim Conigliaro Jr. estimates that drivers could make $300 million more a year if tipping practices for yellow cabs in NYC are applied to Uber rides. \n\u201cNew York City\u2019s professional drivers have traditionally depended on gratuities for a substantial portion of their income. Cuts to driver pay across the ride-hail industry has made tipping income more important than ever,\u201d said Conigliaro in a statement. \u201cThe exploitation of ride-hail drivers must end and this is an important first step.\u201d \nCoffee That Won\u2019t Stain Your Teeth\u2026Because It\u2019s Clear \nConigliaro said that Uber\u2019s \u201cbig excuse\u201d has been that tipping complicates the service\u2019s \u201cease of use.\u201d But he said there are ways to make the process \u201cas seamless as it is right now.\u201d \n\u201cPeople do want to tip,\u201d he said. \u201cThey actually feel uncomfortable when they get out of the car and don\u2019t tip the driver.\u201d \nIn a statement sent to CNNTech, Uber said that it has \u201cnot seen the proposal.\u201d \n\u201c[We] look forward to reviewing it,\u201d Uber said, adding that it is \u201calways striving to offer the best earning opportunity for drivers and we are constantly working to improve the driver experience.\u201d \nUber said that\u2019s the reason it has partnered with IDG, an affiliate of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union, to make sure its policies support drivers. IDG is the only organized group of drivers that meets regularly with Uber management to advocate for drivers. \nIt will be some time before drivers start seeing any benefits of Monday\u2019s announcement. The TLC said it will propose the rule by July. It must then be certified by the NYC Law Department and publicly posted for a 30 day comment period. At that point, a final rule is posted and then voted on by the TLC board of commissioners. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll follow this all the way through to make sure it does become a rule,\u201d said Conigliaro. \nThe-CNN-Wire \u2122 & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
