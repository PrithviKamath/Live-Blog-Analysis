Mock meat made of shiitake mushrooms; fish meat from seaweed and soy; cheese and mayonnaise made of cashew, and ice cream made of coconut milk. \nIf you have yet to encounter them in your meals, better prepare your palates for the coming wave of meatless diets. And take note, it\u2019s not a seasonal thing\u2014like fasting for Lent. This one\u2019s for keeps, and it\u2019s the millennials who are serving them up. \nSeveral surveys, including those from the Chicago-based food research firm Technomic, The Vegan Life Magazine and the Vegan Society, showed that millennials\u2014people born between the 1980s and 2000s\u2014are increasingly going meatless. ADVERTISEMENT \nHere in the Philippines, the trend is no different. \nBev Caluma, 22, an English teacher, FX trader and mountaineer started dropping meat from her diet in 2012. In July last year, she adopted a vegan diet and lifestyle devoid of animal products, such as leather clothes, shoes and accessories. Bev said the switch would hopefully \u201cimprove [her] health and athletic performance, and minimize [her] impact on the environment.\u201d A kinder life \nYeye Baron, 20, a senior journalism major from Centro Escolar University-Manila, has been vegetarian for over a year. A video by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) made her \u201crealize the value of embracing a kinder life.\u201d Becoming vegan is her next goal, Yeye said, \u201cbecause I can\u2019t stand any form of animal atrocity. And I want to do something for our environment.\u201d \nAustralian ultramarathoner Wayde Nash, 34, who has been living in Vietnam as an English teacher and \u201chouse husband,\u201d began his vegetarian journey at 15. He then went vegan. \u201cI don\u2019t need animal products to be strong and healthy, so why should animals suffer for something that is unnecessary?\u201d he asked. \nYvonne Liboro, 23, decided to go vegan last year after watching Erin Janus\u2019 documentary \u201cDairy is F**king Scary.\u201d \nVegan restaurant owner Elpidio Mijares Jugalbot III, 26, was reviewing for the nursing licensure exam in 2011 when he shunned all types of meat, eggs and dairy, and increased his fruit and vegetable consumption. He wanted to prove his theory that this would \u201cimprove [his] blood circulation, especially toward the brain,\u201d and help him think better during the board exam. After passing it, he watched the documentary \u201cThe Earthlings\u201d and decided to go vegan. \nPatricia B. Castillo, 28, recounted how she became a vegetarian in 2012. When she hugged her dog whom she had rescued after it was almost killed by a neighbor, she saw fear in its eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized how animals fear death as much as humans do,\u201d she said. Vegan online groups \nA vegan since April 2014, Enrica Nicole Martina \u201cClem\u201d M. Lagon, 22, was a pescetarian for two years when she was accepted as an intern at Peta on her third year in college. It was during her internship that she felt encouraged to follow a vegan lifestyle. ADVERTISEMENT \nBev, Yeye, Wayde, Yvonne, Elpidio, Patricia and Clem are all members of the Manila Vegans Facebook group, one of the biggest Manila-based online vegan communities, with over 11,000 members. The Facebook group helps spread the word about accessible, sustainable, cruelty-free and compassionate living, and comes up with creative recipes as well. \nMeat substitute provider Quorn Philippines has been closely monitoring the slow but steady rise of this meat-free society. \u201cYounger, more educated consumers are seeing the need to reduce meat consumption for health and sustainability reasons. While we have just launched in the Philippines, strong early sales reinforce evidence of this trend,\u201d said Quorn CEO Kevin Brennan during his March 29 visit to the Philippines. British brand Quorn\u2014now owned by food giant Monde Nissin\u2014produces meat-free proteins recently introduced in the country. \nVegetarian millennials now number more than vegetarian members of any previous generation, according to Mercy for Animals organization. The New York Times wrote that \u201can estimated 12 percent of millennials say they are \u2018faithful vegetarians,\u2019 compared with 4 percent of Gen X\u2019ers and 1 percent of baby boomers.\u201d Running as tool \nApart from \u201ca bit of mocking from mates with fragile masculinity tied to meat consumption,\u201d Wayne said he had no real issue to resolve. \u201cI use my running as a tool to advocate going vegan. If I can run an ultramarathon without meat, then clearly it\u2019s not essential,\u201d he said. \nElpidio said that \u201cThe Earthlings\u201d awakened his animal-loving nature. \u201cI also learned that animal agriculture is the number one culprit in global warming or climate change. As a Christian, I even consulted the Bible and it affirms that it is prudent to go vegan as it entails mercy and compassion not only to one\u2019s self, but also to others. It made me realize that I could live my life without harming other living beings,\u201d he explained. \nSaid Clem: \u201cIt\u2019s actually easy to have a vegan lifestyle if you have the right kind of attitude. Sometimes you have limited options when you eat out but \u2026 you can always bring your own food or get delivery from Juicesabel, Greenery Kitchen, etc.\u201d \nThe author has been vegetarian for 17 years, and vegan for 2."}]
