I paid 6 months of insurance from Oct 28 to April 28, 2017 so why did they cancel my insurance in March!!? It took me a few hours to get someone from customer service only for her to tell me she didn't know why it was cancelled but I needed to pay $510 to reinstate it and make another payment the following month. What??? I'm done!!! This is my first review on a company ever! I'm not one to complain but I wouldn't wish this kind of customer service on anyone.", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "070a02b03ad367ea66431d5164323db34b129899", "highlightText": "", "rating": 1.0}]
