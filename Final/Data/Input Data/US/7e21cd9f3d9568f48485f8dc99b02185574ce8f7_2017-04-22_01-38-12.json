The murderer. We want to wrap our arms around him,\u201d said Tonya Godwin Baines in a CNN interview. \nShe said that it was her slain father who taught her, through the example of his life, how to forgive. \n\u201cThe thing that I would take away the most from my father is he taught us about God. How to fear God. How to love God. And how to forgive.\u201d \nOn Sunday afternoon, 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sr. was shot and killed in Cleveland while walking home from Easter dinner with his family. Police said that the suspect, 37-year-old Steve Stephens, apparently chose his victim at random, and then uploaded a video of the murder to Facebook. The social media network later removed the video. \nFollowing a nationwide manhunt, authorities were notified that Stephens\u2019 car had been seen in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot near Erie, Pennsylvania on Tuesday morning. Stephens shot and killed himself after a brief pursuit, police said. \nOn Monday night, Anderson Cooper spoke with Godwin Sr.\u2019s children in a CNN interview, asking them if there was anything they would like to tell the suspect, who at the time was still at-large. \nIn addition to encouraging Stephens to turn himself in, Debbie Godwin voiced her forgiveness, saying, \u201c(Y)ou know what, I believe that God would give me the grace to even embrace this man. And hug him.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s just the way my heart is, it\u2019s the right thing to do. And so, I just would want him to know that even in his worst state, he\u2019s loved\u2026that God loves him, even in the bad stuff that he did to my dad\u2026even though he\u2019s going to have to go through many things to get better, there\u2019s worth in him. And as long as there\u2019s life in him, there is hope for him too.\u201d \nThough shocked and deeply pained by their father\u2019s brutal murder, the children said they felt sorry for his killer. \n\u201cI honestly can say right now that I hold no animosity in my heart against this man. Because I know that he\u2019s a sick individual,\u201d Debbie said. \nShe added that she is able to forgive him because of her faith in God. \n\u201cI could not do that if I did not know God, if I didn\u2019t know him as my God and my savior, I could not forgive that man,\u201d she said.", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "7e21cd9f3d9568f48485f8dc99b02185574ce8f7", "highlightText": "", "rating": null}]
