Stayed in two premium deluxe rooms in building 5. Initially had mixed concerns booking this place due to the mixed reviews however none of the cons came to fruition. Absolutely loved it here. No issues at all. Lovely, friendly staff who were always open and warm. The rooms were both equally inviting and spacious. Yes perhaps slightly dated however does not impact on the quality of the overall stay. Food was reasonably priced and filling. Front house staff spoke enough English if needed and were very attentive. If you have concerns about the noise of the waves crashing, use your brain and don't visit an island destination. Yes the waves are loud however you're staying on the beach and should expect that. It was very calming and added to the ambiance. The issues of the towels as some have reported were not an issue. The system of the towel cards worked and we always had a towel given if provided. Other amenities such as soaps etc were also plentiful and replenished when needed. Pool was also inviting and well kept. Perfect for getting away from the western world and stresses to just let yourself melt away and relax.", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "8d9456731bb6220621cc18aa8c86df8d075123b2", "highlightText": "", "rating": 5.0}]
