A private boardwalk leads through a wildlife sanctuary to an idyllic sandy beach, where you\u2019ll see lobster boats and sunsets straight out of an Edward Hopper painting. The storybook setting feels miles away from urbanization. In truth, this serene coastal hotel is only a 15-minute drive from the buzzing art, food and shopping scene of Portland. If you\u2019re looking for a family vacation that combines the best of town and country, the Inn by the Sea should top your list. \nThe Rooms \nThe 61 contemporary rooms include spacious one-and-two-bedroom suites and traditional rooms with fireplaces. The airy feel is enhanced by accents of light-colored textiles, warm wood and local art. Suites have fully-equipped kitchens and sofa beds, making them ideal for multi-generational families. Beach suites have direct views of the beach and Atlantic at Inn by the Sea \nThe Service \nThe more hotels I stay at, the more I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s the human element that makes a property stand out. From the moment we checked in, every employee was helpful and hospitable. When I mentioned to Mark and Eva at the front desk that I wanted to explore the local food scene, they generously offered their insider tips, including detailed maps and menu recommendations. Everyone from the gardener to the waiters to housekeeping went above and beyond our expectations. \nNature programs \nThe Inn by the Sea is serious about sustainability. Nature is a big part of the guest experience and the inn is committed to doing its part to preserve the pristine seaside setting. Eco-initiatives include heating with solar panels and biofuels and collaborating with the Maine Department of Conservation to restore the habitat for the endangered New England Cottontail bunny. You\u2019ll see many of these adorable creatures hopping around the grounds. \nThe inn offers experiential programs to connect visitors with the surroundings. Venture out onto Casco Bay on a working lobster boat, participate in a garden tour, take a guided nature hike or visit the historic Portland Head Light, the oldest lighthouse in Maine. Bug\u2019s Life for kids at IBS \nFor young guests, one of the best programs is a Bug\u2019s Life. Children dress up in insect costumes as a naturalist teaches them about the local eco system from a bug\u2019s point of view. This whimsical approach understands that kids learn best by getting inside an experience. \nThe Pampered Pooch \nIf you\u2019re traveling with the family dog, you won\u2019t find a more welcoming property. Man\u2019s best friend stays free and receives a complimentary water bowl, beach towel, dog blanket and much more. When the sun sets, your pooch will enjoy turn down service complete with handmade doggie treats. If you\u2019re pup is a true diva, he or she may enjoy a massage or supper from the gourmet pet menu. If you don\u2019t have a dog you will probably be in the minority, but never fear; the hotel fosters dogs from a local shelter. They remain at the inn until they are adopted. Be careful to not fall in love with one of the inn\u2019s four-legged friends or you may be taking one home. Portland headlight \nPortland \nIt\u2019s just a quick ride from the inn to vibrant Portland . This city\u2019s food scene wins rave reviews from the culinary crowd. We headed straight to The Holy Donut . Each fried delight is made from top quality ingredients enhanced with Maine mashed potatoes. The potatoes add moisture and a dash of umami that will make your mouth water. Unbeatable varieties include the dark chocolate with sea salt, their most popular flavor, and the traditional maple flavored. \nAfter you\u2019ve been fortified, stroll the Old Port and wander down the many piers. Portland is a wonderfully walkable city, compact and easy to navigate. There are many independently owned shops to browse, some selling Maine-made goods. \nThe Children\u2019s Museum and Theatre of Maine offers a wealth of hands-on exhibits, so make sure to stop by. Interactive workshops include themes like make your own hula-hoop. \nThe Portland Museum of Art has some excellent family programs so check their schedule for kid-friendly offerings.
