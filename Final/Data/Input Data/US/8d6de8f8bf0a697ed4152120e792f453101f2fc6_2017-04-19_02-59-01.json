It's a good trailer for Star Wars fans, but it doesn't have that wow factor, that \"holy **** you have got to watch this!\" moment that captures the zeitgeist. I would be shocked if The Last Jedi wasn't a much better film than Thor: Ragnarok, but purely as a trailer, the Thor one is better. It has the perfect Led Zeppelin song, suggests a compelling reversal of the usual Thor storylines (hammer broken, forced to fight as a gladiator), and one really great moment that reminds everyone that this is a character they like.\nStar Wars will of course be fine, but maybe the marketing team should take note that once the nostalgia factor and the \"new Star Wars!\" thrill wears off, people come back for the characters. the TLJ trailer was cerebral and intriguing, but it didn't have the emotional impact that really connects with general audiences. A BB-8 joke or a fun Poe and Finn moment would really go a long way here.\nYour comparing Thor to StarWars? out of all the competition TLJ has this year thor is about the last one id ever be worried about.\nif i recall the First TFA trailer didnt break any records. it was the last one that blew everyone away.", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrVYtS81llTP.IRiKX6mVzmeBmdhGMi7hoi7aboiXFvJc4JHwDSklJLLZpEwTl1GVzQguZFTrFct.eQRSbwagf4O4VN8klMSAznOBwnmaTczA--", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-15T16:08:00.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "", "thread": {"title_full": "Discussion - Let`s talk about Trailer #1 | Page 146 | Jedi Council Forums", "site_full": "boards.theforce.net", "site": "theforce.net", "site_section": "http://boards.theforce.net/forums/star-wars-the-last-jedi-ix-spoilers-allowed.10900/", "performance_score": 0, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": 56019, "replies_count": 24, "site_categories": [], "country": "US", "section_title": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi &amp; IX - Spoilers Allowed | Jedi Council Forums", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrVYtS81llTP.IRiKX6mVzmeBmdhGMi7hoi7aboiXFvJc4JHwDSklJLLZpEwTl1GVzQguZFTrFct.eQRSbwagf4XCjp.BaJwTY-", "published": "2017-04-15T15:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Discussion - Let`s talk about Trailer #1 | Page 146", "uuid": "5b22d4ebcdaebbad518b38a2a6b074bcb1766c01", "main_image": "http://boards.theforce.net/data/avatars/m/1383/1383215.jpg?1401037332"}, "uuid": "8d6de8f8bf0a697ed4152120e792f453101f2fc6", "ord_in_thread": 2}]
