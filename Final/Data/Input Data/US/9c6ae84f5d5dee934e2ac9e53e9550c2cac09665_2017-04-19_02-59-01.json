This is the second novel about DC Charlotte Stafford but is perfect to read as a standalone novel. The story is set in London this time and Charlie is a withered and serious detective. Her hair and clothes could use some improvement but there\u2019s nothing to say about her skills, or of those of the rest of her team. They are tightly knit and it was great to see them working together and see the contributions from other team members too.\nThe story starts out with her troubles with Cornell Miller who carried out a racist attack on an old, kind man who\u2019s been hiding in his house ever since. She\u2019s vowed to protect Moses and will try her utmost but will have to divide her time chasing The Trophy Taker too. The first victim of this killer is found in a cemetery, her heart is ripped out and tossed on the ground, her ring finger missing.\nI was happy to read about some real police work in this novel and thanks to this outstanding detective work suspicion falls fairly soon on not one but no less than three possible suspects. All of these men have something to hide and a possible motive. I never had a problem believing their motive. The author kept me guessing good and let me have a good time figuring it out on myself.\nI wasn\u2019t entirely surprised who the killer finally turned out to be and I knew for sure a few pages before Charlotte Stafford did, but then I really don\u2019t need much to get on the right trail ;-). It was still entertaining to see how it all played out and how she really got on the right track, involving Cornell Miller even in her chase for the killer. She did an excellent job of letting these two storylines mix in the end.\nIf you like a nice police procedural novel, this novel is certainly comparable to Robert Bryndza\u2019s series and I can definitely recommend adding The Trophy Taker to your reading list.\nI received a free copy from the publisher, Aria, in exchange for my honest opinion. \nFollow Aria Website: http://www.ariafiction.com \nFacebook: @ariafiction\nTwitter: @aria_fiction\nInstagram: @ariafiction\nNetGalley: http://bit.ly/2lkKB0e \nSign up to the Aria newsletter: http://bit.ly/2jQxVtV \nTake a look at the rest of the blog tour too, next up will be: Chick Lit Club Connect \n", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRNRpJtx15GEOzNMp3eo.gfgPRrH6IgzzRAMzuVSNES6XHKjU36BDmckrMjHKKM5FoYlX9ddeZ_9XiQFpXOWqY8sBYul6QfXDPEwl8YWeMGQz2pbTw9B.8Cwj_dUNVtP84-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T11:31:23.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "The Trophy Taker by Sarah Flint #BlogTour #BookReview", "thread": {"title_full": "The Trophy Taker by Sarah Flint #BlogTour #BookReview", "site_full": "thebelgianreviewer.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://thebelgianreviewer.wordpress.com", "performance_score": 0, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": null, "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "country": "US", "section_title": "The Trophy Taker by Sarah Flint #BlogTour #BookReview \u2013 The Belgian Reviewer", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRNRpJtx15GEOzNMp3eo.gfgPRrH6IgzzRAMzuVSNES6XHKjU36BDmckrMjHKKM5FoYlX9ddeZ_9XiQFpXOWqY8sBYul6QfXDPEwl8YWeMGQz2pbTw9B.8Cwj_dUNVtP84-", "published": "2017-04-16T11:31:23.000+03:00", "title": "The Trophy Taker by Sarah Flint #BlogTour #BookReview", "uuid": "9c6ae84f5d5dee934e2ac9e53e9550c2cac09665", "main_image": null}, "uuid": "9c6ae84f5d5dee934e2ac9e53e9550c2cac09665", "ord_in_thread": 0}]
