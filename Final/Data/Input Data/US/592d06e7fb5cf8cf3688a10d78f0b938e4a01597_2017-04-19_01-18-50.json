Content can be viewed at actual source page: https://www.youtube.com/embed/_xlyDHBuRto \nCastro is a volunteer coordinator at Border Angels, a San Diego-based advocacy group. KPBS aired a story on Monday that followed Castro as he delivered donations to migrant shelters in Tijuana. \nHis disappearance came as he was en route to participate in a caravan that is following asylum seekers from Central America on their dangerous trek to the U.S.-Mexico border. Hugo Castro's family is searching for him since Thursday. \nThe caravan is meant to raise awareness about allegations that the U.S. has been turning away refugees without reviewing their cases, as well as human rights abuses they reportedly suffer in Mexico. \nCastro said in his Facebook live video, posted at 6:28 p.m. on Thursday, that a criminal organization had been following him for days and that they were now cornering him on the highway in freight vehicles. \nHe pointed the camera at an area of the highway where he said the freight vehicles were pulling over and watching him. The video is unclear but the tail lights of a vehicle are visible on the shoulder. \nCastro, who appeared distressed, said he was almost out of money and that his phone's battery would soon die. \nHe added that the criminal organization that he believed was following him was from Tamaulipas and that he suspected the government was involved. \n\"I can't trust the police,\" he said.
