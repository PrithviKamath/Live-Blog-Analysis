''[[Amen]]''. == late January to mid-February 2017 == == late January to mid-February 2017 == Latest revision as of 23:12, 15 April 2017 Contents \nConservapedia proven right , again: Dems attain 43 votes to block Neil Gorsuch with a filibuster . [2] RINOs want to change the Senate rules in order to confirm the pro-choice Gorsuch . \nIn Saudi Arabia , high school ladies are being herded like cattle. [3] \nAn audit of Department of Housing and Urban Development shows financial records have been so poorly kept that they are correcting $520 billion in bookkeeping errors. [4] \nPolitical correctness run amok : \u201c Swedish and Norwegian newspapers on Friday said they would refrain from the tradition of publishing April Fool's Day jokes this year over fears that it might spread ' fake news .'\u201d [5] \nAmericans never seem to learn from history . This is especially true of certain crimes by the same elites we return to office year after year. [6] \nThe RINO strategy of picking the stealth, pro-choice nominee Neil Gorsuch fails to pick up more than 2 Dems , far short of the 8 to 9 Dem votes needed to defeat the upcoming filibuster . [7] Gorsuch should be replaced by a pro-life nominee who has broad support, as Sam Alito and Clarence Thomas did . \n\" Trump goes after Freedom Caucus ringleaders\" who blocked the \" Obamacare Lite\" bill . [8] Conservative Jim Jordan seems the most likely to break ranks and support Trump . \nAbout those surveys you get in the mail from Republicans and Democrats : why do those surveys end up looking the same, even to the paper they print them on? [9] \nIs health insurance really good for anyone? A founder and operator of several successful clinics for the less-well-off offers an alternative. [10] \nDon't count Donald Trump out yet, whatever you're thinking. He's playing his enemies, as he did in real estate . [11] \nWhy is Neil Gorsuch a poor choice for the Supreme Court ? Because he puts precedent on a par with the Constitution and above the Divine law of life . [12] \nA broad review of Trump 's dismantling of the progressive agenda. [13] \nTrump tosses out global warming orders by the Obama Administration . [14] This gives coal miners a chance . \nWitches to cast spell on President Donald Trump - again! [15] Evidently, they think Hillary Clinton is pro-witch! \nUpdate on Unplug the NFL : the Oakland Raiders leave the city with a $95 million debt, and skip town to fleece the taxpayers in Las Vegas for even more money. [16] The NFL is corporate welfare for billionaires . UPDATE : taxpayer cost is $750M in Vegas hotel tax hike. \nNew York City and Chicago areas: Some parents threw a hissy fit after the school recently began enforcing a long-ignored state law requiring that public schools host a daily pledge of allegiance to the flag. [17] \nNebraska Democrat Party chairwoman Jane Kleeb posted a video to Facebook last week showing herself and her staff preparing a bunch of welcome baskets for incoming refugees - voter registration forms included. [18] \nOver 21% of U.S prison inmates are not Americans. [19] Tomi Lahren \nSetback for liberal claptrap : Tomi Lahren declared herself to be pro-choice and insisted it would somehow be hypocritical to favor limited government and be pro-life , and then refused to apologize. Now she has been properly \"banned permanently\" from the conservative Blaze. [20] The only hypocrisy is abandoning the unborn . \nLiberal logic : after the RyanCare fiasco the RINO Reince Priebus declares that the GOP needs to \"start governing.\" [22] But hasn't that been Priebus's responsibility as Trump 's chief of staff ? \nConservative Sen. Rand Paul was excluded by House RINOs from developing the \" ObamaCare Lite\" bill, and now Sen. Paul is considered the victor over Paul Ryan as it failed to pass.

[27] \nTravis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez has refused to comply with Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer requests. Texas Governor steps in. [28] \nConservatives reject \" ObamaCare Lite\" bill ; House delays vote. \nDems announce they will block with a filibuster the \"I would walk out the door\" Neil Gorsuch , who smugly said he would have done that if the president had asked him to overturn Roe v. Wade . Time for Gorsuch to be replaced by a pro-life nominee . \n\" Gorsuch : \u2018I accept\u2019 Roe v. Wade as the \u2018 law of the land .\u2019\" [30] Dems succeed in eroding the pro-life base of Trump and the Republican Party , proving that Trump's advisers violated his pro-life pledge . \nHas US District Judge Derrick Watson committed treason ? His ruling against the travel pause violates not only US law but also the Constitution itself. If, moreover, one can show it gives aid and comfort to enemies of the United States , that is tantamount to treason. [31] \nNeil Gorsuch defiantly thumbs his nose at pro-lifers : \"When Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch was asked what he would do if President Trump asked him to overturn Roe v. Wade , he said he would walk out the door .\" [32] \nTomi Lahren claimed to be a \" constitutional conservative ,\" and was a rising pro- Trump star at the Blaze. Then she declared she's pro-choice -- contrary to Trump's campaign pledge -- and she might want to start looking for a new career with people who do not care about the unborn . Glenn Beck has apparently suspended her show. \nFBI devotes government resources to searching for a jersey of Tom Brady in Mexico , and the lamestream media won't even criticize the FBI for the waste . [33] Unplug the NFL to end its government subsidies, which are at least $1 billion annually . \nMore nonsense resulting from liberal logic : \" Transgender Wins International Women\u2019s Weightlifting Title,\" as the male-turned-female breaks four national women's records.

[41] \nThe massive line to attend Trump 's rally in Nashville on Wednesday was nearly two miles long . Photos \n\" Trump Blasts Court's Travel Ban Block : 'This Ruling Makes Us Look Weak.'\" [42] \nMainstream media bias turns especially ugly: they won't cover a community when tornadoes devastate it because its residents are of the \"wrong demographic .\" [43] \nThe liberal media jumps on Rep. Steve King for saying \"the birth rates in especially Western Europe ... all of Western civilization , have gone down below the replacement rate\" and urging higher birth rates rather than being \"replaced by people who do not share our values.\" [44] \nAl Gore 's latest liberal bluster : \u201cWe\u2019re seeing every night on the television news now a nature hike through the Book of Revelation .\u201d [45] \nAdvice to Donald Trump : drain the swamp in government.

[48] \nThe Iraqi army finally succeeded to push into west Mosul after initial setbacks in the offensive against ISIS earlier this week. [49] \nLiberal logic : Donald Trump won big while RINO John McCain lost his attempt at the presidency . Yet McCain thinks he can order Trump to retract or clarify his wiretap claim, and the lamestream media cheers McCain on. [50] \n\"The Republican and Democratic parties are 'disintegrating before our very eyes,' Ohio Gov. John Kasich said Sunday.\" [51] Translation of the RINO 's analysis: D.C. , you're not fooling anyone anymore . \nYOU'RE FIRED, GET OUT : \"After refusing yesterday's request to resign, the U.S. Attorney for Manhattan was just fired by the Trump administration .\" [52] \nBarack Obama has a team of 12 people to keep tabs on President Donald Trump . [53] \nAnother reason Trump must clean house at the FBI : they selectively prosecute the enemies of Islam when they should be investigating Islam as a dangerously subversive movement. [54] \nThe political pendulum is swinging towards right-wing politics in Europe / France : \" Marine Le Pen is enjoying spectacular and excited Trump -like crowds in France .\" [56] \nTrump 's EPA chief Scott Pruitt questions the global warming hoax , and the lamestream media responds with a torrent of fake news about non-existent \"scientific consensus.\" [57] Many scientists doubt the global warming alarmists also . \nMelania Trump rejects feminist ideology: she wore black rather than the solidarity red on International Women's Day , and her remarks emphasized equal opportunity rather than the mindless equality of the communism that she grew up under.

[71] \nTrump says this about Nancy Pelosi : \u201cI Think She\u2019s Incompetent ...
