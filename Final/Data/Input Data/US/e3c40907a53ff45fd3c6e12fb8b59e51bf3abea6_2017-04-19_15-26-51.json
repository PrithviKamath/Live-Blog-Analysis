That question is a multifaceted one, primarily focused on how a dictator whose hair looks like somebody pinched one off on his head is able to determine when he\u2019s got it just right. How does he know when it looks good? When is the flip angle perfect, the amount of curl just right? What happens to people who call him Sh*thead? \nFailing to address that important issue, the rest of the report on festivities was of the customary communist template that we\u2019ve seen countless times before. Military might was front and center as the procession passed in front of the reviewing stand of officials. \nThe celebration took place in Kim Il-sung Square, in the center of the North Korean capitol city, Pyongyang, marking the 105th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung. The reporter points to the seated Kim Jong-un watching all that is unfolding before him. Talk about pressure, those human statues know if they make one wrong move their dear leader will have them put down. It\u2019s a bad time for their allergies to be acting up. \nKim leans over the railing to wave to the adoring masses below and feed his little, reality-challenged porkchop ego with assurances that he is in fact as great as all of those participation trophies, awards and medals he\u2019s received throughout his life have said he is. \nThe official event proved to the world that North Korea is not the primitive, bland and hopeless society we\u2019ve been led to believe here in the West. They do have balloons, as we learned from watching the aerial display. They also have pink and red flowers or colored toilet paper on a stick \u2013 it\u2019s tough to tell which. They\u2019re probably flowers, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ve progressed to the point of having toilet paper, or of mastering its use. The balloons are surely imported too. Some will be brought over to Kim\u2019s playroom when all of this is over. \nThe centerpiece of the function, the North Korean missiles, are all theirs. Grandpa\u2019s meaningless birthday, the waving to the crowds, the marchers, all of that is sideshow. The missiles were what they wanted us to see, and they brought the attention of the entire world through their provocations, to view them. We were also treated to the implied and overt threats. \nThis guy really knows how to throw a party. \n\nThank you for reading and sharing my work \u2013 P lease look for me, Rick Wells, at http:// www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ , http://www.gab.ai/RickRWells , https://plus.google.com/u/0/+RickwellsUs and on my website http://RickWells.US \u2013 Please SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar at RickWells.US \u2013 not dot com.
