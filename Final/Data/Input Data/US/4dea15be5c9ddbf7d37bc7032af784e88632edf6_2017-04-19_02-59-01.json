They change us, mold us, maybe even save us. But some are darker, dangerous. If we allow them to, they control us. Seduce us. Quite possibly even destroy us. \nThe moment I walked into Sonoma\u2019s Reid Winter Winery and Vineyard and made eye contact with Faith Winter for the first time was one of those moments. Provocative because I know at least one of her secrets, of which, I suspect she has many. Provocative because she believes I was a stranger to her when we met, but I am not. Provocative because I sought her out, with no intention of touching her. But now I have. Now I want her. Now I have to have her. But that changes nothing. It doesn\u2019t change why I came for her. \nPRE-ORDER PROVOCATIVE NOW!", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU44RI0Ao9AzbiRTBlEqgeZwTeI1U3pD1OUFBUYNhN0D1NJngFMSyut5eCs3dGw68OSP.cDoOya24lU85LSmq2Cjj2hRiLj3KmM8-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T03:39:00.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "3 DAYS UNTIL PROVOCATIVE!!
