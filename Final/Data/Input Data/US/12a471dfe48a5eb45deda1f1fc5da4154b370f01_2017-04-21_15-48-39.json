After a brief pursuit, Stephens shot and killed himself.\n\u2014 PA State Police (@PAStatePolice) April 18, 2017\nState troopers responded to a sighting Stephen\u2019s Ford Fusion in the parking lot of a McDonalds\u2019 in Erie at 11 a.m. He led police on a chase for about a mile before pulling over. Stephens then pulled a gun and shot himself as police approached the car. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\nStephens, 37, became the subject of the nationwide manhunt after posting what looked to be his gruesome shooting of 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sr. on a Cleveland street and a later confession to it on Facebook Live.\nStephens\u2019 mother, Maggie Green, told CNN he was \u201cmad with his girlfriend. That\u2019s why he is shooting people and he won\u2019t stop until his mother or girlfriend tell him to stop.\u201d\nA signal from his phone had gone out Monday from Erie \u2014about 100 miles east of Cleveland. To aid in the search, t he FBI placed billboards all over the country, from Los Angeles to New Orleans to Connecticut, noting he was driving a white Ford sedan.\nThe search for \"Facebook killer\" suspect has reached SoCal.This is a billboard off I-5 in Commerce. @CBSLA @KNX1070 pic.twitter.com/49e2GpW5Lq\n\u2014 Jon Baird (@KNXBaird) April 18, 2017\nWilliams said the Cleveland police had received over 400 tips regarding Stephens\u2019 whereabouts. The reward for his capture climbed to $50,000.\nAs the hunt for Stephens dragged on, Godwin\u2019s family gathered to mourn his loss. \u201cMr. Stephens, we forgive you, but we\u2019re asking you to turn yourself in,\u201d said one of Godwin\u2019s daughters .\nThe killing triggered soul-searching at Facebook, which once again found its live video product used to broadcast a violent crime. It took the social network nearly two hours to remove the content, which was soon ubiquitous on other platforms such as YouTube.\nLate Monday the company issued a timeline of events and said it was \u201creviewing\u201d its reporting system, which consists of both human monitors and artificial intelligence, to remove \u201cmaterial that violates our standards as easily and quickly as possible.\u201d", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:23:58.000+03:00"}]
