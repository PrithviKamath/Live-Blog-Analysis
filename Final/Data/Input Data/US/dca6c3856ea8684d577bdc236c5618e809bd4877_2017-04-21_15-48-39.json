My own assessment is that the source was very likely tampered with or staged, so no serious conclusion could be made from the photographs cited by the White House.\u201d \nPostol is pointing out how the images used by the White House, to justify launching 59 missiles at a sovereign nation, actually show enough evidence to debunk the official story from the start. \nPostol notes that the canister appears to have been clearly smashed on the ground and not launched from a plane as the United States contests. \n\u201cThe explosive acted on the pipe as a blunt crushing mallet,\u201d Postol said. \u201cIt drove the pipe into the ground while at the same time creating the crater. \n\u201cSince the pipe was filled with sarin, which is an incompressible fluid, as the pipe was flattened, the sarin acted on the walls and ends of the pipe causing a crack along the length of the pipe and also the failure of the cap on the back end.\u201d \nAs the IB Times points out, Postol, formerly a scientific advisor at the Department of Defense (DoD), has previously outlined similar inconsistencies with US intelligence reports. Following the 2013 chemical weapons attack in eastern Ghouta. Postol again said the evidence did not suggest Assad was responsible \u2013 a finding that was later corroborated by the United Nations. \nAfter easily blowing apart the official narrative on the alleged attacks, Postol\u2019s new report goes on to call attention to the politicized aspect of the intelligence findings. \nPostol said: \u201cNo competent analyst would miss the fact that the alleged sarin canister was forcefully crushed from above, rather than exploded by a munition within it. \n\u201cAll of these highly amateurish mistakes indicate that this White House report, like the earlier Obama White House Report [from Ghouta in 2013], was not properly vetted by the intelligence community as claimed. \n\u201cI have worked with the intelligence community in the past, and I have grave concerns about the politicisation of intelligence that seems to be occurring with more frequency in recent times \u2013 but I know that the intelligence community has highly capable analysts in it. \n\u201cAnd if those analysts were properly consulted about the claims in the White House document they would have not approved the document going forward.\u201d \nAfter reading Postol\u2019s report, the idea of the Sarin gas attack being a false flag \u2014 as multiple high-level experts, politicians, and former intelligence officers have claimed \u2014 becomes far more plausible than the United States\u2019 official narrative. \nPlease share this article with your friends and families so that they may see the what the real experts, who don\u2019t have an interest in spreading empire and war, are saying.
