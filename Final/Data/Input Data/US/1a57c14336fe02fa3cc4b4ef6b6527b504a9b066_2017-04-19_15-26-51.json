Bromberg. Easton Wylder is baseball royalty. The game is his life. His passion. His everything . So, when an injury threatens to end Easton\u2019s season early, the team calls in renowned physical therapist, Doc Dalton, to oversee his recovery. Except it\u2019s not Doc who greets Easton for his first session, but rather, his daughter, Scout. She may be feisty, athletic, defiant, and gorgeous, but Easton is left questioning whether she has what it takes to help him. Scout Dalton\u2019s out to prove a female can handle the pressure of running the physical therapy regimen of an MLB club. And that proof comes in the form of getting phenom Easton Wylder back on the field. But getting him healthy means being hands-on. And with a man as irresistible as Easton, being hands-on can only lead to one thing, trouble . Because the more she touches him, the more she wants him, and she can\u2019t want him . Not when it\u2019s her job to maintain the club\u2019s best interest, in regards to whether he\u2019s ready to play. But when sparks fly and fine lines are crossed, can they withstand the heat, or is one of them bound to get burned? \niBooks  |  B&N  |  Kobo  |  Paperback           \n  \nNew York Times Bestselling author K.

Bromberg's books again and I'm kicking myself for wandering away for so long. This was yet another excellent read by her and I was really impressed with the depth of emotion it was able to evoke. The Player is not your typical fluffy sports romance, but doesn't have an overtly angsty tone either. It was the perfect balance of romance, heat, and witty humor. \n\n\nEaston is the cocky golden boy of baseball, yet not obnoxiously so. He's filled with confidence, and an abundance of energy and magnetism and he isn't afraid to use it to his advantage. What he isn't prepared for is to be assigned to the new trainer who immediately puts him in his place and sees past his star power. After getting injured, the pressure is on for him to return to his position in the time allotted to him, or his career may be in jeopardy. However, no one's expectations are as high as his father, baseball legend Cal Wylder.\n\nEaston and Cal's relationship is one of the main points of conflict. Living in his father's shadow is not a comfortable place to be, and fighting for his father's respect seems to be a losing battle. Though he is gifted at the game, works relentlessly to improve himself, and gives everything he has, he always seems to come up short in his father's eyes. This feeling of inadequacy has leaked into the love of the game until he's started to wonder whether he's playing for the right reasons anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s fucking beautiful. A blessing and a curse. My pleasure and my pain. The only thing I\u2019ve ever known. The only thing I\u2019ve ever wanted to do. \n\n\nI really sympathized with Easton. His father wasn't necessarily mean spirited, but selfish and unable to open up to his son. And it definitely seemed to me that there is more going on underneath the surface with his father that hopefully will come to light in the following book. \n\nScout Dalton is a no nonsense woman who doesn't pull any punches. But Easton has her rattled and running scared very quickly. The instant attraction and desire he makes her feel is overwhelming and unwanted. Her one focus and priority needs to be getting him back in fine physical shape and back in the game. For more reasons than she's willing to share with anyone. Quietly suffering and with no one to turn to, it hasn't been easy to put up the strong front. \n\nBut with Easton, they seem to slide into a natural and comforting dynamic without even trying. Add onto that their passionate, off the charts, combustible heat? Suddenly Eason's game involves a lot more than the one on the field. He's determined to gain Scout's time, her trust, and most importantly, her heart.\n\nI\u2019m putting myself out on a limb for a woman who wants to run, when for the life of me, I\u2019ve never been one to stay. But I\u2019m not going anywhere. \n\n\nI absolutely loved this couple together. Easton was firm and decisive in his resolve to make her his. And Scout was tough, intelligent, and a strong heroine that could hold her own against anyone. I appreciated the lack of unnecessary drama from their secret relationship. I was a little worried that would crop up, but thankfully not. There is a cliffhanger at the end, so be prepared. It wasn't a horribly uncomfortable one, but be aware that everything will be revealed and come to a conclusion in the final installment, The Catch, in June. \n\nIf you love sports romance, this is a must read. The characters are well thought out and engaging, the storyline fast paced and sensual. I'm really looking forward to seeing how this couple finds their HEA in the conclusion. \n\nFOLLOW SMOKIN HOT BOOK BLOG ON:  \n\n\n\n\nView all my reviews "}]
