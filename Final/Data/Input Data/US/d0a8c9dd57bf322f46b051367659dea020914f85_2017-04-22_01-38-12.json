Fifty middle and high school, college and university teams from 23 states launched their student-built rockets as part of the challenge. \nThe overall winners will be announced in early May, as the final calculations are still under review for accuracy. This will include the first- through third-place teams, as well as the rookie award winner, with the first-place winner receiving a $5,000 prize from sponsor Orbital ATK and the second-place winner receiving a $2,500 prize from the National Space Club. \nAbout the event \nStudent teams demonstrated advanced aerospace and engineering skills as they launched their rockets to an altitude of 1 mile, deployed an automated parachute system and landed the rocket safely for reuse. \nThe event was the culmination of eight months of work for students, during which the teams built and tested their rockets and completed a series of technical reviews mirroring criteria in NASA's engineering design lifecycle and safety protocol. \nNow in its 17th year, Student Launch included a visit from NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, a member of the International Space Station's Expedition 48/49 crew; a behind-the-scenes tour of Marshall facilities; and a rocket fair, where students showcased their rocket designs to NASA team members, corporate sponsor Orbital ATK and the public. \nPreliminary winners \n\u2022 Best Vehicle Design Award: University of Louisville, Kentucky \n\u2022 Safety Award: Cornell University, Ithaca, New York \n\u2022 Project Review Award: Cornell University \n\u2022 Education Engagement Award: Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee \n\u2022 Altitude Award (College Division): University of Notre Dame (5,286 feet) \n\u2022 Altitude Award (Middle/High School Division): Krueger Middle School, San Antonio, Texas (5,325 feet) \n\u2022 Payload Design Award: Vanderbilt University \n\u2022 Best Website Award (College Division): Auburn University, Alabama \n\u2022 Best Website Award (Middle/High School Division): American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics of Orange County, Irvine, California \n\u2022 Rocket Fair Display Award (College Division): Vanderbilt University \n\u2022 Rocket Fair Display Award (Middle/High School Division): McKinney High School, Texas \n\u2022 Best Looking Rocket Award (College Division): Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa \n\u2022 Best Looking Rocket Award (Middle/High School Division): Engineering and Technologies Academy at Roosevelt School, San Antonio, Texas \n\u2022 Team Spirit Award (College Division): U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland \n\u2022 Team Spirit (Middle/High School Division): Engineering and Technologies Academy at Roosevelt School \n\u2022 Judges' Choice Award: Northern Illinois Home School Association, Montgomery, Illinois Tags", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "d0a8c9dd57bf322f46b051367659dea020914f85", "highlightText": "", "rating": null}]
