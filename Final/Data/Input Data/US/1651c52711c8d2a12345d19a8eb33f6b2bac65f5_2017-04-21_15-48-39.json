We\u2019ll find out by taking a deep dive into the ingredients, side effects, and clinical research. We also read many dieter experiences to get their side of the issue. Finally, we condensed all this information to give you the details you want to know. Multiplex Garcinia Readers:   Leptigen. What is Multiplex Garcinia? \nFirst off, Multiplex Garcinia is a natural supplement that aims at improving weight-loss results. We are not sure about the ingredients, although we believe it contains hydroxycitric acid. There\u2019s not a lot of information on how to take the supplement, but it seems the ingredient list is quite short, which we like to see. \nThe only information we could find surrounding Multiplex Garcinia was that their website was created in 2016, which is the only place you can buy the product. We like that Garcinia cambogia has been researched and that it has many claims of health benefits but read on\u2026 Is Multiplex a complex alternative to other garcinia supplements? Free Trial Offer \u2013 \u201cHow Much Does It Cost?\u201d \nThe first issue we found with Multiplex Garcinia was their free trial offer. \u201cUnfortunately, a lot of scam supplements use free trial offers to get money out of individuals,\u201d said our Research Editor. \u201cIf this is the case with Multiplex Garcinia, there could be a real problem.\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t pay for this trial, five days later you get billed for $95, and they don\u2019t answer the calls,\u201d said a user. \n\u201cPaid for the trial offer and in less than 14 days\u2026charged over 200.00\u2026,\u201d commented another. \nWe could not find any reviews about the trial offer that were not negative. Scroll   Billing Issues \u2013 \u201cHow Much Do You Pay for Multiplex Garcinia?\u201d \nThe second problem we found with Multiplex Garcinia was their billing. Multiple reviews reported charges, but never receiving the product. \n\u201cThey attached a green coffee trial to my order and billed me $93.63 for each two weeks later,\u201d one customer said. \nAnother had a similar experience, saying, \u201cTerrible experience\u2026I\u2019m out over $200 because they snuck the green tea product in.\u201d \nUnfortunately, we could not find any positive comments concerning their billing, but there could be some out there. \nAfter years of researching diet products, we found it can take something that seems irrelevant to slash the chance of measurable results. If Multiplex Garcinia has issues with their free trial offer and billing, that could be a major problem. The Science \u2013 \u201cWhat Does the Research Say?\u201d \nThere\u2019s research into Garcinia cambogia, the main component in Multiplex Garcinia. However, very few of the studies point to its weight-loss abilities. Additionally, the supplement does not cite any resources to back up their claims. Before we recommend any product, we like to see a significant amount of science, which does not seem to be present here.   Multiplex Garcinia Work? \nAre we racing out to buy some Multiplex Garcinia? Well, we like that this supplement has a small ingredient list and that Garcinia cambogia has been researched. However, we have some reservations because of their free trial offer and billing issues. \nIf you want to lose weight, we suggest using a product that does not try to bill you for something you did not buy. \n  we\u2019ve seen this year is Leptigen . Its formula includes a proprietary blend of four clinically researched ingredients have been shown to help spark fat burn and reduce appetite. Comments around the web indicate that people see great results. \nAdditionally, the company is offering a Special Trial Offer for all new customers, which seems like a great deal to us.
