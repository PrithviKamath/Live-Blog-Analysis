Setting this appropriately can help prevent annoying people from creating fake Facebook accounts that have the same profile photo and name as you, and that then try to trick all your Facebook contacts into become friends with them. \nThere\u2019s no one answer to setting privacy settings. Some people might be quite happy to share everything with everyone whereas others will prefer to keep things strictly between friends. The important thing is that you understand and are comfortable with what you\u2019re sharing to whom. To review your general privacy settings Click on the drop-down menu on the top right in Facebook in your web browser On the left, click Privacy Review the settings and change to your preference if necessary. To restrict who can see your profile picture Go to your Facebook profile (click on your name in the top menu bar in Facebook in your web browser) Click on your profile photo To the right of the photo, click on the icon next to the date Review the current setting and change to your preference if necessary. Choosing a non-public option will reduce the risk of someone copying your profile photo. On the other hand it will make it harder for potential friends to find you. To restrict who can see your friends Go to your Facebook profile Click on Friends Click on the \u2018Pencil\u2019 icon (Manage) Click Edit Privacy Review the current settings. Choosing a non-public option will reduce the risk of someone pretending to be you trying to contact all your friends. \nDon\u2019t just accept the defaults, be deliberate and intentional about exactly how much and to who you are sharing your Facebook information with.", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQnFiWvB_l9TFdMY4dOJ.IpGqUiRHZANjz6tQ8wmYFmxQVxsULDwqnRHMYsEMG7ZTiCMc1ISo5giLUheFw7S9SfpJDaUQkYNWY-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T09:52:58.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "Setting your Facebook privacy and sharing", "thread": {"title_full": "Setting your Facebook privacy and sharing", "site_full": "david.gardiner.net.au", "site": "gardiner.net.au", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/DavesDaydreams", "performance_score": 0, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": null, "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "country": "US", "section_title": "David Gardiner - Dave's Daydreams", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQnFiWvB_l9TFdMY4dOJ.IpGqUiRHZANjz6tQ8wmYFmxQVxsULDwqnRHMYsEMG7ZTiCMc1ISo5giLUheFw7S9SfpJDaUQkYNWY-", "published": "2017-04-16T09:52:58.000+03:00", "title": "Setting your Facebook privacy and sharing", "uuid": "083110089360a58c93aa600285b18a16f673cb34", "main_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-d-Gifn1Gs5s/WPMOI3ntH4I/AAAAAAAACA0/tI6rosFsykE/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/Facebook-Profile-Photo-Settings_thum.jpg?imgmax=800"}, "uuid": "083110089360a58c93aa600285b18a16f673cb34", "ord_in_thread": 0}]
