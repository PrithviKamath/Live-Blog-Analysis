But while Barack Obama was still in the White House, Donald Trump announced \u201cdeals\u201d and appointments that made it seem as if he were already in office, hitting the ground running to Make America Great Again. On the entirely subjective calculus of wins, he probably had more before his inauguration than any President.Conversely, the first 100 days are supposed to be a time of big domestic legislative achievements. Instead, they\u2019ve looked more like the lame-duck period of a President\u2019s second term.Once sworn in, rather than get a political honeymoon with the news media, Trump had an angry divorce. And instead of giving Trump a big gift-wrapped box of legislation, Congress has mostly given him the sorts of headaches Presidents have to deal with when they\u2019ve lost their clout.The White House is touting its raft of executive orders as proof that things are getting done and promises are being kept. That\u2019s a fair spin. Trump campaigned on repealing a slew of Obama\u2019s executive orders and other \u201cjob-killing\u201d regulations.But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Presidents usually turn to executive orders when getting big stuff through Congress is impossible and to prove they still have their mojo. Hence Obama\u2019s famous quip in 2014 that he still had \u201ca pen and a phone.\u201dThere\u2019s another thing Presidents famously do in their second terms, when Congress isn\u2019t interested in the President\u2019s agenda: retreat to foreign policy. Ronald Reagan concentrated on dealing with the Soviets. Bill Clinton focused on peace negotiations in Northern Ireland and the Middle East and his air war in the former Yugoslavia. George W. Bush launched the surge in Iraq, gave a shot at Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and ramped up a massive humanitarian effort to fight AIDS in Africa. Obama\u2019s second term was dominated by his obsession with getting a nuclear deal with Iran.And now President Trump, early in his first term, is trying the same trick. That\u2019s because, according to many reports from inside the shockingly leaky White House (another feature of lame duck presidencies, when staffers look to their own political futures,) Trump is eager for \u201cwins.\u201d As Trump informal adviser Larry Kudlow told the Washington Post, \u201cThe President wants W\u2019s \u2014 he wants wins.\u201dHis biggest \u201cW\u201d to date was the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, which came when he turned to seasoned pros who know how to get things done in Washington, namely Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society. His other big \u201cW\u201d was his missile strike on Syria, for which he also had seasoned pros to thank: Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster.It\u2019s early yet, but that strike, combined with Trump\u2019s authorization of a massive bomb drop on an alleged Islamic State compound in Afghanistan, has yielded other apparent foreign policy W\u2019s. China seems to be cooperating in the administration\u2019s effort to squeeze the North Korean regime. Domestically, these moves succeeded in sucking some of the oxygen out of the media\u2019s feeding frenzy over allegations that Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia and claims that he is a \u201cpuppet\u201d of Russian President Vladimir Putin.It seems a fair guess that Trump\u2019s response will be \u201cmore, please.\u201d As Fox News anchor Bret Baier recently put it, Trump is \u201cnot that ideological. He is more practical and he is looking for W\u2019s, wins. If you turn to the Pentagon and say, \u2018give me some wins,\u2019 they have got a long list of things that can produce W\u2019s.\u201dTrump\u2019s sudden transformation into a foreign policy President isn\u2019t necessarily sinister. Obama\u2019s policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d and \u201cleading from behind\u201d left a lot of low-hanging fruit for Trump to pluck.The question is, what happens when the list of easy W\u2019s runs out? There\u2019s little evidence that Trump is operating with a coherent strategic vision, which means that he won\u2019t have a thought-out criteria for knowing when to say no to the generals he clearly admires. For a true lame-duck President, that may not matter \u2014 when the W\u2019s run out, he\u2019s out of office. For a first-term President who just acts like a lame-duck President, it\u2019s another story.
