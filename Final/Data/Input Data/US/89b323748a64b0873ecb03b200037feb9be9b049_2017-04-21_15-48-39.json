Ted Yoho, R-Fla., is the vice chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the chairman of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee. After North Korea\u2019s failed missile launch at the end of last week, Yoho took aim at the North Korean leadership, slamming \u201cKim Jong-un\u2019s complete disregard for international law and determination to obtain a nuclear weapon capable of striking the continental United States.\u201d \nThe North Florida congressman urged tougher action against North Korea after the missile test. \n\u201cSuch belligerent action cannot and should not be rewarded with a simple slap on the wrist,\u201d Yoho insisted. \u201cInstead, we need to take real action. \n\u201cThrough targeted, secondary sanctions on foreign companies that continue to do business with Pyongyang, we can hit Kim Jong-un where it hurts most: the wallet,\u201d Yoho added. \u201cKim relies on these funds for his illicit nuclear and missile programs, and we must use every tool we have to deny him the hard currency he needs.\u201d \nYoho urged President Donald Trump and the State Department to include North Korea as a state sponsor of terror. Currently, a president can remove a nation from the State Department\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism after a six month period. In January , Yoho brought back a proposal extending that period to two years. His legislation also doubles the amount of time Congress has in reviewing the executive branch\u2019s decision to remove a nation from the state sponsor of terror list from 45 days to 90 days. \n\u201cThe administration also needs to reinstate North Korea as a state sponsor of terror,\u201d Yoho said. \u201cThese decisive actions will send a clear message to the international community as a whole that the United States is committed to peace on the Korean Peninsula and will do what is necessary to achieve it.\u201d \nEarlier this month , Yoho and U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., paired up with U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel, D-NY, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., to unveil a proposal extending the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004, which Ros-Lehtinen has championed during her long tenure in Congress. The legislation \u201ccontinues current authorities for North Korea-focused activities to promote human rights and democracy, refugee protection, and freedom of information (including broadcasting), as well as the U.S. Special Envoy on North Korean Human Rights Issues\" and \u201ccontinues reporting aimed at increasing transparency and accountability for any food aid provided to North Korea.\u201d \nYoho is not the only member of the Florida delegation focused on North Korea in recent days. U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-Fla., was part of a congressional delegation which toured American military stations in Asia last week, including the demilitarized zone dividing North and South Korea. Frankel and the other representatives met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean Minister Yun Byung-se and military experts. \nOn Monday, Frankel weighed in on the situation in Asia, calling for continued support of Japan and South Korea. \n\u201cA strong unwavering relationship between the U.S. and its allies Japan and South Korea is necessary for the national and economic security of all three countries,\u201d Frankel said. \u201cJapan and South Korea are two of America's greatest trading partners and home to important U.S. military bases. A North Korea that has the capability to use a nuclear weapon that can reach an American city or those of an ally poses a grave challenge as the U.S. seeks to preserve peace and stability in the region. \n\u201cIn this regard, the United States, in consultation with Japan and South Korea, must explore all reasonable economic, diplomatic and defensive actions such as cyber that would prevent North Korea from developing such a capability,\u201d Frankel added. \u201cThis includes further engagement with and economic pressure on China, which North Korea depends upon for 90 percent of its trade. A military strike is an untenable option that would most likely result in a devastating conventional military attack by North Korea on Seoul, South Korea, a megacity with a population of over 25 million including tens of thousands of U.S. military personnel.\u201d", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:24:29.000+03:00"}]
