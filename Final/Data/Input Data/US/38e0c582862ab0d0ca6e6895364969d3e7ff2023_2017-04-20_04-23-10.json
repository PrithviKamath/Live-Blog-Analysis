CTG received 76 submissions from intimate theatre companies throughout the L.A. area. Each company was able to submit one production that opened between January 1, 2015, and August 12, 2016. Three were selected, and each will now be given a two-week run. Tonight, the first of the three shows, Coeurage Theatre\u2019s whimsically uplifting, emotionally devastating, theatrically inventive Failure: A Love Story began its short run. Two years ago, Stage and Cinema \u2019s writer Jason Rohrer wrote an unassailable review that captured this gem\u2019s essence perfectly. When asked if he wished to write a review of this newly mounted production, he wrote, \u201cTwo years ago, at the 98-seat Grove Theater Center, I saw the best show I\u2019d ever seen in an intimate house. Tonight I watched the same production revived at the much larger, 317-seat Kirk Douglas Theatre. The difference is substantial. It is now the best show I\u2019ve seen in a mid-size house.\u201d Indeed, this is the richest, most satisfying play in memory, and may be one of the best shows you will ever see in your life. Here are the photos. Don\u2019t miss it.] \nphotos by Craig Schwartz"}]
