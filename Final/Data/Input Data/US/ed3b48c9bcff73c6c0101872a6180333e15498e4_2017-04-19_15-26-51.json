We will update close friends and family when service arrangements have been made and will notify the public of an open memorial service, which all would be welcome. We are undeniably still in shock with his unexpected death and cannot begin to put into words the overwhelming sadness we are experiencing. He is missed tremendously.\" \u2014 Louise, Sam, Emily & Rori At press time, further details were sketchy, and we will continue to develop this story. Guitar Player just reviewed his latest box set in the May 2017 issue: The Man Who Changed Guitar Forever Allan Holdsworth It\u2019s not often that Guitar Player is credited with naming an album, but our April 2008 cover story on Holdsworth inspired the title of this massive 12-CD box set. I\u2019d say, \u201cThanks and bravo,\u201d but, apparently, the maestro was somewhat embarrassed by the slogan. Not that he should be, because this collection of albums from 1982\u2019s I.O.U to 2003\u2019s Then! proves Holdsworth\u2019s astonishing technique, unbridled creativity, iridescent tone, dynamic touch, exquisite taste, and expansive melodic strategies have absolutely changed guitarcraft for any player aspiring beyond his or her first barre chord. It\u2019s a humbling experience to relive these seminal albums\u2014how can he be so imaginative and, well, scary brilliant?\u2014but it\u2019s also a treasure trove of possibilities and vision.
