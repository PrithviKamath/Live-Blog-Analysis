This does not affect our opinion of the book or the content of our review. \nI thoroughly enjoyed this fun and flirty story. What makes it so captivating are the well-developed characters and the witty, snappy dialogue. I enjoyed the main characters and all the entertaining secondary characters. This is a fast paced story with a hunky, alpha male hero and a sassy heroine. \nSpecial agent John Shepperd and special agent Jessica Harlow first meet when they go through the FBI academy in Quantico together. They spend twenty-one weeks trying to outwit each other and compete over everything. By the end of their training, they loathe each other and hope they never meet again. Before joining the FBI, John was an Army Ranger and is the biggest, most athletic in their training group. While Jessica, an attorney, is one of two women in their class and feels she has to constantly prove herself. \nNow, six years later, Jessica moves back to her hometown of Chicago and finds herself partnered with her former nemesis, John. Neither of them is happy to be working undercover together and find themselves falling right back into their old habit of competing over everything. I was laughing out loud, enjoying their snarky remarks and how they continually try to one-up each other. All the while, pretending to everyone else, they get along. As they work on the case, they grudgingly start to admire each other and find themselves having to fight their mutual attraction. \nI loved the chemistry between John and Jessica. They have a dry wit and there is a lot of verbal bantering and funny lines. Julie James has an easy, breezy, carefree style of writing that is so hard for most writers to achieve but she seems to do it effortlessly. I was immediately transported into John and Jessica\u2019s world and I never wanted to leave.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "uuid": "be66bf7afca0d4f34278f2c0b0b1a977ae45ce8d", "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "title": "Review: The Thing About Love by Julie James", "thread": {"country": "US", "site": "cocktailsandbooks.com", "replies_count": 0, "title_full": "Review: The Thing About Love by Julie James", "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 0, "section_title": "Cocktails and Books", "domain_rank": null, "uuid": "be66bf7afca0d4f34278f2c0b0b1a977ae45ce8d", "main_image": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1467222882l/27246123.jpg", "site_type": "blogs", "title": "Review: The Thing About Love by Julie James", "spam_score": 0.0, "site_section": "http://www.cocktailsandbooks.com/feed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.qTK8pmX2kDVRpyMSM5FbBXU1rZerkumcgR7SSQQHPWudQ3wgpqpqcFbftwA2AE_ovgiDwvr8YWx.DPTo_PWCpT9TRVb_sUAM-", "participants_count": 1, "site_full": "www.cocktailsandbooks.com", "social": {"linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "published": "2017-04-18T11:26:08.000+03:00"}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T11:26:08.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.qTK8pmX2kDVRpyMSM5FbBXU1rZerkumcgR7SSQQHPWudQ3wgpqpqcFbftwA2AE_ovgiDwvr8YWx.DPTo_PWCpT9TRVb_sUAM-", "highlightText": "", "published": "2017-04-18T11:26:08.000+03:00", "author": "Karen"}]
