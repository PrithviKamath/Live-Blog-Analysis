Even so, your\npremium may be lower than it otherwise would have been without our use of your credit history information. We look at\ncredit history information that helps us to measure your insurance risk; this information does not necessarily reflect your\ncredit worthiness. We evaluate your credit history information differently than a lender would. Therefore, it is possible to\nhave a very good credit score, yet still not be eligible for our absolute lowest premiums.\nWe did not give you our lowest possible premium due to the following information that we evaluated from your credit\nhistory:\n\u2022 The average open date of all your reported loans and accounts was less than 6 years ago.\n\u2022 Your most recent reported auto loan or lease was opened within the last year.\n\u2022 You applied for credit at least once in the last 2 years, excluding auto or mortgage applications.\nFor more information about our review and use of credit, refer to \"Why is credit history reviewed and used?\"\nWho took the action?\nThe action was taken by Progressive Direct Insurance Co, which underwrote, priced and issued the policy, using consumer\nreports obtained by Progressive Casualty Insurance Company.\nWho provided the information?\nCredit information for < only my name edited plus this sentence\nwas provided by:\nExperian\nTU fico08=817 3/24/17\nEX fico08=806 4/12/17\nEQ fico08=809 4/6/17\nGarden since 4/5/2017", "ord_in_thread": 3, "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://fico.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/2760iB9166C1A493A3CBC/image-size/original?v=1.0&px=-1"], "uuid": "a986b7dda85d6dd5d675ac3f0f091bc5d09f6668", "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "title": "", "thread": {"country": "US", "site": "myfico.com", "replies_count": 3, "title_full": "Is it okay to close 1 new card after getting 2? - Page 3 - myFICO\u00ae Forums", "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 0, "section_title": "Credit Cards - myFICO\u00ae Forums", "domain_rank": 8044, "uuid": "075e3da3a20026161d1cd05c96c689ccee8506e7", "main_image": "http://fico.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/26682i5B87487AD9B90C3B?v=1.0", "site_type": "discussions", "title": "Is it okay to close 1 new card after getting 2? - Page 3", "spam_score": 0.002, "site_section": "http://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/Credit-Cards/bd-p/creditcard", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxmlefHEBDqYEtkUGAfzGjbCajb.PR1_tftn.s5z3zBrdOi.JeAbTSlnf3gMQoKNJ96nY9A.1Y0gQY5TIJglSQBJ0k95sH9caxcMiQjnErEJwIQ3AgB4NhjBCwyhq88xotl2o18J2MWdA--", "participants_count": 3, "site_full": "ficoforums.myfico.com", "social": {"linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "published": "2017-04-18T02:25:00.000+03:00"}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T11:26:42.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxmlefHEBDqYEtkUGAfzGjbCajb.PR1_tftn.s5z3zBrdOi.JeAbTSlnf3gMQoKNJ96nY9A.1Y0gQY5TIJglSQBJ0k95sH9caxcMiQjnErEJwIQ3AgB4NhjBCwyhq88xov9Hgp.2afk5PVkPWVg0vEhyzBnnSYEPPs-", "highlightText": "", "published": "2017-04-18T04:51:00.000+03:00", "author": "sarge12"}]
