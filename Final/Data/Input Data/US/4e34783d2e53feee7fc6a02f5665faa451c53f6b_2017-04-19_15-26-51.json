This incident led to the passenger being treated in a very disrespectful manner after he refused to give up his seat. The mistreatment by the airline security officer made the matters worse when the passenger started bleeding and people started calling the airline out for discrimination against him because he was Asian.\nThe video became viral even in China with angry comments and posts regarding it from tens of thousands of users. The problem of the video going viral is still not over as the last article written about it, which is shown in the search results of Google, was published 1 hour ago.\nThe reason it got viral in the first place was because of the negative response it got, where people from different communities especially China came together to speak against this video on various social media platforms like twitter and Facebook. They talked about boycotting it and after the response of the company\u2019s Chief Executive Oscar Munoz, public outrage reached its peak\n\u201cThis is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers. Our team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened. \nIn this day and age where customer service and customer relationship management is of utmost importance for the company to succeed, a response like this let alone an incident which led to trauma for a customer is a big deal. This response was seen as being insensitive.\nCompanies try and put a face amongst its customers whereby the needs and wants of the customers are put in the highest regard so that they are able to sustain customers in this competitive environment. However, when it comes to United Airlines, that face which was presented in front of others was destroyed. Furthermore, they did not resolve the conflict by using a compromising communication style which they should have. Instead they put their needs above the needs of the customers. They preferred dragging the customers out to make space for their staff. The used a very dominating approach to resolve the matter whereby it seemed that they did the right thing.\nThe reach of the story seems to be very high. On Google news the first 12 pages (each page displaying 30 articles) is filled with news regarding this particular incident. Social mention site also shows a trending attitude towards this news. Sentiments on the site of United Airlines are as follows:\nPositive: 28\nNeutral:188\nNegative: 6\nThe exact words \u201cUnited Airline dragged passenger\u201d has 10% strength, 1:1 sentiments and 4% reach with 3 pages covering with news regarding the event.\nFurthermore, through Quintley we can access the various profiles and posts that have been made for United Airlines. Their Facebook page is filled with bad remarks and memes regarding the passenger being dragged out of the airline. There are negative reviews. There are also separate pages like New United Airlines Mottos & Memes dedicated to this. Moreover, on Instagram 4 out of 30 accounts about United Airlines exist with the aim to boycott United Airlines. Tweets using #NewUnitedAirlinesMottos, #UnitedAirlinesAssault and #UnitedAirlinesboycott are being used by a lot of users. The top ones as per the metions website are as follows:\n \n\nThis incident unfolded on Sunday, 9 th of April and since then it has been trending. It became viral the very same day, with the news reaching the internet within hours. The rising searches as per Google trends is shown below:\n\n \nThis incident, in terms of how the customer service of United Airlines is, reflects a very negative image which is similar to how the problem with Dave Caroll rolled out. However, in my opinion it is much worse than that since a customer rather than his belongings was physically hurt in this case.\nThe reaction from the company was as casual as it was in the case of Dave Caroll and it was only after the news escalated quickly leading to bad publicity to a great extent that the company apologized. Their response in both cases reflected negligence, a much laid back attitude towards customer care and also showed that their ease was put before their customers. Gauging from this incident, they did not learn much about controlling bad publicity as in both cases the news got viral. Their response was slow in both cases and one can say that their customer service hasn\u2019t improved since then due to such events not being taken care of. What they need is good customer management system, trained staff to cater to the needs of the passengers and a good PR team."}]
