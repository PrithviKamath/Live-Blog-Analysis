Narasimhan expects CTL019 to eventually top $1 billion in sales for multiple cancer types and also has high hopes for his NASH treatments, in particular in concert with other companies. \n\"Collaboration is key to developing the best possible treatments that are urgently needed for NASH patients,\" Narasimhan said in a statement. \nLate last year, Novartis struck a $50 million licensing deal with Conatus Pharmaceuticals for a separate treatment for NASH, an area that has also been tagged as a focus by industry rivals including Gilead and Bristol-Myers Squibb. \nCTL019 previously won accelerated FDA review for treating young people with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). \nLast month, Novartis submitted CTL019 for FDA review in young ALL patients as it races rivals including Kite Pharma to become the first to secure regulators' approval for a CAR-T treatment, where T cells are removed from patients, re-engineered to fight their cancers, then reinfused.
