Safe, shout fans at Dodger Stadium who see replays on the board. \nUmpires go to their headsets for a video review, and nearly three minutes later, the signal comes: Out! \nWant to hear exactly how disputed calls get decided, like that one in last year\u2019s NL Championship Series? \nSoon, we might. \nWhile nothing is set, Major League Baseball and umps are expected to discuss a plan \u2013 most prominently used in the NFL \u2013 for crew chiefs to wear a microphone and explain replay rulings. \nUnder one possible scenario, they would start at the All-Star Game on July 11 in Miami, tweak the process over the season\u2019s second half and then go forward with the experiment in the playoffs. \nPeople familiar with the talks spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because an agreement has not yet been reached. \nLast year, MLB asked for the plate ump to wear a mic at the All-Star Game, but there wasn\u2019t enough time to do it. \nThe umpires are in the middle of their five-year labor deal and any change would involve negotiations, plus a comfort level on both sides that the system would be efficient, accurate and easy. \nSo no way to say for sure if fans at Camden Yards, Coors Field and ballparks across the majors will become familiar with the voices of veteran crew chiefs \u2013 be it country singer Joe West, ordained minister Ted Barrett or Dale Scott, once a Top 40 AM radio disc jockey. \n\u201dIt probably would be nice to get a little more explanation,\u201d Marlins reliever Brad Ziegler said. \u201dThey\u2019re supposed to say the call stands or the call\u2019s confirmed. `The call stands\u2019 means you can\u2019t tell. A lot of times we don\u2019t get that \u2026 they just signal out or safe. That\u2019s all we get on the field. \n\u201dThey may announce it on the PA, but it doesn\u2019t seem like that is consistent in all parks. And the acoustics in the stadium here \u2013 we have a hard time hearing what\u2019s on the PA in the bullpen,\u201d he said. \nIn the NFL, hearing refs announce \u201dupon further review\u201d has long been part of the lexicon. The lore includes what Ben Dreith said in a 1986 game, when Jets lineman Marty Lyons tangled with Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly and was penalized for \u201dgiving him the business down there.\u201d \nThe NHL for some time has mic\u2019ed up officials to explain coach\u2019s challenges, based on what the central replay booth tells them. \nNBA crew chiefs put on headsets to watch reviews and talk with the replay center. Decisions are explained to the official scorer\u2019s table and the benches, and the public address announcers inform the crowd. \nMLB has tried to speed up reviews this year, aiming for the umpires in the New York replay booth to relay the final calls to the field in under 2 minutes. \n\u201dIt\u2019ll take more time,\u201d Boston pitcher David Price said. \u201dIt\u2019s not going to make them any shorter.\u201d \nAs for making the replay system more informative and entertaining, \u201dYeah, until they have a problem with the umpire\u2019s mic,\u201d he said. \nMarlins star Christian Yelich said a switch wouldn\u2019t affect him. \n\u201dThe call\u2019s the call,\u201dhe said. \u201dJust because they tell you what they decided isn\u2019t going to change it.\u201d \n\u2014", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "uuid": "49e11214afc87af210d1e850e077f4407f15c123", "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "title": "When fans see red, MLB men in blue may soon explain replays", "thread": {"country": "US", "site": "foxsports.com", "replies_count": 0, "title_full": "When fans see red, MLB men in blue may soon explain replays", "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 0, "section_title": "FOX Sports Digital", "domain_rank": 1307, "uuid": "49e11214afc87af210d1e850e077f4407f15c123", "main_image": "http://b.fssta.com/uploads/2016/12/default_image.vresize.1200.630.high.0.png", "site_type": "blogs", "title": "When fans see red, MLB men in blue may soon explain replays", "spam_score": 0.0, "site_section": "http://api.foxsports.com/v1/rss?partnerKey=zBaFxRyGKCfxBagJG9b8pqLyndmvo7UU", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9PE40TWYHM8XZjkxh3YXvzmKqgD4ZRdp4mB.WbAvQGS4DKnBHnux0o8pD1QLijNAph9ig2a.zlv8FO51KDrcc17t4R6nUcPjveAviH1pIau4vXd2.eDOWypc_2elwwQ4o-", "participants_count": 0, "site_full": "www.foxsports.com", "social": {"linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "published": "2017-04-18T11:24:52.000+03:00"}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T11:24:52.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9PE40TWYHM8XZjkxh3YXvzmKqgD4ZRdp4mB.WbAvQGS4DKnBHnux0o8pD1QLijNAph9ig2a.zlv8FO51KDrcc17t4R6nUcPjveAviH1pIau4vXd2.eDOWypc_2elwwQ4o-", "highlightText": "", "published": "2017-04-18T11:24:52.000+03:00", "author": ""}]
