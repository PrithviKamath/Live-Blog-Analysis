That year, he underwent surgery for a tumour on his lung. With the exception of a three-year stint as ITN\u2019s political editor, he has worked for the BBC since 1986. He recently started a weekly podcast called Political Thinking .\nOne reason your doctor tested you for cancer was because you\u2019d lost weight and got yourself a new slimline suit. Does it still fit?\nIt\u2019s my favourite, but it only fits because secretly, after I had my cancer treatment, I had an inch let out of the waist. Normally, you\u2019d be depressed as a middle-aged guy to have an inch let out on your suit. I have to say it felt like a doubly good moment.\nYour vocal cords were damaged during surgery and you\u2019ve undergone a lot of speech therapy. How is the voice now?\nIt\u2019s almost there. Physically, it will never be quite the same as it was. There was damage to the laryngeal nerve that connects to your vocal cords. We\u2019ve all only got two of them and if one doesn\u2019t work, well, that\u2019s a problem. Anyway, it\u2019s working a lot better and it\u2019s only noticeable to other people when I\u2019ve got a bad cold or am very tired. I used to have to wake up and put my head under a towel with lots of steam and make funny noises, miaowing like a cat. Now I\u2019m pretty much behaving like everyone else .\nHaving been through your cancer experience and witnessed the death of your good friend Steve Hewlett , how do you think the health system could improve cancer treatment?\nI did a feature about that for the Today programme. The NHS has been much less successful at catching cancer early. Generally, the treatment people have after they realise they\u2019ve got cancer has been good in this country, but we\u2019re much too slow to catch it. The figures are really quite shocking. Thousands would live each year if we treated people with cancer as well as they do in Holland, Belgium, France or Germany. The key thing is to get people diagnosed much quicker.\nWe too rarely come across stuff that makes us reconsider, or at least flesh out our view\nHow has having cancer affected your outlook as a journalist and in life in general?\nIt made me realise how many people have their own experience of serious illness, either themselves or close family. People come up to you all the time and tell you: \u201cI\u2019ve got cancer\u201d or: \u201cMy wife has\u201d. It really underlined to me that there is a value in talking about it. Not for look-at-me reasons, but because people draw comfort from the fact that other people are having experiences like the ones they\u2019re going through; it reduces one of the hardest thing about serious illness, which is the loneliness of it.\nDo you ever get used to getting up at 3.30am (to work on Today )?\nI think you can learn to live with it rather than get used to it. One doctor very helpfully said to me: \u201cYou do realise that more people die at that time than any other\u2026\u201d The time between three and four is a low for the body and that\u2019s when lots of people take their last breath. I joke sometimes that I\u2019ve never worked fewer hours, which is technically true, but I\u2019m knackered a lot of the time because it gives you a kind of jetlag getting up at this time of the day.\nWhy did you want to return to radio?\nThe reason I wanted to be a journalist \u2013 there\u2019s nobody from that background in my family \u2013 was because my best friend\u2019s dad , Brian Redhead, was presenter of the Today programme. That\u2019s where I got the bug. The first job I ever did as a journalist was on radio. The joy of radio is that it\u2019s much less mannered and much less theatrical than telly. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love TV. For impact, it beats everything. But there is a sort of artificiality about television. I often think that people on TV \u2013 and I include myself in this \u2013 look as if we\u2019re impersonating people appearing on television. With the job I\u2019m doing now, it feels like you\u2019re having a chat. That\u2019s lovely.\nYou were in last week\u2019s Spectator debating bias over Brexit at the BBC. Do you feel the BBC is an organisation that comes in for too much criticism?\nYou can never criticise too much an organisation that takes a lot of public money and has a privileged position. Everyone has to pay the license fee. We get a couple billion quid of public money, so we\u2019ve got to take criticism, but equally we\u2019ve got to stand up to it when it\u2019s unfair and doesn\u2019t have a proper basis. We\u2019re in unchartered terrritory with Brexit, and most people, including me, didn\u2019t see the results coming. So, boy, do we have to look at ourselves and ask ourselves tough questions about whether we\u2019re interviewing the right people, asking the right questions.\nYour podcast, Political Thinking, allows for some in-depth debate. Are you persuaded by what people say or are your views already established?\nI think you\u2019re always shaping them. We all come with our own prejudices to all subjects. The joy of doing a longer discussion is that you discover things you didn\u2019t know. The danger with short conversations \u2013 social media has made everything boil down to 140 characters or a headline \u2013 is that we too rarely come across stuff that makes us reconsider or at least flesh out our view. One of the reasons I wanted to do these discussions was that politicians often complained to me that there was no real value in them thinking out loud because they just got pounced on by journalists like me.\nJeremy Paxman famously said of interviewing politicians that he wanted to find out why these bastards were lying to him. Do you think that aggressive style of questioning has had its day?\nI\u2019m a great Paxman fan, personally and professionally, but it\u2019s one of the few things Jeremy said that I didn\u2019t just disagree with but loathed. I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re sitting there lying and I don\u2019t want to convey to the public that they\u2019re lying. I\u2019m quite unfashionable among journalists, maybe among people. In the classic conversation in the back of a cab, where people say they\u2019re all liars and on the take, I\u2019m afraid that cab drivers find themselves having their ears bent my me, saying that is not true, it\u2019s lazy, it\u2019s cheap and it\u2019s just the way to guarantee that we have worse people doing these important jobs.\nYou studied PPE at Oxford. In a recent Guardian piece, Andy Beckett suggested PPE graduates run Britain. Do you agree?\nIf you\u2019re not in the PPE club, people might think it is literally that: a funny handshake, knowing look and secret membership card. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s made a lot of difference to what I\u2019ve done or achieved, save this: I think PPE is probably the degree for people who are great on their feet or, to put it another way, great bullshitters.\nWhat are you reading?\nFrank Gardner, the BBC security correspondent, has a thriller out [ Crisis ] which is a cracking read and has that insider\u2019s feel. I\u2019ve gone back to thrillers. I was a big thriller reader as a kid and then gave it up. Sometimes, when I\u2019m trying to distract myself, my wife jokes that I need endless plot. So it\u2019s a bit of endless plot I\u2019m after.\nYou\u2019re a Manchester United fan. What\u2019s the verdict on Jos\u00e9 Mourinho?\nHe\u2019s making United good to watch again, but it\u2019s a pity about the results. For the past few seasons, I wasn\u2019t sure if I was pleased to be going to Old Trafford or pleased to be not going. I now love going again because there\u2019s excitement and buzz, particularly because of Zlatan [Ibrahimovi\u0107] \u2013 but, boy, does he need to get someone else scoring and a few more wins.\nPolitical Thinking is available to download weekly at bbc.co.uk\nTopics Nick Robinson The New Review Q&A Cancer Radio 4 BBC Radio industry Jeremy Paxman interviews Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nIlGLQMub.V2.KfNvj6F4.0mHyDA9hQDytHi2XQN3XgLSzhWA2ifUZBFkVWCvm.sQVtRMfPGjVFUyIpALCYS9FgT7BeZLAylhfKJbaf7_4_pBFV2eK6lS5w--", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T11:30:38.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "Nick Robinson: \u2018The BBC gets a lot of public money \u2013 we have to take criticism\u2019 | Media", "thread": {"title_full": "Nick Robinson: \u2018The BBC gets a lot of public money \u2013 we have to take criticism\u2019 | Media | The Guardian", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss", "performance_score": 3, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 330, "shares": 330, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": 170, "replies_count": 3, "site_categories": [], "country": "US", "section_title": "The Guardian", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nIlGLQMub.V2.KfNvj6F4.0mHyDA9hQDytHi2XQN3XgLSzhWA2ifUZBFkVWCvm.sQVtRMfPGjVFUyIpALCYS9FgT7BeZLAylhfKJbaf7_4_pBFV2eK6lS5w--", "published": "2017-04-16T11:30:38.000+03:00", "title": "Nick Robinson: \u2018The BBC gets a lot of public money \u2013 we have to take criticism\u2019 | Media", "uuid": "bcf73f2f14cf6523c0669e04c330b5581da7d042", "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8490fda8fa307b80aea366db4c64bb45cf372fc1/0_225_4870_2921/master/4870.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=cb8e2a343f47ff0041e5ac5de6389f22"}, "uuid": "bcf73f2f14cf6523c0669e04c330b5581da7d042", "ord_in_thread": 0}]
