She says the halibut quota is 150 tonnes, but 50 tonnes right off the top is being provided to the FFAW for research, and harvesters want to know why.

DFO Officials Hold \u2018Substantive\u2019 Meeting with Gillett, Cleary \nDFO says senior regional officials had what it\u2019s calling a \u201csubstantive\u201d meeting with Richard Gillett and Ryan Cleary yesterday. \nIn a released statement, DFO says Fisheries Minister Dominic LeBlanc has been kept apprised of the situation and Gillett\u2019s hunger strike. \nThe department says fisheries management decisions are made in a transparent manner with fish harvesters at the table with scientists when reviewing the state of fish stocks. \nIt says management decisions are evidence-based with the ultimate goal to conserve public resources for use now and in future generations. \nIt says as far as the relationship between DFO and the FFAW goes, the certification process of bargaining agents is the decision of harvesters in conjunction with provincial legislation and DFO works with whomever harvesters choose to represent them.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:24:30.000+03:00"}]
