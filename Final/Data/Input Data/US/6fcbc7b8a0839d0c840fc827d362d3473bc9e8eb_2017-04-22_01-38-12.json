Following this weekend's Caliph-for-Life referendum, the Turk is sicker than ever. But he's no longer of Europe, and instead is exiting for a destination dark and catastrophic for almost all his neighbors. Sultan Erdo\u011fan - who, a mere 15 years ago, was banned from holding political office - has now succeeded in dismantling almost every defining element of the Kemalist republic. What replaces it will be a crude strongman state in service of Islamic imperialism. I have read a lot of commentary this morning, starting with Douglas Murray's \" Turkish Democracy Has Just Died \" and moving on to Yavuz Baydar's \" The End Of Turkey As We Know It \" via Alex Alexiev's \" Who Lost Turkey? \" And several readers have been kind enough to inquire where's my own \"Who Lost Turkey?\" piece.

In other words, the Zionist Entity's best pal is starting to look like just another cookie-cutter death-to-the-Great-Satan stan-of-the-month. In fairness to the new Caliph, ever since he emerged from his semi-pro footballing career to run for Mayor of Istanbul, he's played a more cunning game than the stan-of-the-month loons. ... -go to links-", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "6fcbc7b8a0839d0c840fc827d362d3473bc9e8eb", "highlightText": "", "rating": null}]
