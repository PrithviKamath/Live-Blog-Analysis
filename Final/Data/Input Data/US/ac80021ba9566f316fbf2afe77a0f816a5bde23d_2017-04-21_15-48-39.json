We took a closer look at Advantage Garcinia ingredients, side effects, and clinical research. Then, we read tons of product reviews on the supplement. Finally, we gathered all the facts to give you the bottom line. Advantage Garcinia Readers:   Leptigen. What is Advantage Garcinia? \nFirst off, Advantage Garcinia is a weight-loss support supplement that contains hydroxycitric acid, a chemical component in Garcinia cambogia. You are supposed to consume one capsule a day about thirty minutes before breakfast. It is also suggested that you continue to use for three to four months to see accurate results, which is a good suggestion. \nThe company that produces Advantage Garcinia is unknown, but we do know that their official website was created in 2016. They offer a risk-free trial and include a video about the science behind hydroxycitric acid, but read on\u2026 Is this another garcinia cambogia supplement making extraordinary claims? Ineffective \u2013 \u201cDoes It Work Effectively?\u201d \nThe first thing we noticed with Advantage Garcinia was its lack of effectiveness. \u201cWhen people start spending their money on supplements, and they don\u2019t work, that is a real problem,\u201d said our Research Editor. \u201cIf this is true for Advantage Garcinia, then dieters will quickly cease usage.\u201d \n\u201cThere is no appetite loss using this product,\u201d a review said. \n\u201cI am seeing no positive effects\u2026\u201d another said. \nSome consumers found the supplement worked just fine. \n\u201cI have been taking [this] for months\u2026It [worked] within a couple of days, and the results are amazing,\u201d one consumer wrote. \n\u201cHave been taking [this for] little over a month\u2026does [suppress] appetite\u2026noticed weight loss in face and stomach\u2026[going to] continue\u2026\u201d mentioned another. Scroll   Advantage Garcinia Side Effects \u2013 \u201cWhat Are the Reactions?\u201d \nThe second issue we found were customer complaints of Advantage Garcinia side effects. \nOne user wrote, \u201cWithin 30 minutes I began to feel light headed, weak and dizzy. I began vomiting, and my stomach was very [queasy] all day.\u201d \n\u201cThis has caused constipation, bloating, fatigue and increased appetite,\u201d wrote another. \nOther people did not experience any adverse reactions while using Advantage Garcinia. \n\u201cNo side effects and I are surprised since I am prone to headaches,\u201d one dieter said. \nAnother customer wrote in a review, \u201cI have not noticed any side effects and am truly satisfied with this product. I\u2026recommended this product to several of my friends.\u201d \nAfter years of experience with dietary supplements, we have found it can take something that seems small to ruin the chance of long-term results. If Advantage Garcinia is ineffective and causes adverse reactions, that could be an issue. The Science \u2013 \u201cAre the Studies Enough?\u201d \nWhen researching Garcinia cambogia, we found many studies. However, many of them did not indicate its ability to induce weight-loss effects on the consumer. Additionally, Advantage Garcinia makes many claims about their supplement without pointing to any research to back them up. Instead, their official website only includes a video explaining the \u201cscience\u201d behind hydroxycitric acid. Before recommending any product, we like to see an ample amount of research. There doesn\u2019t seem to be enough evidence for us to recommend Advantage Garcinia to you.   Advantage Garcinia Work? \nAre we racing out for some Advantage Garcinia? Well, we like that the formula includes a researched component and that the company offers a free trial offer. We do have some reservations about this one due to reports of adverse reactions and ineffectiveness. There is the issue with the lack of research connecting it to weight-loss. \nIf you want to lose weight, we suggest using a product backed science and shown to works \n  we\u2019ve seen this year is one called Leptigen . Its formula includes four clinically researched components that can help jumpstart the metabolism and reduce appetite. User testimonials around the web indicate that people see great results. \nThere is also a Special Trial Offer for all new customers, which seems like a great opportunity.
