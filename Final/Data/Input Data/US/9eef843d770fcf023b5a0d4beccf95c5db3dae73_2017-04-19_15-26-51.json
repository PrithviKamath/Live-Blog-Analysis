Photo: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty Images North Korea did not celebrate its founder\u2019s birthday on Saturday by testing a new nuclear weapon, as many had feared it would. Instead the North Korean regime literally paraded its missiles through Pyongyang , including new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) systems that arms experts had never seen before. North Korea conducted a missile test on Sunday, but it failed , according to military officials in the U.S. and South Korea. It was likely a medium-range missile, which exploded almost immediately after launch.\nDefense Secretary James Mattis responded to the launch on Saturday night (U.S. time), seemingly speaking for the president and White House.\u201cThe president and his military team are aware of North Korea\u2019s most recent unsuccessful missile launch,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe president has no further comment.\u201d\nA White House official told the New York Times that while President Trump has many options available, he probably won\u2019t respond to North Korea\u2019s failed missile launch. \u201cIf it had been a nuclear test, then other actions would have been taken from the U.S.,\u201d the official said.\nVice-President Mike Pence called the test a \u201cprovocation\u201d when he arrived in South Korea on Sunday at the start of a four-nation Asia tour. Then, during a surprise visit to the Demilitarized Zone on Monday, Pence called the U.S. alliance with South Korea \u201cironclad,\u201d and said North Korea \u201cshould not mistake the resolve of the United States of America to stand with our allies.\u201d\n\u201c[T]he era of strategic patience is over,\u201d Pence said. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out and we want to see change. We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable.\u201d\nRelated Stories The Problem With Trump\u2019s Attempt to Scare North Korea Sunday\u2019s missile test was North Korea\u2019s fifth of the year. The reason it blew up is unknown, but such failures are a regular outcome for the regime. The Times reported that the U.S. began conducting a covert electronic war against North Korea\u2019s missile program three years ago, though the extent of its success is not clear. President Obama apparently accelerated the program last year, and the Times notes that there has been a corresponding increase in the failure rate of North Korea\u2019s tests since then.\nThe large collection of missile systems displayed during Saturday\u2019s parade in Pyongyang still alarmed arms and nonproliferation experts. There were both new configurations of existing missile systems, as well as what appeared to be two new canister ICBM launching systems that may have held new ICBMs.\nWhatever the canisters contained, the regime was clearly trying to demonstrate that, as it has repeatedly promised, it is developing long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles that are capable of hitting the U.S., as well as missiles that utilize solid-fuel technology, which would enable North Korea to more easily transport and hide its missiles and launch them with less warning to international monitors.\nTurns out the submarine-launched ballistic missile wasn't the big unveil. This is: pic.twitter.com/s2mNBMuON2 \n\u2014 Martyn Williams (@martyn_williams) April 15, 2017 N.Korea showcases probable intercontinental ballistic missiles at massive military parade https://t.co/OevF5NYsQs pic.twitter.com/c4KVjfdmAx \n\u2014 NK NEWS (@nknewsorg) April 16, 2017 Ultimately, the regime is trying to convince the world that it possesses second-strike capability, or will soon \u2014 which means that it would be able to respond to any first strike on North Korea with a devastating counterattack on the U.S. or its allies in the region, possibly including a nuclear-weapon payload.\nSome experts warn that appearances can be deceiving, especially when it comes to North Korea. For instance, it\u2019s possible that the country was only displaying mock-ups of new ICBM systems on Saturday, rather than the functioning, or near-functioning, weapons themselves.\nRegardless, analysts seem to agree that the world should be concerned about what Saturday\u2019s parade said about North Korea\u2019s gains and goals. Even if the regime was only displaying mock-ups, they show what North Korea intends to build, and that the government has made progress toward that aim. As one surprised nonproliferation analyst commented in response to the parade:\nThis is a lot of new stuff for a country with an economy 1/4 of Ethiopia to suddenly pull out of a hat.\n\u2014 Kyle Mizokami (@KyleMizokami) April 15, 2017 Another expert, Duyeon Kim, explained to the Japan Times that North Korea\u2019s missile pageant was meant to send \u201ca message to its own citizens and the international community that the regime is \u2018powerful,\u2019 has made \u2018leaps\u2019 in technological advancements and will not cave under U.S. pressure.\u201d\nIn an interview with NPR, Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, added:\nI think in the United States we sort of laugh at [the North Korean regime]. We treat them like they\u2019re a little bit of a joke, but they don\u2019t think they\u2019re a joke. And I think the North Koreans long ago concluded that their weapons programs are a way of getting us to take them seriously. And so I think a lot of times, we have expectations for the North Koreans, and the North Koreans like to defy those expectations. They like to show us that they\u2019re serious about this, that they really can do this and that if there is a joke, it\u2019s on us, not them. In Lewis\u2019s opinion, the regime may have shown as many as three new ICBM systems on Saturday, and the overall demonstration was \u201cbewildering\u201d to him and other experts. While there have been many stumbles along the way, North Korea has continued to develop the weapons technology they see as integral to their survival.\nOn the other hand, the regime has never successfully tested a long-range ICBM that could reach the U.S. It\u2019s unclear if the regime has been able to build a nuclear warhead small enough to mount on a missile or to survive reentry from space.\nMore ballistic missiles on display during the Day of the Sun parade. Photo: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images Aside from the new ICBM canisters, many of the rocket and missile systems on display during the parade on Saturday did not appear to be new; some were just variations of older models, or weapons that had been reconfigured or cosmetically altered. The regime unveiled two solid-fuel missiles, which have been tested but never before seen: a submarine-launched ballistic missile (with an intermediate range of 600 miles) that the country tested last year, and a similar land-based version that the North Koreans launched into the Sea of Japan in February. Most of North Korea\u2019s missiles run on liquid fuel, which means they have to be fueled before firing, making the launches slower and missile systems easier to detect. Solid fuel missiles are preloaded and ready to fire, require a smaller fleet of support vehicles, and can be stored on submarines or easily hidden mobile launchers.\nAmid the still-heightening tensions between North Korea and the U.S., The Diplomat \u2019s Ankit Panda sees the new missile systems, whether they are ready to use or not, as an ominous development :\n[M]ore so than ever, North Korea seems to be highlighting the perils of a preemptive first strike to the United States and South Korea. With every nuclear and ballistic missile test, its threat of inflicting unacceptable retaliatory damage against Seoul and, eventually, Washington becomes more credible.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, we\u2019re likely still in for a sixth nuclear test sooner or later. Even though Pyongyang withheld from testing this weekend amid rumors of possible retaliation by the United States, North Korea is still looking to improve its missile know-how. Moreover, the long-dreaded ICBM flight test also might not be too far off now. Given the ever-growing number of TELs \u2014 both wheeled and tracked \u2014 North Korea may soon field nuclear forces amply large that a conventional U.S.-South Korea first strike may find it impossible to fully disarm Pyongyang of a nuclear retaliatory capability. That would give the North Korean regime what it\u2019s always sought with its nuclear and ballistic missile program: an absolute guarantee against coercive removal.
