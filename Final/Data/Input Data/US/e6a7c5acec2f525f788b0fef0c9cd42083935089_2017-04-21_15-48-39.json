Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, on Tuesday asked the General Accountability Office to review tax-time financial services used by millions of Americans. \nIn a letter to the GAO, Warren, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat of Illinois, and Sen. Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, asked the government watchdog to examine the scope and impact of tax-time financial products by companies such as Intuit Inc. INTU, +0.60% parent of TurboTax, and H&R Block HRB, +0.59% , including whether fees they charge are \u201creasonable and transparent.\u201d \nThe senators also raised concerns about possible excessive fees for refund-related products. \nThey cited the growing use of \u201crefund anticipation checks,\u201d a temporary bank account set up so that the IRS can directly deposit a refund into the account. Tax preparation fees, plus a fee for the account setup, are then deducted by firms. \nThese checks cost consumers an average of $25 to $60 for federal refunds and were the source of $648 million in taxpayer fees in 2014, the letter said. The checks have replaced refund anticipation loans, which were subjected to a government crackdown over their fees. \nOpinion: The share of tax dollars coming from you is growing \u2014 and the share from companies is shrinking \nLast week Warren introduced legislation calling for the Internal Revenue Service to establish a free online tax preparation and filing service that would effectively cut out the middleman firms. \n\u201cThe tax preparation industry wants to keep Americans locked into a difficult and expensive tax-filing process \u2014 that\u2019s how they turn big profits,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \nDon\u2019t miss: Americans get an \u2018F\u2019 on income tax quiz \nFor its part, H&R Block said in a statement it \u201cwelcomes independent review of any of our products and services.\u201d \nThe company said it was \u201cproud\u201d to provide clients a variety of products and services at tax time and beyond.
