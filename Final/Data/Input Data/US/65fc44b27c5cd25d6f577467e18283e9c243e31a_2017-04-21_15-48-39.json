We find out by picking apart the side effects, clinical research, and ingredients. Additionally, we read hundreds of user comments to get their take. In the end, we gathered all of the information to give you the details you are looking for. Metabo Slimax Readers:   Leptigen. What is Metabo Slimax? \nTo begin, Metabo Slimax is an appetite suppressant and metabolism booster. The ingredients may include hydroxycitric acid, although there is no official ingredient list for the supplement. The website suggests taking one capsule about an hour before a meal twice a day for 90 days to see real results. The product claims to contain no chemicals, fillers, or binders, which is a positive. \nWe are not sure about the company behind Metabo Slimax. However, we do know that the official website was created in 2016. It seems like the supplement is available on many online retail stores, which is a good thing but read on\u2026 No more appetite. Enhanced metabolics. Increased energy? Is Metabo Slimax for real? Ineffective \u2013 \u201cDoes the Supplement Produce Results?\u201d \nThe first problem we discovered with Metabo Slimax was the lack of effectiveness with the supplement. \u201cA major issue we have found with many dietary products is their lack of ability to work,\u201d said our Research Editor. \u201cIf this is the case with Metabo Slimax, they have a real issue on their hands.\u201d \n\u201cTook it for two months it did not do anything for me, ended up tossing the final bottle,\u201d one review said. \nAnother customer had a similar experience, saying, \u201cDidn\u2019t work. I purchased it along with Puremax. Waste of money.\u201d \nAfter weeks of research, we could not find a single review claiming the product to work efficiently. \nScroll below for one of the best products we have seen this year. Scroll   Bad Business \u2013 \u201cWhat\u2019s the Real Price of Metabo Slimax?\u201d \nThe second issue we found with Metabo Slimax was the price. According to many reviews, customers seem to have problems with being charged for supplements and trial offers they didn\u2019t sign up for. \nOne individual said, \u201cThey charged my account two times in two months of $130, and I called three times, and they won\u2019t refund me. They took money from me after I canceled it.\u201d \nAnother agreed, saying, \u201c\u2026this company has charged me 69.95 and refuses to refund my account and keeps hanging up on me. I did not agree to any membership or to pay 69.95 for a bottle of green tea pills.\u201d \nWe could not find any positive reviews concerning their prices. \nAfter researching supplements for many years, we at DietSpotlight found that it can take something that seems irrelevant to ruin the chance of real weight-loss. If Metabo Slimax doesn\u2019t work and has unreliable prices, then there is a big problem. The Science \u2013 \u201cIs There Any Evidence?\u201d \nAlthough plenty of research has been done with hydroxycitric acid, we are not sure that the ingredient is present in Metabo Slimax. Without an official ingredient list, we can\u2019t be sure whether or not science backs up the supplement. Before we support any product, we like to see some evidence that it works. In this case, there doesn\u2019t seem to be enough.   Metabo Slimax Work? \nAre we racing out to buy some Metabo Slimax? Well, we like that the product seems to contain no harmful components and it is readily available online, which we like. However, we have some reservations about the supplement, especially concerning its effectiveness and faulty pricing. For these reasons, we\u2019re hesitant to recommend it. \nIf you want to get rid of that weight once and for all, we believe dieters should focus on a diet supplement that works at a price you can trust. \n  we\u2019ve seen this year is Leptigen . The ingredient list contains four scientifically researched components that can help jumpstart metabolic rate and fight cravings. Reviews and comments around the web suggest that it is indeed effective. \nThe company is so confident in their product that they are providing a Special Trial Offer for a limited time for all new customers.
