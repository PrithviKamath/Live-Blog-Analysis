But their romance can only last as long as vacation.\nOr so she thinks.\nA twist of fate\u2014well, her Dad opening another brewery in a new town\u2014lands her in Blake\u2019s school, but the charismatic boy she fell for wants nothing to do with her, and worse, the Snow Bunnies, the popular clique, claim her as their newest recruit.\nCally must learn to be true to herself\u2014all while landing a spot on the ski team and figuring out who she is without her old friends. And when she finds out what Blake is hiding, she learns the rules on the slopes apply to more than just skiing.\nAdd to Goodreads \nBuy Links: Print / Amazon / BN / Kobo / Smashwords / iBooks \nEXCERPT: \nI double check that Blake is still in line for hot chocolate, then whip out my phone and fire off a text to Sophia. Found a hottie. Made contact. \nMy good knee bounces in time to my heart, which hasn\u2019t settled since Blake deposited me in a chair near the fireplace and pulled off his helmet, revealing shaggy brown hair that falls just above his crazy-blue eyes. The image in my head of us sipping hot chocolate next to the fire is beyond corny, but who am I to argue when they were the only open chairs.\nMy phone vibrates. Spill. \nMajor wipeout. He came to my rescue. Carried me into the lodge. \nI check his progress in line and shake my head. What universe have I landed in where the hottest guy here\u2014and the nicest, and not to mention a kickass boarder\u2014is trying to impress me? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m not interested in boys, but I\u2019ve always been so focused on skiing that by middle school I wedged myself in as one of the guys and now it\u2019s too late to change it. The few dates I\u2019ve been on were with boys outside my circle and they always get scared off once they meet my pack of friends and see how protective they are of me.\nAnd you\u2019re having his babies when? \nI snort just as Blake sits in the chair next to me. \u201cWas it something I said?\u201d\n\u201cSorry! It\u2019s my friend. She\u2019s a little\u2026 never mind.\u201d I tuck my phone into my coat pocket and take a Styrofoam cup from him. Our fingers graze and a little zing of electricity rockets up my arm and straight into my belly. I clear my throat, hoping he doesn\u2019t notice that I can\u2019t seem to speak.\nHe sets a bag of ice on the table, slides another chair close to me so I can prop up my leg, and sits in the chair next to me. I grab the bag and roll the ice around to break up any chunks, then plop it on my knee. I should really pull up my snowpants for the ice to help, but the bunny long underwear is staying in hibernation.\nOnce he\u2019s sure I\u2019m situated, he leans forward so his elbows are on the table and points one finger like he\u2019s counting. \u201cSo here\u2019s what I know. You\u2019re one of the best trick skiers I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He points a second finger. \u201cYou\u2019re here with your dad and\u2026?\u201d His head tilts as he waits for me to reply.\n\u201cJust my dad.\u201d\nHe points the third finger. \u201cAnd you\u2019re gorgeous. Now this would be enough for your average snowboarding fool, but I want to know more.\u201d\nWho talks like that? I look around, expecting people to be staring, but no one\u2019s paying attention to us. \u201cAm I being punked?\u201d\nHe furrows his brows. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never once had anyone say something like that to me. I figure it must be a joke.\u201d\nA blush creeps up his cheeks and he pushes his hair off his forehead. \u201cNo joke. I had a lot of time to think when you were with the ski patrol dude. But I mean it. The girls at my school are too worried about their hair to put on a helmet and pull the flip you did.\u201d\nI shrug. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t worry about those things.\u201d\nHe smiles and my belly does another somersault. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I want to know more about you. Where are you from?\u201d\nI take a deep breath and force myself to relax. While I don\u2019t want to fall into the friend zone with Blake, I know how to talk to guys. Pretend he\u2019s Hunter or Sam. \u201cI\u2019m from Vermont. South Burlington. I\u2019m on the ski team and wasn\u2019t supposed to try that last trick without my coach, but the powder here is so different from back home I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d I glance out the window in the direction of the scene of my crash and smile. \u201cHe\u2019ll be happy you forced me onto the sled.\u201d\nHis dimple deepens. \u201cRight place, right time. So this is your first time in Colorado?\u201d\nI nod. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\nHis smile hardens for a millisecond, but it\u2019s back so fast I wonder if I imagined it. \u201cI\u2019m from Lake Tahoe. The California side.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, a Cali boy?\u201d\nHe rolls his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re not all bad.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m intrigued. Us east coast girls don\u2019t have too many run-ins with surfer boys.\u201d\nHe bites his lower lip. \u201cI don\u2019t surf. I live in the mountains.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I figured you\u2019re such a good snow boarder that you must surf in the summer.\u201d He\u2019s quiet, and I scramble for a new topic. I don\u2019t know what made him clam up, but I can\u2019t blow this in the first five minutes. \u201cHow long are you here for?\u201d\nThe tension in his shoulders relaxes and he leans back in his chair. \u201c\u2018Til Sunday.\u201d\n\u201cMe too.\u201d I can\u2019t stop the goofy smile that plasters itself to my face. I met this boy less than an hour ago and I\u2019m acting like we\u2019re already in love. Which makes my cheeks flame even hotter.\n\nAbout the Author \nWhile not a fan of matching Day-Glo outfits, Melanie\u2019s been skiing since she was five and always points her tips up while exiting the chairlift.
