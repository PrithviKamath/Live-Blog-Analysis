My 46mm is silver / black serial 227358 Thanks, GUB. I suspected that the lens review entry was wrong, but I only have one black preset 135mm Takumar. I'd be interested if you think the picture quality is different between the 49 and the 46mm versions. They have the same number of lens elements and aperture blades and are probably the same as far as lens coatings go, none or one, but you seemed to think smaller elements might have an effect. I hope the answer is there is no difference because I don't want to buy another lens."}]
