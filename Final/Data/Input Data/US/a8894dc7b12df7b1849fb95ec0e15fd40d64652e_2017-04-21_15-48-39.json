But he also sells tickets.\n\u201cBuilding the Wall,\u201d Pulitzer Prize winner Robert Schenkkan\u2019s new political play written in response to what he calls Trump\u2019s dangerous rhetoric and authoritarian tendencies, has become one of the best-selling shows in the 27-year history of the Fountain Theatre in Los Angeles, Artistic Director Stephen Sachs said.\nThe production has been selling out three weeks in advance, he said, and the Fountain announced Monday that it is extending the run through June 18 after originally planning to close May 21.\nTimes theater critic Charles McNulty described \"Building the Wall\" as an exploration of the banality of evil. Set in the near future, the Trump administration ratchets up the war against terrorism and permits the rounding up of immigrants, which leads to detention centers beset with managerial problems and inevitable human catastrophe.\nThe play does lapse into rhetoric, McNulty noted in his March 21 review , but \u201cthe theater historically has provided a forum for citizens to contemplate the agonizing issues of the day, and it's heartening to see Schenkkan and the Fountain respond with such celerity to present dangers.\u201d\nSIGN UP for the free Essential Arts & Culture newsletter \u00bb\nSchenkkan won the 1992 Pulitzer for drama for \u201cThe Kentucky Cycle\u201d and the 2014 Tony Award for best play for \u201cAll the Way.\u201d His credits also include the 2016 film \u201cHacksaw Ridge.\u201d The esteemed writer\u2019s track record and his choice of subjects for this latest world premiere have led to news coverage from the New York Times, Washington Post and BBC News Hour.\n\u201cBuilding the Wall\u201d is scheduled to open later this year in New York, Tucson and Denver, among other places. In Washington, D.C., a Forum Theatre production is set to begin performances April 27 in one of the Arena Stage\u2019s three theaters.\n\"We hope it triggers a flurry of midnight tweets from the White House,\u201d Sachs said. \u201cThat would be our most coveted review yet.\"\nCaption 'The Fate of the Furious' movie review by Justin Chang Justin Chang reviews \"The Fate of the Furious,\" directed by F.
