A dedicated sushi counter\u2019s been shoehorned inside what would be the hallway, and there\u2019s a pokey sit-down restaurant downstairs. It isn\u2019t the most comfortable place to sit, but it\u2019s worth the trouble for some of London\u2019s best sushi, which does both classics and new-school dishes very well. The lunchtime sushi sets and chirashi are a great deal, as you\u2019ll find the best stuff - even o-toro - mixed in there for the relative bargain of \u00a325. For dinner, Dinings is definitely one for the sushi enthusiasts, as a serious bill can rack up very, very quickly. Tell Your Friends"}]
