However, one thing I do know for sure is that this is the first time I have seen this product on sale! \nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with this item, now is a good chance to try it at a lower cost. With an established reputation and good reviews online (http://www.ytupaleta.com/), why not give it a shot? \nMobiSave and SavingStar \u2014 Many of the items on the chart have coupon matchups with MobiSave (http://www.mobisave.com/) and SavingStar (https://savingstar.com/coupons). Although I have included these online rebate programs in deal summaries before, I never made a point of highlighting these options until now. \nLike Ibotta and Checkout51, these cash back programs credit you when you submit your receipts online. What makes me like MobiSave and SavingStar more is that they have more matchups that work at Lubbock retailers. For our area, I consider Ibotta and Checkout51 to be a triumph of hope over experience. \nDr. Oetker Virtuoso Pizza \u2014 In psychology, cognitive dissonance is the discomfort a person experiences when confronted with new information that contradicts one of their beliefs. \nIt is so widespread that I think it even extends into culinary matters. By this, I mean that a common reason for someone not liking a dish is that they have a preconceived idea of the flavor, only to have it taste significantly different. \nThe ensuing violation of expectation requires that they reject the new option even though it is actually good on its own merits. Take frozen pizza. Although connoisseurs frown upon it, I only think it is because they are comparing it to the restaurant variety. If they would think of it as a different animal, they might understand its greatness. \nAt the same time, some frozen pizza is better than others. In that spirit, Dr. Oetker Virtuoso pizza is an attempt to give the Tombstones and Red Barons a run for the money. Being the No. 1 frozen pizza in Italy should be reason enough to try it. With a great sale price, it\u2019s a closed case! \nTotis snacks \u2014 To save on school lunches, I noticed Totis snack sacks on sale for the first time. While they are economically priced in the first place, a sale makes a good thing better. In addition, with flavors different from Frito Lay, this kind of variety can literally be thought of as the spice of life. \nIn addition to these highlights, you can get access to over 100 spectacular offers at the provided links in the online article and on our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/LubbockSavvyShopper or log on to Facebook and enter \u201cLubbock Savvy Shopper\u201d in the search tool).
