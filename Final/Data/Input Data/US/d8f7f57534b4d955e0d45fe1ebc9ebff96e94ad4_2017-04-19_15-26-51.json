The seas have been emptied, the bedrock and soil stripped of their resources, and the superheated atmosphere churns with terrible storms. Those who can afford to do so live in the limbo of virtual reality, and the billions who suffer in poverty have no work, no clean water, and no security from the chaos.\nThe only hope for those trapped on a dying Earth are the Changed\u2014the seven bioengineered post-humans who work in their separate manufacturing facilities orbiting high above the planet. Raised from birth for their work and fully matured at ten years old, their genius provides the nanomaterials that have begun to cleanse Earth of the pollutants that have wiped out almost the entire ecosphere.\nBut for Olga Voronov, youngest of the Changed, the isolation and endless toil are not the greatest of her challenges. Down on Earth there are those who resent and fear her talents\u2014and would prefer that humanity not be given the second chance that only she could make possible \u2026\nAdd to Goodreads \nBuy Link : Amazon \nExcerpt: CHAPTER SIX: CHANGED \n \n\u2026Paris. December. But this was not the city whose streets Olga loved to prowl on a motorcycle in her early childhood.\nOlga and Arina Rodionovna slowly walked along the central streets. The simulator reproduced the thick snowfall and cold wind with exceptional precision. Their fashionable leather boots squished over the slush as they walked down trash-filled sidewalks and past once-fashionable shops whose windows were covered with steel shields and twined with concertina wire. There were no trees left\u2014they had long since been cut down for firewood. Only one out of every ten street lamps operated since electricity was so costly. Hydrogen powered vehicles hummed down the street. A large column of smoke rose into the sky from a few blocks away. Shots were heard as rioters and the army traded gunfire. A huge line of people stood in front of a government office. Judging by their looks, they had spent many hours in the cold.\n\u201cNowadays you will see a similar picture in all the major cities,\u201d Arina said. \u201cThe situation here is still rather calm. The army still has control of the city center, though they steer clear of the outskirts if they can help it.\u201d\n\u201cAre all those people unemployed?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and they are seeking food rations. Most of them have never had a permanent occupation. And never will.\u201d\nOlga shrugged. It wasn\u2019t her problem.\nThere was too little work left for Earth\u2019s huge population. Hardly ten percent of them were employed. The space industry with its high efficiency had ruthlessly destroyed most enterprises on Earth. The farming industry had also changed drastically over the pat fifty years, with fully automatic facilities needing almost no personnel.\nFinally, there were Olga and other representatives of the Changed from her generation. The symbiosis of the artificial intellect and nanomachines has given them virtually unlimited capabilities. And so the billions of ordinary people had become useless for anything except standing in lines for free rations.\nOlga had never felt sorry about that, taking this state of things as a matter of course. Since her early childhood she understood that you can\u2019t stand in the way of progress or progress will crush you. These people couldn\u2019t compete with her, and so in compliance with the omnipotent laws of evolution, they were doomed to defeat and squalor. The sole thing that worried Olga was that sooner or later she too could be replaced. This option was not unlikely either.\n\u201cWe observe the classical vicious circle,\u201d Arina said. \u201cNo work, no money. No money, no trade. No trade, no work. Nowadays to live on Earth, one must be either very rich or very poor. All others have gone to the orbit.\u201d\nThe sirens howled out their warnings of the commencement of the curfew and the closure of borders between the districts. Olga shuddered as a gust of cold wind hurled wet snow into her face. Even as the rest of the world baked, Europe had frozen with the cessation of Gulf Stream current.\n\u201cWell, Raven, have you decided not to return to Earth when your contract expires?\u201d\nOlga stopped. Her glance took in the dark streets, barred windows, dismal figures.\n\u201cHere? I don\u2019t think so \u2026 But where shall I go?\u201d\nAbout the Author Yuri Hamaganov lives in Moscow. He created the eight-volume GROND series as a present for himself when he was twelve years old. This was the story he had always dreamed of exploring, and when he realized that nobody had written it for him, he set out to do it himself.\nGIVEAWAY: \na Rafflecopter giveaway \nBlog Tour Organized by:\n\nYA Bound Book Tours \nBlog Tour Schedule \u2013 April 10 th \nThe Silver Dagger Scriptorium http://silver-dagger-scriptorium.weebly.com/ Promo Post\nThe Book Adventures of Annelise Lestrange http://www.anneliselestrange.wordpress.com/ Promo Post\nTriquetra Reviews http://www.triquetrareviews.blogspot.com/ Promo Post\n3 Partners in Shopping, Nana, Mommy,&,Sissy, Too! http://3partnersinshopping.blogspot.com Promo Post\nApril 11 th \nA Night\u2019s Dream of Books http://anightsdreamofbooks.blogspot.com/ Promo Post\nWhat Is That Book About www.whatisthatbookabout.com Promo Post\nThe Avid Reader http://the-avidreader.blogspot.com Promo Post\nRead day and night http://readdayandnight.blogspot.com Review\nApril 12 th \nReads & Reels http://www.readsandreels.com Review\nYA Book Divas http://www.yabookdivas.com Promo Post\nLiterary Musings http://literarymusing.weebly.com Promo Post\nTwo Heartbeats http://twoheartbeats.org Promo Post\nWishful Endings http://www.wishfulendings.com/ Promo Post\nApril 13 th \nBooks,Dreams,Life http://staceyschneller06.wordpress.com Promo Post\nLoves Great Reads https://lovesgreatreadsblog.wordpress.com/ Promo Post \nMikayla\u2019s Bookshelf www.mikaylasbookshelf.blogspot.com Promo Post\nbookblogarama http://bookblogarama.com Promo Post\nThe Adventures of SacaKat https://sarahfairbairn.com/ Promo Post\nApril 14 th \nSolaFide Book Club http://solafidepublishing.net/solafide-self-publishing-and-book-blog/ Promo Post\nforthenovellovers https://forthenovellovers.wordpress.com/ Review\nWonderful Monster http://wonderfulmonsterbook.wordpress.com Review\ndeal sharing aunt http://dealsharingaunt.blogspot.com/ Promo Post\nZerina Blossom\u2019s Books http://www.zerinablossom.com/ Promo Post\n\n\n\u2665 Facebook \u2665 Twitter \u2665 Tumblr \u2665 GoodReads \u2665 DON\u2019T FORGET TO FOLLOW OUR BLOG. \n.
