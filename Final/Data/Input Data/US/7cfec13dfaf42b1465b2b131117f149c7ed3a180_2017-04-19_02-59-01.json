In fact, multiple sources confirmed to THR that, even though CNN was close to filing a motion to unseal O\u2019Reilly\u2019s matrimonial records, they are now leaning against this action, despite the fact that some executives are strongly in favor of it. CNN's internal debate: Go after Bill O'Reilly divorce records? https://t.co/vKhAUpKnQo pic.twitter.com/dUDIX4DS8d \n\u2014 Hollywood Reporter (@THR) April 14, 2017 \nWhile CNN has been happy to contact Fox News advertisers as they jump off the O\u2019Reilly ship, but \u201cwading into a sticky divorce\u201d may come a bit too close to media cannibalism than some at the network are comfortable with. Or maybe they fear karma. \nAlthough the records of the 2010 court battle are confidential, some information has become public, including a 2015 Gawker report about trail transcripts detailing testimony from O\u2019Reilly\u2019s teenage daughter saying her dad struggles to control his rage and that she witnessed her dad \u201cchoking her mom\u201d and dragging \u201cher down some stairs\u201d by the neck. \nWhether or not CNN or another network is able to get court records unsealed, it may not matter in the end, since O\u2019Reilly is now accusing his ex-wife of defrauding him into a separation agreement to \u201cfinance an existing extra-marital relationship.\u201d Because of this, a New York judge may be making lots more heretofore private information public. \nBut whatever happens, CNN\u2019s reluctance to hit O\u2019Reilly where it hurts the most could prove that there is indeed at least some honor among thieves, er, media outlets! \nOr, media execs living in glass houses are afraid to throw a stone that big. \nwww.bizpacreview.com/2017/04/15/cnn-blinks-chance-unseal-bill-oreilly-sordid-divorce-records-stopped-473230 \u2018Keep It Going\u2019: \u2018GoFundMe\u2019 Amount for Fallen Green Beret Who Leaves 5 Kids Shows Who Americans Truly Are Top Stories Shock Report BLOWS HOLES In Liberal Myth That Trump\u2019s Travel Cost...
