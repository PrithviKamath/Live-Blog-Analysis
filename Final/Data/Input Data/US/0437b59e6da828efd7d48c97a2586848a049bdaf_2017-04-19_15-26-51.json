Although this was my first time reading anything written by Pamela Clare, it will not be my last.  \n\nThe story line is well written and well paced.  I was captivated by Ellie and Jesse's story right from the very first chapter.  Both characters are incredibly endearing.  Ellie is a strong, intelligent, hard working, kind, compassionate and caring.  She's an amazing single mother to her precocious and adorable twins Daisy and Daniel.  \n\nJesse is a protective, sexy, heroic, and sweet hero with a huge heart.  A slightly damaged alpha who is a caretaker underneath his tough guy exterior.  \n\n\nThis is a story of loss, second chances, and finding love again.  It a sweet and steamy blend with moving and emotional heartfelt moments.  Both heartbreaking and heartwarming, you will need the tissues close by.  The emotions felt very realistic and I was enthralled with their story.  \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed watching their relationship develop.  I thoroughly recommend Falling Hard to anyone who enjoys a slow burn, contemporary romance with insta-lust. I look forward to reading more of Pamela Clare's work in the future.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarely Breathing  \n(Colorado High Country #1) \n\nLexi Jewell left Scarlet Springs twelve years ago, vowing never to return to the eccentric Colorado mountain town where she grew up.
