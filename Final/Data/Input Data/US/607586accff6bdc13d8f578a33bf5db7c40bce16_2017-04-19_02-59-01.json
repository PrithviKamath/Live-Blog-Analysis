Almost certainly your friend has not \u201cbeen hacked\u201d. Instead an annoying person has just created a new Facebook account and copied your friend\u2019s profile picture and name, and is presumably now going through their friend list asking to become friends. What can you do? \nUse the Facebook \u201cReport\u201d function to let your friend know. Open the fake profile page (Just click on the name. Don\u2019t click on Confirm Request!) Click on the\u2018 \u2026\u2019 button (to the right of the Message button), then click Report . Select Report this profile and click Continue Select They're pretending to be me or someone I know and click Continue Select Someone I know and click Continue Select Message your friend Type in your friend\u2019s name. Your friend\u2019s existing Facebook profile should be listed. Click Send. You friend will receive a Facebook message with a link to the offending profile and they can follow it up by reporting it to Facebook. \nIf you\u2019re particularly concerned, at step 6 you can also choose Submit to Facebook for Review. You will then be asked to select your friend\u2019s real Facebook profile and send it off to Facebook.", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQnFiWvB_l9TFdMY4dOJ.IpGqUiRHZANjx5eHpPf5r.wPizewy_5clJv.0R_7zn4ZjXWOVdr5p6cHtM2wmHm0wWUL.1JRLv0.8-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T11:18:32.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "You just received a friend request on Facebook from someone who\u2019s already a friend", "thread": {"title_full": "You just received a friend request on Facebook from someone who\u2019s already a friend", "site_full": "david.gardiner.net.au", "site": "gardiner.net.au", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/DavesDaydreams", "performance_score": 0, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": null, "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "country": "US", "section_title": "David Gardiner - Dave's Daydreams", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQnFiWvB_l9TFdMY4dOJ.IpGqUiRHZANjx5eHpPf5r.wPizewy_5clJv.0R_7zn4ZjXWOVdr5p6cHtM2wmHm0wWUL.1JRLv0.8-", "published": "2017-04-16T11:18:32.000+03:00", "title": "You just received a friend request on Facebook from someone who\u2019s already a friend", "uuid": "607586accff6bdc13d8f578a33bf5db7c40bce16", "main_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ARHmW36gEX4/WPMNU6ISViI/AAAAAAAACAo/ko-nO-Gyvts/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/Facebook-Report_thumb.png?imgmax=800"}, "uuid": "607586accff6bdc13d8f578a33bf5db7c40bce16", "ord_in_thread": 0}]
