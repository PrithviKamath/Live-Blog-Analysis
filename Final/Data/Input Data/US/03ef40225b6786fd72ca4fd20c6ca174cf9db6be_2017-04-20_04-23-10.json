BALANZA\nDue to its success as a rehabilitation program for prisoners, the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) is planning to adopt for implementation in Iwahig Penal Colony in Palawan, its Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) with Tagum Development Corporation (Tadeco). The JVA involves about 5,300 hectares of the Davao Penal Colony (Dapecol) in Sto. Tomas town in Davao del Norte that Tadeco developed into a banana plantation. The 25-year deal is primarily aimed at the rehabilitation of the inmates with Tadeco hiring out Dapecol prisoners as farm hands paid with minimum wage. \u201cThis rehabilitation program has been found to be very successful by BuCor, to the extent that the latter has even requested Tadeco to replicate the JVA program to its penal colony in Iwahig, Palawan,\u201d said Tadeco in a statement. In response to the BuCor request, in a report in BusinessMirror, Alexander N. Valoria, president and CEO of the Antonio O. Floirendo Management and Investment Corp. (Anflocor), said Tadeco has sent two missions to look into the situation in Iwahig. Tadeco is yet to propose its recommendations to start the project, said Valoria as a resolution was filed in the House of Representatives questioning the Tadeco-BuCor JVA. House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez has filed House Resolution 867 to investigate the allegedly \u201cgrossly disadvantageous\u201d 25-year \u201clease contract\u201d signed by BuCor and Tadeco. Reports say that Alvarez\u2019s motive in filing the resolution was his ongoing spat with Rep. Antonio Floirendo, Jr., top honcho of the Tadeco banana empire. READ MORE PANTALEON ALVAREZ In separate statements, Tadeco and Valoria disputed Alvarez\u2019s claim, saying the Tadeco-BuCor deal, a JVA and not a lease contract, is \u201clegal and advantageous to the government.\u201d The JVA was first signed in 1956 and was last reviewed by Congress in 2012. \u201cThe JVA has been reviewed, and found to be advantageous to the government numerous times by the Executive and the Legislative departments in past administrations,\u201d Tadeco said. Tadeco adds that \u201cthe most recent review in the 15th Congress in 2012 once again arrived at the same positive conclusion regarding the JVA and its benefits to the government.\u201d Even the \u201cDepartment of Justice said during the congressional review that the JVA is above board,\u201d Tadeco in its statement further added. For his part, Valoria, in the report in BusinessMirror, said that even former President Benigno S. Aquino III, who was a senator then, \u201csat at the Blue Ribbon Committee reviewing this agreement.\u201d The bottom line of the JVA, according to Valoria, is \u201cto help the government in providing a good correctional and rehabilitation program for convicts.\u201d Explaining the ground level mechanics of the JVA, Valoria said \u201cprisoners of good standing\u201d are chosen by Dapecol to work in the banana plantation. Valoria said BuCor deploys every day in the Tadeco banana farm about 600 prisoners from its pool of 900 prisoner workers, \u201cas part of the rehabilitation of the prisoners\u201d under the JVA. Valoria said the prisoner workers are paid minimum wage by Tadeco. Many of these prisoners who worked in the Tadeco banana plantation were eventually hired by other plantations after serving their prison terms, said Valoria. "}]
