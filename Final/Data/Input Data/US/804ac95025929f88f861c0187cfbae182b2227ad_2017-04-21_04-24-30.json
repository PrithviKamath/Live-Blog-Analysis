We expect government to fund approximately \u20ac100m of this, and have requested this through the recent public sector-wide review of capital requirements,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cIf granted this would bring the overall state contribution to our \u20ac300m programme to \u20ac140m.\u201d \nThe university recently broke into the top 50 of the Times Higher Education Young University Rankings (for universities aged 50 or under). \nIt has over 11,000 students and has been growing the number of first preferences received under the CAO points system in recent years. \nNolan estimates the university will have about 16,000 students by 2025 and the new plan is designed to right-size the campus for that number. \nThe plan calls for spending \u20ac184m on teaching and research facilities, \u20ac78m for student accommodation, \u20ac24m for sports, recreation, arts and culture, and \u20ac21m for land and infrastructure. \nPlanning applications for parts of the plan will be filed in about six months, Nolan said. \nIt\u2019s part of a wider strategic plan which will see the university put a particular focus on postgraduate education, broadening its research output, and attracting more international students, having revamped its undergraduate offering in recent years. \nNolan backed reform of the funding model for university education. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that people understand just how stark things are right now. In 2007, every student in a non-laboratory discipline that was being educated in this institution, and UCD, and Trinity, had \u20ac9,000 spent on them. They were contributing \u20ac800 and the State was contributing \u20ac8,200,\u201d Nolan said. \n\u201cIn 2015, we would have spent about \u20ac7000 per annum on that student\u2019s education. The student was paying \u20ac3,000 of that and the state is paying \u20ac4,000\u2026 so you\u2019re paying a lot more for about \u20ac2,000 per annum less.\u201d \nHe said the decline in funding was hitting disadvantaged students in particular. \nNolan said the fairest system would be to share the costs of undergraduate degrees between the State, employers, and students, who would only begin making contributions when their income reached a certain threshold after the degree. \nThis article was first seen on: http://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/maynooth-university-plots-300m-redevelopment-35626270.html Share this:", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "uuid": "804ac95025929f88f861c0187cfbae182b2227ad", "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "title": "Maynooth University plots \u20ac300m redevelopment", "thread": {"country": "US", "site": "3dpersonnelblog.com", "replies_count": 0, "title_full": "Maynooth University plots \u20ac300m redevelopment", "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 0, "section_title": "", "domain_rank": null, "uuid": "804ac95025929f88f861c0187cfbae182b2227ad", "main_image": "https://h1m9xazj7tlyitm0-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nui-maynooth.jpg", "site_type": "blogs", "title": "Maynooth University plots \u20ac300m redevelopment", "spam_score": 0.0, "site_section": "https://3dpersonnelsite.wordpress.com/feed/", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNvcN7YOvQUPsVOpWBrf7RLxGVzBQOOZtf6iZfc0piBVjdQGRks6v.UafAZyPQe05pFsrUHfGpRMjz3zVK9Rv3ud2HXi1jMo4-", "participants_count": 1, "site_full": "3dpersonnelblog.com", "social": {"linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "published": "2017-04-18T11:26:03.000+03:00"}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T11:26:03.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNvcN7YOvQUPsVOpWBrf7RLxGVzBQOOZtf6iZfc0piBVjdQGRks6v.UafAZyPQe05pFsrUHfGpRMjz3zVK9Rv3ud2HXi1jMo4-", "highlightText": "", "published": "2017-04-18T11:26:03.000+03:00", "author": "3dpersonnelblog"}]
