I read reviews and upgraded to ocean front, which was beautiful. The sliding glass door was extremely difficult to open because of sand in track I guess. We were there on St. Patricks day, definitely lots of partying in the hotel, and on the beach right in front of our room. We were on second floor and heard partying, load music and yelling till the wee hours of morning. One night there was a crying baby in the room next door. Not anyways \"fault\" but the walls were very thing so we felt like we were in the same room. Party on the other side. The pool and hot tub we didn't use but looked very nice and protected from the wind off the beach. Hotel staff Super friendly and accommodating, we didn't complain about noise because I kinda felt like that was just the vibe of the hotel location.", "external_links": [], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "c3e75766cde3a1a368f931cd97cae7bc9c3579f6", "highlightText": "", "rating": 3.0}]
