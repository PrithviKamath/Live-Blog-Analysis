Stephens was wanted for the random killing of a 74-year-old retired man on Sunday. | Photo: ABC-TV \nApril 18, 2017 12:28 PM \nCLEVELAND (AP) - Pennsylvania State Police say the suspect in the random killing of a Cleveland retiree posted on Facebook has shot and killed himself after a brief pursuit.   \nState police say Steve Stephens was spotted Tuesday morning by state police in Erie County, in the state's northwest corner. Authorities say police tried to pull Stephens over and, after a brief pursuit, he shot and killed himself. \nStephens was wanted on an aggravated murder charge in the shooting death of a 74-year-old retired man in Cleveland on Sunday. \nHe posted video of that shooting on Facebook. \n___ \n10 a.m. \nThe Cleveland police chief said Tuesday they had received more than 400 tips from as far away as Texas. \n___ \n7:15 a.m. \nA gun range owner says Steve Stephens had shot at his facility, and video shows he was warned for breaking rules by practicing \"rapid fire.\" \nOwner Blake Frederick says suspect Stephens visited Sherwin Shooting Sports within the past year. Frederick tells Cleveland.com he recalls Stephens as nice and jovial, not negative. \nWEWS-TV reports that a video Stephens posted to Facebook last year showed him rapidly firing at targets at the range in Willoughby and being warned to stop by an employee. \nPolice say the 37-year-old Stephens had a permit to carry a concealed weapon. \nThe multistate manhunt for him stretched into a third day Tuesday. He's wanted on an aggravated murder charge in the Sunday shooting death of a 74-year-old retiree. \n___ \n1 a.m. \nOn Monday evening, Facebook announced that it was launching a review for reporting harmful content following the killing. The company says it disabled Stephen's account within 23 minutes of receiving the first report about the video of the fatal shooting and two hours after receiving any report. Facebook says, \"we know we need to do better.\" WDIO Updated: April 18, 2017 12:28 PM   11:07 AM Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
