Its replacement \u2013 a selection of Front Row highlights \u2013 is not cutting it for the show\u2019s many fans, who enjoy Saturday Review \u2019s round-table-many-voices format, the contributors\u2019 insights and the exemplary presentation skills of Tom Sutcliffe. It does seem sad. Since Tony Hall took over at the head of the BBC, there has been a Corporation shunt away from a journalistic approach to culture towards a practitioner justification of it. Right from the start, Hall said he wanted to \u201cshowcase more of the incredible talent that this country has to offer\u201d \u2013 which is great, except showcasing is all we get. The Review Show is no more. Night Waves went years ago. The Culture Show was decommissioned. And now, bye bye Saturday Review .\nInstead, the BBC offers us programmes where we witness art (beautifully shot performances or festivals; easy-watching shows on painting or pop), or we witness artists talking to other artists. Such shows are entertaining but they are not analytical. Whether it\u2019s Grayson Perry chatting to Naomi Alderman on Radio 4 (great), Michael Palin meeting Jan Morris (not bad) or When Corden Met Barlow (hmm), it\u2019s all celebration and celebrity. No critique. No debate. No argument. Ah, well. The arts have always been subject to whimsical trends within the BBC. Perhaps this is just the one we are in at the moment.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hashi Mohamed, presenter of Adventures in Social Mobility. Photograph: Shaista Chishty\nWe are also, apparently, in a moment of meritocracy, and last week Radio 4 offered us two programmes on the subject. Toby Young\u2019s The Rise and Fall of the Meritocracy , which I\u2019ll come to, and Hashi Mohamed\u2019s Adventures in Social Mobility . Mohamed came to the UK from Somalia when he was nine. He grew up in a three-bedroomed house that had 18 people in it, scored fairly average GCSEs, but then turned himself around in his early 20s to become a beautifully spoken, successful barrister. His story is inspiring but, as he admitted, it\u2019s also atypical. \u201cDoes my story say something about upward mobility,\u201d he wondered, \u201cor the barriers to it?\u201d\nThis programme offered insight into the difficulties that ordinary people must overcome in order to succeed. It\u2019s not just the grades \u2013 the grades are achievable \u2013 it\u2019s what one contributor called a \u201ccultural connectedness\u201d. If you join a law chambers, you may well stay there for years (I didn\u2019t know this), so when you\u2019re being considered for pupillage, your interviewer is thinking: \u201cDo I want this person as my colleague for the rest of my professional life?\u201d No wonder they stick with what or who they know.\nMohamed encouraged young people from outsider backgrounds to tell their stories to get on. But, said one, revealing too much of myself would make me feel vulnerable. (You note that the elite don\u2019t have to do this.) And what if your story is less striking than Mohamed\u2019s? Would anyone care? Should the ordinary person change to fit in, or the professions change to fit the ordinary person?\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Toby Young. Photograph: BBC\nMohamed\u2019s programme packed a lot in. Toby Young\u2019s didn\u2019t get quite so much, but it tried. He took the premise of meritocracy (a term coined by his dad, Michael , who was a Labour peer) and told us it did the opposite of what we think it does. Instead of allowing clever working-class people to progress, it keeps the elite up there. Young believes that if you are born to privilege then not only does your environment push you towards success but, also, your brains do. Your elite genes mean you are cleverer.\nThis is not an argument that everyone agrees with, and many of his contributors, including Oliver James and Michael Sandel , took him to task. Perhaps it was my addled liberal brain, but I couldn\u2019t quite work out where Young stood within his analysis. He predicted that \u201cthe disenfranchised masses\u201d would boil over and \u201cthe liberal world order will be swept away\u201d. (Hence Brexit and Trump.) But, other than \u201creadjustment\u201d, he didn\u2019t offer many alternative ideas.\nTopics Radio The Observer Radio 4 BBC Toby Young reviews Reuse this content", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nvb.iEnU1.6mdBzJ.0eU5XIwDMQ_LflCoaSkmaviUetUmKXpruxmm18ZmhuYRtJ.kRrbozFjXj73WzMz9_UrYqeyJOjJvhVjbrjubPqtLKu1usyKbMcxzcU.xvF1eFcgv", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T09:25:08.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "The week in radio: Saturday Review; Adventures in Social Mobility; The Rise and Fall of the Meritocracy | Television & radio | The Guardian", "thread": {"title_full": "The week in radio: Saturday Review; Adventures in Social Mobility; The Rise and Fall of the Meritocracy | Television & radio | The Guardian", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc/rss", "performance_score": 0, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 8, "shares": 8, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": 170, "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "country": "US", "section_title": "BBC | The Guardian", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nvb.iEnU1.6mdBzJ.0eU5XIwDMQ_LflCoaSkmaviUetUmKXpruxmm18ZmhuYRtJ.kRrbozFjXj73WzMz9_UrYqeyJOjJvhVjbrjubPqtLKu1usyKbMcxzcU.xvF1eFcgv", "published": "2017-04-16T09:25:08.000+03:00", "title": "The week in radio: Saturday Review; Adventures in Social Mobility; The Rise and Fall of the Meritocracy | Television & radio | The Guardian", "uuid": "1fafee373f227c2c2f5e02f3a3a421d64f081697", "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0c87b5dc1057bb45369c873b7f9e3d6cff25889/323_550_3157_1894/master/3157.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=ec8db77a55453189a83079c4baa94705"}, "uuid": "1fafee373f227c2c2f5e02f3a3a421d64f081697", "ord_in_thread": 0}]
