We\u2019re on a walk through his new home of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, and he\u2019s bringing me to one of his favorite spots, where the ocean meets a cemetery filled with bright-white headstones. Lopez chose the neighborhood so he could be inspired by the candy-colored colonial architecture that lines the hilly, cobblestone-paved streets. He\u2019s here to run a business, to reconnect with family and old friends, but he also needs to sketch.\nThe admission shouldn\u2019t be shocking to anyone who\u2019s queued up for his Mofongo NY pop-up since its debut at the massive Brooklyn outdoor food market Smorgasburg in 2014. From the bright green pil\u00f3n that illustrates its logo to the similarly saturated photos that populate its Instagram feed , it\u2019s clear that whoever\u2019s behind the brand has a deliberate artistic vision\u2014one that aims to bring Puerto Rican cuisine to the kind of audience who\u2019s seduced by a tight concept. Lopez, in running his business, has taken on the role of de facto cultural ambassador for Puerto Rico. He\u2019s taken Mofongo NY to Japan, and he organizes a yearly New York City party with a group of other island-based creatives called Cosa Nuestra that he hopes to take global.\nThe concept worked in Brooklyn of course, where Lopez had moved in 2011 from western Puerto Rico, to work in marketing and design until growing restless and coming up with the idea of serving a twist on his grandmother\u2019s mofongo \u2014the traditional Puerto Rican dish of fried and mashed plantains topped with a protein, usually pork\u2014to those strolling by.\nThis year, though, he\u2019s brought his new-school take on mofongo back to his home island to sell\u2014oddly enough\u2014at a new open-air market much like Smorgasburg. The skills he honed in Brooklyn dealing with long lines and fast turn-arounds have come in handy, but here he doesn\u2019t have to set up shop anew each weekend; the kiosks are stand-alone structures, making for a much more streamlined experience. A fresh concept for San Juan, it\u2019s called Lote 23 and vendors are selling everything from cold brew tonics to bao buns to pizzas. Lopez\u2019s food is the most traditional on the roster.\nServing mofongo to New Yorkers and tourists is one thing; for the most part, they didn\u2019t grow up with the dish. Here in Puerto Rico, there\u2019s no such luxury of ignorance. So he\u2019s sweating the details and choosing to do his own take. His ropa vieja, braised for 12 hours, is gently added to the bowl with a pair of tweezers; pork loin is cooked sous vide. While it\u2019s still traditional, this preparation shows off what he\u2019s learned from years of eating in New York: to justify your existence, you have to offer a new twist.\nThe idea, Lopez says, is to introduce Puerto Ricans not just to mofongo, but to Mofongo NY, the brand, which he would like to expand into restaurants of various levels\u2014from the street food at the base to a fine-dining take on the island\u2019s cuisine\u2014but that\u2019s just what he\u2019s thinking today. He \u201ccould never have a straight answer\u201d for what he wants. \u201cIt\u2019s constantly changing,\u201d he tells me.\n\u201cI feel like I have more opportunity in Puerto Rico than I have in New York,\u201d he adds. Though he\u2019s only guaranteed to pop up at Lote 23 for two months and has one season left on his Smorgasburg contract, he sees himself staying on the island, near family who still live where he grew up, on the west side of the island in Aguada. He\u2019s just become an uncle for the first time.\nLote 23 was founded by another young Puerto Rican who spent years in New York City working in marketing: Cristina Sumaza. While there, she had a part in founding the nonprofit ConPRmetidos , which was dedicated with connecting the diaspora to the island, but when she moved back she joined her family\u2019s real estate development business. Sumaza and Lopez are part of a generation that is seeking to revive the island\u2019s cultural life as a means of empowering it economically, in spite of, or in direct opposition of the ongoing debt crisis.\n\u201cWhen you compare Puerto Rico to the U.S., basically everywhere is a low-income community,\u201d Sumaza says. \u201cComing from New York, I would go to tons of restaurants and markets. Here I was living in Santurce, where there are all these amazing chefs and artists,\u201d and she wanted to create a space to support and highlight local talent. \u201cThey all have their own followers and fans,\u201d she says, which helps create traffic for everyone. \u201cThe collective impact that they can all have is what makes this really special.\u201d\nLote 23 has provided a launch pad for that potential impact, providing space mainly for concepts that are brand-new to the area. Established chefs, such as Xavier Pacheco, whose restaurant La Jaquita Baya is a few miles away in the Miramar area, here serves tacos he\u2019s calling \u201cbigotes.\u201d Paxx Caraballo Moll, a chef who used to cook at El Departamento de La Comida and Jos\u00e9 Enrique, had trouble getting a food truck off the ground on the island, but regularly sells out at El Baoricua\u2019s Lote kiosk.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t go to Santurce five years ago,\u201d Lopez tells me, but that\u2019s changed. The Santurce Es Ley arts festival has brought tourists in who take pictures of the street-art-covered block Calle Cerra, and the nearby Libros AC bookstore offers music programming and readings. During the lunch hours, Lote 23 is populated mostly by office workers in suits from the nearby banks.\nThere are still worries that Lote 23 will be a gentrifying force; many locals initially took to the Facebook page find the food and concept to be excellent, but the prices high. One bowl of mofongo here goes for $10, and a Medalla (the ubiquitous local beer) costs $3. Lopez points out that you can get one in La Placita de Santurce , a popular hangout, for as low as $1, and in the more downtrodden Tras Talleres for even $.50. A focus on engaging community programming could at least help change the conversation, Lopez believes, and they are offering free weekly movie nights and yoga classes. Something seems to be working: As Lote has been open longer, some of the sticker shock has dissipated and five-star reviews have rolled in. \u201cExcellent ambiance,\u201d raves Luis A. Febles in Spanish on the page. \u201cI went with my family and had a great time. We\u2019ll definitely return!\u201d\nAt the kiosk, Lopez is all business while he explains the menu to curious customers and roosters casually strut in from the parking lot. He and an employee are both decked out in logo-embroidered guayaberas and aprons made especially for this pop-up: \u201cBorn in Puerto Rico. Back in Puerto Rico.\u201d The branding, as usual, is flawless.\n\u201cI learned how to fail over there and how to develop a product that was true to what I was doing, and it takes time to develop that\u2014to the point now where I feel confident,\u201d Lopez says of his time in New York City. But here, the mission has taken on new meaning. \u201cWe know how to brand things, we know how to make them look appealing, but can we make them taste good? Are we really being true to what our ancestors did?\u201d Back home now, that has been revealed: This season will be Mofongo NY\u2019s last in Smorgasburg, and the lease at Lote 23 was extended.\n\u00a9 2017 SAVEUR\nAll rights reserved."}]
