What niche should you choose and how to find whether it\u2019s profitable or not? \nChoosing a profitable, low competition niche is quite difficult even for many established bloggers . And for newbies, they may have virtually no idea how to find one. \nBut as Amazon has a vast variety of products, it\u2019s actually pretty simple. \nHere are a few points you should consider before choosing a niche: \nFirst- Make sure you have an interest in the niche you want to promote on your blog. \nWhen I started my first blog in Feb. 2015, I didn\u2019t do any research, but I was fond of gaming and computer parts. So, I just started my website on that. I had no idea about writing good articles and doing keyword research , and I made a lot of deadly mistakes that caused me to delete my whole blog multiple times. \nBut as my interest kept me writing articles on the niche, I stayed positive. If I had started writing on fashion design, simply because it\u2019s a profitable niche, surely I would have failed miserably because of my lack of knowledge and interest. \nBut what if you have knowledge in a field that doesn\u2019t have a product sold on Amazon? \nWell, that\u2019s a problem. \nWhen I made my first blog successful , I started another Amazon-based website that was related to furniture. I don\u2019t know anything about this niche, but money is my motivation here. \nWhen you find a profitable niche, then you will automatically start writing on products you don\u2019t even like. But because you\u2019ve learned that you like blogging, you can learn how to overlook the lack of interest in the niche. \nThis will make you more knowledgeable in that field as well as help you earn more money. \nBut this is not recommended for newbies. The trick here is discipline. It\u2019s better to give this one a shot after you\u2019ve already built up a successful blog around a niche you like, otherwise, as pointed out above, you will fail miserably. \nSome good niches you can try right now are: Automotive parts Home decoration Any sports niche like water sports, skating, or winter sports \nNote that every niche will have some competition, but these niches are not so saturated at the moment. \nPro tip: Always make notes of a niche you are going to start before posting your first article. How To Rank Faster In These Niches \nRanking is getting tougher as bloggers are emerging in every field every day. Know that it can take several months when you do SEO with white hat techniques (i.e. \u201clegal\u201d SEO practices), but Google will eventually trust your site more than other sites . So keep your site clean and make great content. \n1. Produce content from reviews, not from product descriptions . \nTo rank faster, you need to produce quality content. \nTo do that, you can\u2019t just re-write the description from Amazon\u2019s product page. \nInstead, you should read the customer reviews and use them to elaborate on your points. \nIf you do this, people will trust you more as you are listing the pros as well as the cons. But be sure you always choose products with many reviews (especially those with 4-star ratings and above). \n2. Update Regularly . \nThe second step to ranking faster is to continuously update. \nYou need to update every article at least once a month. Read: Why you must edit old posts . \nAnd yes, it\u2019s a headache, but it really works. \nA lot of my competitors are confused why I am ranking above them, even though I don\u2019t have too many dofollow links and I have a much lower PA and DA . \nThey don\u2019t realize that there are several other factors that increase Google ranking. \nFor instance, if you get backlinks from relevant niche sites, then that counts as a ranking factor in the eyes of Google much better than getting backlinks from sites in a completely different niche. Even if your link is nofollow , it will still help you in ranking faster because Google doesn\u2019t ignore it completely. \nUpdating your content regularly and fetching it with Google search console will make the Google bots crawl your post again and again. When you change or add some content, Google gives it priority over those that aren\u2019t updated regularly. \nNote: When you update your content, also make sure that you change the date/time of update. \n3. Use links with the keyword . \nThe third tip is to use the exact keyword in your URL which you are going to target. \nI have seen that the URLs which have the exact keyword without alteration tend to rank higher than the others. And this is one of the strategies I use to rank my sites above my competitors. \nYes, some of my links may be long, but they contain the exact keyword, and this method helps me consistently rank higher. But at the same time, make sure that if you are going to update the article with some new products, you should not include the specific name of any product in your URL. \nMust read: How to edit permalink of already published blog post How To Increase The Conversion Rate \nIf you think that changing colors of \u2018Buy\u2019 links or optimizing images doesn\u2019t affect the conversion rate, then think about every successful online business out there. \nWhy are colors like red and blue the most widely used colors in \u2018Buy\u2019 buttons? \nWhy don\u2019t people use pink or gray? \nWhen I first used black for my buttons, I got half the amount of clicks as I did with blue and red. \nNot only that, even the size of these buttons matter. The button size should not be too small so that a reader can\u2019t see and not too large to fill up the whole width of your page. Instead, use a size somewhere between 200-400 pixels. \nNow, experiment by changing the colors around. Blue and red tend to have the most dramatic effects on CTR. \n-Include More Links- \n\u2018Buy\u2019 buttons should not be the only place with links. \nYou must use the affiliate links in images and text as well. \nRemember that when you use a product name in a paragraph, put a link in that particular product name which should redirect them through your Amazon affiliate link. \nBe sure you are using a catchy color for that text so that it attracts the visitor. \nYou just need to get a click because that\u2019s how you get the user to drop a cookie on Amazon. \nAmazon uses a 24-hour cookie to track your ID and gives you commission even if it\u2019s not the same product as you promoted. 20% of the products I get a commission from are different than the products I promote. \n-Use A Link Localizer- \n80% of affiliates don\u2019t use a link localizer, which is stunning, because you are losing a lot of money if you are not using one. \nHere\u2019s how this works\u2026 \nI am Indian, and I target four countries: USA UK India \n80% of my affiliate income is from the USA, which is pretty common for many affiliate marketers. But countries like the UK and Canada give good conversions as well. \nThe point is that when a user from the US clicks on my link, it takes them to the US Amazon store. When a user from Canada clicks on a link, it takes them to the Canada Amazon store. \nNote: I use Payoneer for getting payments from the UK and Canada, and I am still figuring out whether I should get a check or direct transfer! LOL! But I can use that money for hiring a native English writer or do a gift card giveaway for Canadian people. \nYou\u2019re probably thinking that I\u2019m using the EasyAzon plugin or something like that for link localizing. But no, I use a website called Affiliate Geo Target . You can also use popular tool call Geni.us that is used by ShoutMeLoud & other blogs. \nFor using Affiliate Geo target, you have to fill in the product ASIN\u2019s from the product page and the tracking IDs from each of the country\u2019s Amazon affiliate dashboards. Doing that, whenever a visitor clicks the link, they will be redirected to their country\u2019s Amazon store. \nThis site will replace every 100 th affiliate ID with their own ID, but it\u2019s still a good deal because you were already losing a lot of money by not using it. \nBut be sure the product you are promoting is also available on every Amazon store. If not, you should only fill in the Amazon.com\u2019s product ASIN and use the Fallback Search Terms. Promotion Is Important \nPosting and praying that traffic will come doesn\u2019t work anymore. It\u2019s like throwing a party at the middle of jungle where no one known how to reach. You have to quality time promoting the content. \nFrom the very first time you post your first article, you should create a separate profile for your brand or niche blog on each social media platform like Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Reddit, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and others. These are mega authority websites, and getting a nofollow link from them will surely help. Whenever you add a new content, you should post them on your social media. \nHere are few not to miss promotion strategy that works to increase affiliate sales:", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRpIxM1cS1bqtOXSLkWlUnPGEzKJ4tqhWxCuMUlP6LQVUaLN57W000YhjMWRFVJeWxA1PL9ymkXenWj0L5c0e3OZljZaebp0zs-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T09:21:55.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "The Ultimate Beginner\u2019s Guide To Mastering Amazon Affiliate Marketing", "thread": {"title_full": "The Ultimate Beginner\u2019s Guide To Mastering Amazon Affiliate Marketing", "site_full": "www.shoutmeloud.com", "site": "shoutmeloud.com", "site_section": "https://www.shoutmeloud.com", "performance_score": 0, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 12}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "facebook": {"likes": 34, "shares": 34, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": 2459, "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "country": "US", "section_title": "ShoutMeLoud", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRpIxM1cS1bqtOXSLkWlUnPGEzKJ4tqhWxCuMUlP6LQVUaLN57W000YhjMWRFVJeWxA1PL9ymkXenWj0L5c0e3OZljZaebp0zs-", "published": "2017-04-16T09:21:55.000+03:00", "title": "The Ultimate Beginner\u2019s Guide To Mastering Amazon Affiliate Marketing", "uuid": "2d1296c97bd7804455c68901047dd5617dc2c2cd", "main_image": null}, "uuid": "2d1296c97bd7804455c68901047dd5617dc2c2cd", "ord_in_thread": 0}]
