Despite all the\u2026 stuff . This was achieved, will wonders never cease, by a couple of programmes about, essentially, driving.\nFew people other than the most crashing snobs can dislike Peter Kay. His northern humour may not be to absolutely every single taste, but you\u2019d have to be called something like Peregrine Spunktrumpet to actively eject yourself from his presence. His second series of Car Share kicked off with the usual series of conversations with co-worker Kayleigh, except that now she\u2019s having to commute, these perforce took place on mobile phone. It\u2019s everything low-level infuriating about modern life \u2013 traffic jams, lost phone signals, the actionable mediocrity of Forever FM , the fact that two people can\u2019t manage a simple commute without phoning each other eight times despite having nothing to say. Somehow, in Kay\u2019s hands \u2013 the set condensed into, essentially, his car and sweeping blurs of a Tesco-liveried Manchester \u2013 we learn to forgive, even like, modern life. The staff nights out, the low-level road rage ( you\u2019re the dickhead, you\u2026 dickhead\u201d), the marketing that treats us as infants, even, ulp, S Club 7. A splendid Sian Gibson, as Kayleigh, is obviously so right for Mr Kay, but let\u2019s hope this all remains unrequited for the moment, at least for this too-short four-parter. True, it\u2019s so warm-hearted it can sometimes feel like like having a bath with your socks on, but just when you think you know where it\u2019s going along, will come a savage flash of witty, angry, sublime self-perception.\nWhat a surprise was The Knowledge , a sadly one-off foray allowing cameras into the exam centre for London\u2019s black-cab drivers. This could have been bordering on turbid: instead, focusing on the divergent candidates\u2019 very sweats as they gulped their way through the final \u201cappearance\u201d, it was rendered mesmerising.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Who\u2019d have thought we would invest so much?\u2019: The Knowledge. Photograph: Channel 4 Television\nFour years\u2019 average study , a 70% dropout rate, 25,000 streets and 100,000 landmarks to memorise, the hideous Uber snarling at their heels, yet still, who\u2019d have thought that we could invest so much in willing people to remember you can\u2019t set down on the right at St Mary Axe, and how to get from the Royal British Society of Sculptors to the Royal Institute of British Architects. We learned about plasticity of brain: we learned that no one\u2019s too old to grow clever, despite having been constantly told they\u2019re thick.\nThe eventual exams \u2013 there was a nicely old-fashioned air about these, with most candidates dressed in ties, and it was all \u201cnice to see you again\u2026 I\u2019m still Mr Whitehead, you\u2019re still Mr Tilfrey,\u201d \u2013 had you rooting for everyone, after four winters on scooters with their daughters\u2019 hot-water bottles up their jerseys. And there were tears, from hard-bitten men and women, on getting that green-gold badge. \u201cTen foot tall. Feel ten foot tall.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t stop smiling for a month.\u201d It was, honestly, every bit as exciting as that last University Challenge . As the programme said, keep an eye out for Dave, for Paul, for Kosovan Saimir, next time you\u2019re in the capital, and I will too. My pal the jazz pianist Ian passed the test a few years ago, and similarly speaks of a new lease of life: he\u2019s since persuaded TfL to adorn his cab with \u201cRide with Pride\u201d rainbow livery, so watch out for that and \u2013 shameless plug alert \u2013 his song Over the Westway , a real cabbie\u2019s fresh take on the unloved flyover.\nWhat, quite, to make of how this nice Britain all compares to the London of 1971 as depicted in Guerrilla , an Idris Elba production notably written by John Ridley, the man responsible for the 12 Years a Slave script? The Spectator has already labelled it \u201cSelf-flagellatory pornography designed for white liberal pillocks\u201d , and that was just the headline \u2013 compared to the review itself, it was mealy-mouthed pantywaisting.\nI\u2019m far less inclined to be so censorious, but then I\u2019m far less generally inclined to the taking of recreational offence. True, some of it bordered, politically, on the cartoonish. White people, from the torn-faced lip-purser on the bus to the absurd racism of the Met police, verging on the Not the Nine\u2019o\u2019Clock News \u201cpossession of curly black hair and thick lips\u201d sketch, do not come out of this well. Ever. Unless they\u2019re Irish. Or Marxist-Leninist. And\u2026 um, but did we truly have quite so many black activists being murdered openly on the streets of London, even in 1971? I think we might have read about that.\nFor all that, it\u2019s an honestly valuable, if wholly imagined, testament to the mood of the times, with some viscerally shocking scenes and an utterly credible mood of menace. Rory Kinnear , with his tenderly rightwing face, and Daniel Mays excel as the toxic Rhodesian-tinted \u201cblack power desk\u201d of the Met, as does Babou Ceesay as the rebel without a clue. Babou\u2019s nice liberal teacher Marcus aids the escape of a black \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d \u2013 actually jailed for stabbing someone in an off-licence raid \u2013 and this is meant to be (I think) a tale of how well-meant activism can, when provoked by cold concrete establishment prejudice, lead to escalating madnesses. But Marcus and his accomplice (the oddly miscast Freida Pinto) have nothing to exactly rail against, other than nebulous dissatisfaction with their lot.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Honestly valuable\u2019: Idris Elba in Guerrilla. Photograph: Sky UK Limited\nI can\u2019t imagine that 1971 was anything like a dander through Paradise Garden for any black person in London. Sometimes, though, this feels like being poked too repeatedly, pointlessly, in the ribs with a reversed sjambok.\nIt\u2019s neck and neck now between Line of Duty and Broadchurch , which has suddenly come up on the rails. David Tennant finally showed his fangs \u2013 his \u201ccut off your tiny little cocks\u201d speech, despite being a teensy bit tautologous and delivered to nothing more menacing than a bunch of no-mark slouchers, had elements of his Shakespearian grandeur. Jed Mercurio\u2019s Line of Duty shocked and brilliantly appalled again. Sweaty sofas again early next week. Finally, destination TV returns. It had, after all, been on nothing more than a destination holiday.\nTopics Peter Kay Observer TV reviews Idris Elba Rory Kinnear Broadchurch Line of Duty Documentary reviews Share Reuse this content", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nvb.iEnU1.6mdBzJ.0eU5XIwDMQ_LflCoX9dokF8tlU5cc5ng7atmDBpn6CHRrKzjGZBIsA4xCsWyDpkfd_xrym4.6hFG1kGrrQX6sonLWgMhzbJv0N0NsQSofiSUvbBMqtpRX9maT2P.M_SZq8YRyu.QHox1NX4E", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T10:14:43.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "The week in TV: Peter Kay\u2019s Car Share; The Knowledge; Guerrilla; Broadchurch; Line of Duty | Television & radio", "thread": {"title_full": "The week in TV: Peter Kay\u2019s Car Share; The Knowledge; Guerrilla; Broadchurch; Line of Duty | Television & radio | The Guardian", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/theguardian/culture/rss", "performance_score": 0, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 26, "shares": 26, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": 170, "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "country": "US", "section_title": "Culture | The Guardian", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nvb.iEnU1.6mdBzJ.0eU5XIwDMQ_LflCoX9dokF8tlU5cc5ng7atmDBpn6CHRrKzjGZBIsA4xCsWyDpkfd_xrym4.6hFG1kGrrQX6sonLWgMhzbJv0N0NsQSofiSUvbBMqtpRX9maT2P.M_SZq8YRyu.QHox1NX4E", "published": "2017-04-16T10:14:43.000+03:00", "title": "The week in TV: Peter Kay\u2019s Car Share; The Knowledge; Guerrilla; Broadchurch; Line of Duty | Television & radio", "uuid": "3967efe2ab6bf0509b396494e8e5c7103a9631d1", "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce5db986580c3c26867fc433eee033261e20495e/0_99_3537_2122/master/3537.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=cb42818b84cdb023366895f524d671ae"}, "uuid": "3967efe2ab6bf0509b396494e8e5c7103a9631d1", "ord_in_thread": 0}]
