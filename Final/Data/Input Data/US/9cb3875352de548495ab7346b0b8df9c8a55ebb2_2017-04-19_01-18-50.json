Submitted by nobodysbabynow on Sat, 04/15/2017 - 10:29pm \nI'm trying to be really careful, which means throwing back anyone with any red flag, but I really liked this guy I've been talking to. He is just so sweet, good looking, good natured, from Jamaica, which means trips to fun places. He's a nurse practitioner and a great musician- played with Ziggy Marley, which I thought would be a lie, but I checked it out, and it all checks out. He does have a college age daughter (yikes) which is good enough reason not to meet him, but I thought I'd see what happened. \nBut I thought he was my age. I've always been with older men, and I wanted someone my own age this time. His profile says he's 40. Well, looking him up online, he certainly is an NP, he does work at a hospital nearby, he has great reviews- but he's 50. WHY? He hasn't lied to my face, I haven't asked his age, but the profile it makes me feel like he could either be just looking for hookups and not really be expecting to commit to someone long term and need to ever face the music, or he's someone who's all around dishonest. \nMy first SO, one who originally told me he was 42 was actually 52. He also then told me that he wanted to marry me, and strung me along for 7 years. He never intended to do so. He was an all around dishonest person. But I've told \"white lies\" as well, and I don't consider myself a liar in general. Bummer. I really like this guy. I just ordered two dresses, two tops and a skirt for dates with him. I'm pretty sure those will be used for dates with someone I have yet to meet, or maybe I should just cancel the order. What do you all think? \u00bb Submitted by notsobad on Sat, 04/15/2017 - 11:56pm. \nMy BFF met her last BF on POF. \nHe was wonderful, said and did all the right things. He told a couple of white lies. His age was one. \nAs they dated, he told more lies but in every other way he was perfect and he just seemed to really get her. \nHe turned out to be a complete narcissist. His lies seemed small and unimportant and he was love bombing (look it up) her, so she was willing to look past them. \nI'm not saying this guy is the same but I wouldn't trust him if he can even be honest about his age. \nHe turned his lying about his age on her. He said he was embarrassed to say that he was over 50 and single, that he felt like a total failure at relationships. Her bringing it up just reminded him of what a loser he was. She spent the rest of the night trying to make it up to him, trying to make him realize that she loved him not matter his or past relationship failures. \u00bb Submitted by nobodysbabynow   9:56am. \nThat's exactly what I'm worried about. \u00bb I don't mean to sound Submitted by sanecatlady   12:09am. \nI don't mean to sound negative Nancy because I have heard of online dating working out. But around here... Most people (guys) use the online dating as hookups. My friend has done it for years with no success. My old roommate used POF for dates/sex. Another lady met a creepy guy who liked to be a baby. \nI'm not sure if the paid sites are better. Those were the only ones my friend used for awhile. \nI've always met guys at work, haha. Or at social settings with mutual friends. \u00bb I am starting to think it's Submitted by nobodysbabynow   9:57am. \nI am starting to think it's better to just get offline and join some real life singles groups. \u00bb I met my SO on POF. It can Submitted by Dad's horrible ...   12:34am. \nI met my SO on POF. It can work but you are right to be on the look out for red flags. I agree that if he'll lie about his age he'll lie about other stuff too. I don't get why anyone who is serious about looking for a long term relationship, would lie about anything! I mean, they're going to be caught out eventually! \nI had a game plan on POF. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. I used to be chatting to six or seven guys at a time. Getting to know them. Looking for signs. If they couldn't put in effort at this stage then they were never going to make the cut. This is a prospective life long partner you are looking for, not a lying, cheating scumbag. His messages should be full of honest detail about him and plenty of questions about you. No questions? No response as he obviously isn't that interested. Look for the clues. They are there. \nGood luck. POF worked for me. Just be careful. \u00bb I'm glad you got lucky and Submitted by nobodysbabynow   9:59am. \nI'm glad you got lucky and found a good one! I had several I was chatting with, and narrowed them down to six- then cut them all out for one reason or another, and all was left was this guy who I really liked. I was shocked to find this lie. \u00bb I look at online dating as a Submitted by BethAnne   1:54am. \nI look at online dating as a way to meet fun and interesting people, then once you have met them you can assess how you want things to proceed. In general when I was doing it I would meet someone I was interested in after only a couple of emails and get to know them in person. That way I could better judge chemistry and better read them in person. If there was no chemistry at least I had met someone interesting for a couple of hours. I don't think I ever met anyone who was an awful date this way and met some nice and interesting people. \nThe only person that lied about his age (I think he might have taken off 10 years) I liked as a person but did start everything of with some lies/omissions and was sort of cheating on his on/off again baby mama. But I was able to figure this out pretty quickly and realized he was not a good match for me. \nI think that someone who lies about their age is either trying to play the game and get more or younger dates than otherwise would look at him or they are insecure. \nIf your guy really interests you I suggest meeting up for a date with him and asking him in person why he lied about his age so you can fully gage his response. \u00bb Yes, I'm thinking that it's Submitted by nobodysbabynow   9:59am. \nYes, I'm thinking that it's because he wants younger women, and that makes me think he's a player. \u00bb I'm 52, 53 next month and I Submitted by HeavenLike   5:24am. \nI'm 52, 53 next month and I am proud of it! I love this age, so it genuinely mystifies me what there is to hide about it. \nGuess it all gets down to motives. It's so easy to verify, just ask for a peek at the driver's license on the first date. \nBut... if someone was going to lie to me about their age in order to get what they want from me, what else might they do in pursuit of that same goal? \nIf you are looking for someone to ultimately be a life partner, you sure don't want it started based on a lie. \u00bb That's the thing- Like I Submitted by nobodysbabynow   10:01am. \nThat's the thing- Like I said, I dated a man before who said he was 42 when he was 52. He wasn't planning to fall in love. So after falling in love, he confessed his real age. I had already known he was lying, due to his looks. Well, that relationship was full of broken promises, so I should know- I already know what to do here. Can't meet him. \u00bb I'm on the same page as Submitted by 2Tired4Drama   5:42am. \nI'm on the same page as BethAnne. My suggestion would be to temper your enthusiasm somewhat and wait to see how things develop. \nWhen you have a guy who seems to be interesting, don't drag it out with lots of back and forth e-mail banter. If the basics about him seem to be what you want, then arrange to meet them in a safe, public place. \nI also agree with Heaven, in that if you have already caught this guy in a lie (about a simple fact he shouldn't be ashamed of - like his age) then he's already got a strike against him. \nIf you are throwing back those with red flags, this guy is already waving one. My guess is he lied about his age because he REALLY wants some woman in her 30's, who thinks he is 40. \nNext he'll tell you his daughter would LOVE for him to meet someone and his ex-wife is happy remarried and they get along fine. \nEdit to add: And that college age daughter may not be his only kid, if he's really 50ish. He could easily have a crop of older kids with drama/problems (including gskids) ... maybe he just mentions his \"college age\" daughter because she is the only one who looks good on \"paper.\" \u00bb Yes, I've thought about the Submitted by nobodysbabynow   10:03am. \nYes, I've thought about the same thing, too- the possibility of other kids. His ex gf is on his facebook. She's white, he's black, and she has mixed little kids. Are they his? He hasn't mentioned any other kids. \u00bb I online dated off and on Submitted by learningallthetime   5:41am. \nI online dated off and on from 2012 when I split with ex till I met my now SO and a lot of my friends online date also. It is a mine field. I think you just need to be aware that many people portray themselves as something else online. Also, different people have different agendas and are not honest about them. I was lucky and only had a few dates with different guys before I met my SO. But I was already fed up of it, and told my friends my date with SO was going to be my last and I would just be a crazy cat lady - nearly 2 years later and SO proposed a week ago on top the Empire State Building and we marry soon. \nWatching my friends, and from my own experience, women seem to have a habit of getting caught up in the texts and emails, possibly phone calls, before even meeting the guy. They enjoy the attention (which I think is the same for men) but women seem to build it up and make emotional ties just based on text, then get hurt. I agree with BethAnne that meeting someone quickly to assess real life chemistry is important. I had several dates where I met after a few weeks of near constant back and forth only to be disappointed. With SO we only exchanged 2 emails back and forth, then a few texts and met 3 days after the first connection. \nI have seen friends actually text and call these guys for months, be convinced it is the love of their life and then nothing. I think small fibs on a profile is one thing, but an explanation is needed. \nOn another note, my ex trawls dating sites looking for vulnerable women, will say whatever they want to hear in the hopes of \"borrowing\" money. He plays the doting father on dating sites, when in fact is not. Dating sites are the ultimate fishing pond for the user. \u00bb Ditto for me! I exchanged Submitted by 2Tired4Drama   5:47am. \nDitto for me! I exchanged about three e-mails with my SO before we BOTH agreed we wanted to go ahead and meet for a drink. \nOnce we met in person, there was an obvious spark and we sat and talked for three hours at that first meeting. I had no red flag feelings about him (nor him me) and the rest is history. \nWe've been together more than 10+ years now. \u00bb Submitted by nobodysbabynow   10:05am. \nUsing women for money . This guy, I think, if he's not serious, would be probably dating more than one at the same time- cheating. \u00bb I think people get serious Submitted by moeilijk   6:55am. \nI think people get serious too fast. It's a date. That's the starting point, not a commitment. (I should probably say I hated dating because I was always looking for a serious relationship.) \nMy MIL has done online dating off and on. She lies about her age. She's 67 and says she's 53. She doesn't want to start a relationship with an old fogie, she wants someone who can join her on her 3 day cycling trips, or who wants to go see live bands once a month. She doesn't want someone with health issues who won't be able to live her lifestyle. \nA boyfriend from long ago (back in the chatline days) told me he lied and added 5 years to his age because no one took him seriously if they thought he was 25. \nMaybe your beau is lying because he's a liar. Maybe he's trying to manage expectations. Bottom line, he's telling you he's available and he's interested in finding out more about you. \nAsk him about why he lied about his age on your date. If nothing else, that will start a conversation! \ufffd \n----", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTxnd8Khz2f9zIFOoeEYeuOnCh1gBmjWFnp4ST66AMNkw--", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T08:58:11.000+03:00", "language": "english", "title": "More dating issues- lying about age....what else will they lie about, or no biggie?", "thread": {"title_full": "More dating issues- lying about age....what else will they lie about, or no biggie?", "site_full": "www.steptalk.org", "site": "steptalk.org", "site_section": "https://www.steptalk.org/node/feed/", "performance_score": 0, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "domain_rank": null, "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "country": "US", "section_title": "Step Talk", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTxnd8Khz2f9zIFOoeEYeuOnCh1gBmjWFnp4ST66AMNkw--", "published": "2017-04-16T08:58:11.000+03:00", "title": "More dating issues- lying about age....what else will they lie about, or no biggie?", "uuid": "9cb3875352de548495ab7346b0b8df9c8a55ebb2", "main_image": ""}, "uuid": "9cb3875352de548495ab7346b0b8df9c8a55ebb2", "ord_in_thread": 0}]
