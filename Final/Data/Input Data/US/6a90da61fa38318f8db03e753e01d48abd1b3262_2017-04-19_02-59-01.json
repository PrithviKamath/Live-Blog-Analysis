That\u2019s how I made the acquaintance of Stick Man. \nBerkeley\u2019s March 4 Trump was organized by a man named Richard Black, who announced that members of the alt-right, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists were banned. Among those who did not get the memo were Moshe Daniel, who goes by the nickname \u201cKilt Man.\u201d Daniel depicts himself on Facebook with a giant serrated knife and a T-shirt featuring the face of the late Chilean fascist dictator Augusto Pinochet, the legend \u201cPHYSICAL REMOVAL,\u201d and another of those silhouettes of people being dropped from helicopters\u2014a Pinochet-favored method for dealing with dissenters. \nThe march turned into a \u201csmall riot,\u201d as gun-rights blogger Bob Owens, one of the most widely read on the web, and a cool and clear-thinking moderate, described it after reviewing the available documentation. \u201cBoth sides came to this incident prepared for a fight,\u201d he wrote, concluding it was impossible to see \u201cwho threw the first punch.\u201d In my mind, however, there were at least two moments where the person who threw the first punch was starkly evident. In both cases it was an individual who wore all black, from boots to baseball cap, and carried a distinctive black shield emblazoned with a \u201cV\u201d for victory, and an American flag. The man in black also wore a gas mask, surely in response to a widely disseminated urban legend that antifas are routinely attacking protesters with pepper spray. In one video he whacks a downed anti-Trump protester with the long wooden stick he carries (with two tiny American flags attached, thus he can call it a flagpole). In another, he can be seen smashing his stick down so hard on an unarmed protester\u2019s head that the stick breaks in half. \nHe\u2019s since become a right-wing folk hero, and, after Berkeley police arrested him on several felony charges, naturally, a right-wing martyr. \n(much more at the link) \nThis is a serious problem. Dedicated, hard core alt-righters who push both Russian derived propaganda and are organizing themselves to conduct violence in a way as to lay the blame on left of center Americans who look to peacefully protest. The first tweets under the hashtag #SyriaHoax came from Russia. Cernovich picked up on it; now it's trending in the U.S. \n*We see you* pic.twitter.com/Ek7z7UYniW \n\u2014 Caroline O. (@RVAwonk) April 6, 2017 Berkeley was not a clash between anti/pro Trump groups. This was a pre-planned assault by a group of violent alt-right Trump supporters. pic.twitter.com/aBhqjE0N5e \n\u2014 Caroline O.
