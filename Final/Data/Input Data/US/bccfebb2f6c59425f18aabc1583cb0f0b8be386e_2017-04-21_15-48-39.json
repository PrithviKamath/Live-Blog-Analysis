Sheriff Joe Arpaio was brought up on contempt charges by the Obama Justice Department for enforcing U.S. immigration law. In light of President Trump\u2019s executive order deputizing local law enforcement to enforce U.S. immigration law, it is positively ludicrous that Arpaio would be now prosecuted for doing so. It sends precisely the wrong message to law enforcement, and could deter local agencies from participating in the President\u2019s deputy program for fear of later prosecution. We urge Attorney General Jeff Sessions to review this case and to take any and all action necessary to end this political prosecution or if necessary for the President to grant him a pardon \u2014 after all, he was only doing his job to protect Maricopa County.\u201d \n    experts. \n ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:24:55.000+03:00"}]
