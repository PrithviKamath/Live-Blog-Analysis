We like probiotics, so we focused closely on the ingredients, side effects, and scientific studies. Then, we analyzed numerous consumer reviews to get their take. Finally, we cull the data to give you the most pertinent facts with which to make your decision. 1MD Complete Probiotics Platinum Readers:   Leptigen. What is 1MD Complete Probiotics Platinum? \nFirst off, Complete Probiotics Platinum 1MD is a probiotic supplement designed to improve digestive health with the introduction of live bacteria into the intestinal tract. The product is vegan, non-dairy, non-GMO, gluten free, preservative free, and soy free.

Their website has substantial information about individual products but relatively little about the people who own the company or their background. They do claim to use only the highest quality ingredients and to manufacture at locations that exceed FDA requirements but read on\u2026 Gut health is a big deal right now in weight-loss. Worth a try? 1MD Complete Probiotics Platinum Ingredients\u2013 \u201cToo Many?\u201d \nOur first concern is the sheer number of bacteria strains included in 1MD Complete Probiotics Platinum. Most probiotics contain a few, but this product has eleven distinct strains. According to our Research Editor, \u201cIt is possible to have too much of a good thing. While it may initially appear impressive that the company has included so many different strains of bacteria, there is little evidence that this much is needed.\u201d \nThis unhappy dieter claimed, \u201cI\u2019d been told that some bacteria could help you lose weight and I figured since 1MD Complete Probiotics Platinum had so many different kinds it would work the best. I only lost one pound the month I took it.\u201d \nA disgruntled customer noted, \u201cIt made me more regular, but it didn\u2019t help me lose weight.\u201d \nOthers were more pleased with the results. \nAn optimistic reviewer explained, \u201cI\u2019ve had digestive issues for years that made it difficult for me to exercise. This has sorted a lot of that, and I was able to work out about three times a week.\u201d Scroll   Side Effects\u2013 \u201cUncomfortable\u201d \nOne of the problems with introducing so many strains of bacteria at once is the increased potential for adverse effects. \nOne shopper complained, \u201cI started taking these and was in the bathroom all the time. It was embarrassing.\u201d \nWhile another worried, \u201cMy stomach hurt so much from being bloated that I couldn\u2019t keep taking it.\u201d \nOthers were less bothered by the side effects. \nThere was a pleased client who mentioned, \u201cI expected it to be sort of like a colon cleanse so I wasn\u2019t shocked at how I felt and it tapered off eventually.\u201d \nAccording to our research, products that rely on an overabundance of ingredients that subsequently have the potential to cause increased instances of side effects don\u2019t always go over well once consumers begin using them. If Complete Probiotics Platinum by 1MD isn\u2019t providing real results for people, it is unlikely they will continue using the product. The Science \u2013 \u201cInteresting\u201d \nAt DietSpotlight we love to examine the scientific data that provided the impetus for the development of a product. In the case of 1MD Complete Probiotics Platinum, there are several ingredients we found interesting. Studies have shown an imbalance of bacteria in the digestive tract can influence one\u2019s weight. The various strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium are the two most typically ingested by humans. The real problem is the diversity of these species, which can also be seen in the list of ingredients. Some have been documented to promote weight management while others appear to do nothing or promote weight gain. The three ingredients in 1MD Complete Probiotics Platinum with the most scientific validity are lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus rhamonosus, and Bifidobacterium lactis. The other ingredients appear to have less of a reason to be included.   1MD Complete Probiotics Platinum Work? \nShould I race out for a bottle of Complete Probiotics Platinum 1MD? If you are having digestive health issues, it is possible that a probiotic would be beneficial. This is entirely dependent upon other health conditions. However, there\u2019s nothing that sets this particular brand apart from other brands. We do like the focus placed on the digestive health. This, in turn, could promote weight-loss. \nIf you are ready to lose weight, we suggest considering a product which was created with ingredients that are backed by scientific research to specifically address weight-loss. In our experience, excess ingredients can be problematic if they aren\u2019t working synergistically with all of the others. \n  we\u2019ve seen this year is our product Leptigen . It is made with a combination of four ingredients, which have each been demonstrated in documented clinical research to help increase fat loss and amplify metabolism. Throughout the course of our research we didn\u2019t turn up any reviews that indicated harmful side effects, but we did discover a lot that showed people saw great results. \nThe makers of Leptigen are so excited about their product they\u2019re offering a Special Trial Offer .
