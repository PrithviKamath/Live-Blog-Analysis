For more, see below: \nWe are happy to announce the third release in our Barrel-Aged Series lineup: \nDoom may be impending but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to fear it. A collision of worlds, the intense hop character of our imperial IPA mingles with the warm vanilla and oak notes imparted from time spent in our favorite bourbon barrels. Like all good things, Doom comes to those who wait. \nWe last released Doom in 2013 as part of our Backstage Series of beers, although it was featured in our taproom as a draft-only option long before that. Its return has been much-anticipated and we can\u2019t wait to share it with you all. \nDoom , an imperial IPA aged in bourbon barrels, is the third release of 2017 in the Barrel-Aged Series, preceded by Frootwood and KBS . There are two remaining Barrel-Aged Series beers to be announced this year, with the returning favorite Backwoods Bastard being the fifth in the lineup. \nABV and IBU information will be available soon. Doom will be available across our distribution network beginning in May through June, in 750mL bottles and 4-packs of 12oz bottles with a suggested retail price of $14.99/4-pack 12oz bottles and $11.99/750mL bottle.
