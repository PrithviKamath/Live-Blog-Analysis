Photo: Courtesy Photo Image 17 of 17 Fratello's opening downtown location in ex-home of O'liva 1 / 17 Back to Gallery Fratello's is adding a new location, downtown in the former home of O'liva, which closed in October. The location is at 115 Plaza de Armas, Suite 107, next to the Spanish Governor's Palace and behind City Hall.\nThe opening is tentatively set for May 1.\nPlans call for the restaurant to be open from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday, serving breakfast and lunch. There will be a coffee bar and a grab-and-go counter in addition to table seating for dining in.\nBreakfast will offer an assortment of pastries, breakfast panini and breakfast pizzas, plus yogurt cups and seasonal fruit. Everything will be made in-house except the yogurt, said manager Marilyn Magaro. Lunch will offer a slightly smaller version of the menu of Fratello's Broadway location , with salads, soups, antipasti and plenty of pasta.\nO'liva opened just over two years ago with a menu of healthy dishes. A 2015 Express-News review said, \"Chef-owner Chuck Hernandez hits a sweet spot. He aimed to create a restaurant that offers healthful, tasty, internationally inspired and reasonably priced dishes from local ingredients.\n\"For the most part, he and his team hit their mark and sometimes overshoot it. His nicely balanced dishes feel comfortable and accessible, whether they're served for breakfast, lunch or dinner.\" It was awarded 1 1/2 stars, between good and very good.\nIn October, this was posted on the O'liva Facebook page: \"We are sorry to announce that O'liva has officially closed its doors. Thanks to all who have been with us on this fantastic journey!\"\nFratello's at 2503 Broadway has been a local favorite for years. A 2013 Express-News review said, \"Creamy, herbaceous with just a touch of sweetness \u2014 the ricotta filling in the Lasagne Napoletana al' Forno at Fratello's has the power to evoke rhapsodies of joy.\"\nIts food scored three stars under a previous star system, ranking it very good.\nThe new location, with shiny wood floors, and with tables and glassware seemingly ready to go, is part of the renovated Plaza de Armas building, situated between City Hall and San Pedro Creek.\nMagaro explained that before San Francesco Di Paola Church was built in 1927 on the northern stretch of downtown by West Martin and North Santa Rosa streets, most Italian immigrants attended San Fernando Cathedral in Main Plaza, near the new Fratello's location.\n\"So it feels like a homecoming,\" Magarao said. \"It's all home cooking and (the owners') family recipes.\"\nThe new space is about the same size as the Broadway location, but the earlier hours means it will be available for special evening events -- something that's not an option on Broadway.\nA new quick breakfast/lunch option downtown will be its own special event when it opens.\n\u2014 Emily Spicer\nespicer@express-news.net\nTwitter: @Spiced1\nInstagram: @spiceoflife_en", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/24/45/42/5396623/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/42/10/27/8947178/13/920x920.jpg", "https://twitter.com/spiced1", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/60/46/46/12741047/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/42/10/27/8947180/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/42/10/27/8947183/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/24/45/42/5396624/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/60/46/46/12741038/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/24/45/42/5396619/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/24/45/42/5396623/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/25/13/40/5552161/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/42/10/27/8947178/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/57/62/74/12529423/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/42/10/27/8947179/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/60/46/46/12741040/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/24/45/42/5396619/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/24/45/42/5396624/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/25/13/40/5552161/3/920x920.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/spiceoflife_en/", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/42/10/27/8947183/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.fratellosdeli.com/", "http://www.expressnews.com/food/restaurants/article/Restaurant-review-O-liva-6627776.php?t=b66cf0325825164178&cmpid=twitter-premium", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/43/03/10891517/16/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/60/46/46/12741047/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/43/03/10891517/16/920x920.jpg", "http://www.expressnews.com/food/restaurants/article/Review-Fratello-s-Italian-Market-Deli-4944170.php?t=fa9ee3ced525164178&cmpid=twitter-premium", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/42/10/27/8947184/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/43/42/34/9316101/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/42/10/27/8947182/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/57/62/74/12529423/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/43/42/34/9316101/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/42/10/27/8947180/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/60/46/46/12741038/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/42/10/27/8947184/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/60/46/46/12741040/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/42/10/27/8947182/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/42/10/27/8947179/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.fratellosdeli.com/Pages/Menu.aspx?DeptID=0"], "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "f8b3cf86621a9d01e4b037d797c9153b54e7bb00", "highlightText": "", "rating": null}]
