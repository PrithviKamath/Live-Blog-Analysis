Seven-week nomination period to run from Sunday 16 April to Saturday 3 June 
Abu Dhabi, Sunday 16 April, 2017Abu Dhabi Awards, a Government initiative that honours individuals who have selflessly dedicated themselves to helping others and contributed to the development of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, are calling for nominations for its 2017 edition. As the Emirate’s highest civilian honour that can be given to anyone who has made a positive impact on Abu Dhabi, the Awards celebrate goodness and strive to inspire a community of good deeds within the Emirate. For the 2017 edition, the nomination period will run from Sunday 16 April to Saturday 3 June. 
Keen to preserve the legacy of this nation's late founding father, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Abu Dhabi Awards were established in 2005 upon the directive of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates. Held under the guidance and patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, the prestigious Abu Dhabi Awards encourage the citizens and residents of Abu Dhabi to nominate people who have undertaken a good deed that has benefited the community whether in Al Ain region, Al Dhafra region or Abu Dhabi city. Nominees can include Abu Dhabi citizens, residents and non-residents as well as those who live overseas, as long as they have contributed to the development of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. 
This year it’s even easier to nominate, with several ways for people to have their say: 

Via the Facebook page www.facebook.com/abudhabiawards Advertisement 8 In-mall stands and 40 collection centres across the Capital, Al Ain and the Al Dhafra region 
Via the call centre on 800 3331 
Speaking at the launch of this year’s edition, Mr. Abdulnaser Al Rashedi, member of the Abu Dhabi Awards Organising Committee, said: “We encourage everyone to nominate those who have selflessly dedicated themselves to helping others and inspired the community of Abu Dhabi city, Al Ain region or Al Dhafra region.” 
“One nomination is all it takes to recognise this act of giving. We hope that people from across the Emirate will join with us to nominate and recognise the good amongst us”. 
Since their inception in 2005, the Abu Dhabi Awards have recognised 71 unsung heroes who have made a positive impact on society in the Emirate. Nominations total almost a quarter of a million to date, representing 135 nationalities. The contributions from past Award recipients have covered several different areas; from medical research and lifetime achievements to overseas humanitarian relief and the preservation of UAE and Abu Dhabi culture and history. 
Once the nomination period closes, all entries will be evaluated by the Abu Dhabi Awards Organising Committee, comprising leading dignitaries, officials and senior industry figures, who will produce a shortlist of the most qualified candidates. The Committee then further examines each of these nominations, while creating a detailed study on the work and contribution of each of the individuals. Following a rigorous review process the recipients will be selected and announced at the official Abu Dhabi Awards ceremony in early 2018.

A rift between United States President Donald Trump and the rest of the Group of Seven (G7) leading economies over his hard-line position on climate change looks set to widen next month when leaders meet in Italy. 
Energy ministers from Canada, France, Germany and others members of the G7 took the unusual step of declining to issue a joint statement after a meeting in Rome this week, saying the US was not ready to endorse language upholding the United Nations sponsored Paris Agreement. 
Bloomberg newsagency reports the move gives President Trump’s administration time to determine whether to follow through on a campaign pledge to abandon the landmark climate agreement, brokered in 2015 by more than 190 nations. 
It also indicates that other nations are unwilling to drop climate change from the G7 agenda, setting up a potential showdown when President Trump attends his first summit with other world leaders in Taormina, Sicily, on May 26-27. 
“The leaders’ summit is the deadline,” said Dr Alden Meyer, who has followed international climate talks for two decades as director of policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. 
“If President Trump walks into that meeting saying he still doesn’t have a position, I think that would be the end of the line for the other countries.” 
The potential confrontation comes as world leaders have been largely silent, as President Trump, who has called global warming a hoax, has issued sweeping orders to gut environmental regulations. 
The president plans to determine next month whether to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement. 
Bloomberg reports instead of publicly confronting President Trump, Germany and others have tried to use international pressure at G7 and G20 meetings to convince his cabinet members to work with the rest of the world to fight climate change. 
G7 nations hold significant leverage as Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom are among America’s most important economic and military allies. 
“They are not going to let this be brushed under the rug,” Todd Stern, who helped shape the Paris accord as US special envoy for climate change under President Barack Obama, said in an interview. 
“Climate change is a consequential issue, and Paris is the international expression of it. They are not going to paper that over.” 
As host of this year’s G7 meetings, Italy pushed to include language supporting the Paris accord in a joint statement drafted for this week’s meeting of energy ministers. 
Past communiques have included similar language, but US Energy Secretary Rick Perry objected, saying President Trump had not made up his mind, according to a G7 negotiator. 
Rather than rewriting the statement to appease the US, the other nations scrapped it altogether. 
In its place, Italy issued a statement of its own. 
It singled out the US, saying America was ”reviewing many of its policies and reserves its position on this issue.” 
All other G7 members remain committed to the Paris accord, according to the statement. 
“On Paris, it was impossible to sign a joint declaration because United States were not ready to take a clear position,” said Tiziana D’Angelo, a spokeswoman for Italy’s minister of economic development. 
In a statement issued after the meeting, Mr Perry said it was important for nations to continue developing fossil fuel generation, including coal, as well as clean energy. 
He made no direct mention of the Paris Agreement. 
Walking away from the Paris Agreement could isolate the US on multiple fronts, John Kirton, director of the University of Toronto’s G8 Research Group, said in an interview. 
Adding and removing passages from communiques are part and parcel of international diplomacy. 
Bloomberg reports it would be unprecedented, however, if the US ultimately refuses to sign onto a joint statement backed by all other members. 
“That would be a pretty striking development,” Dr Meyer said. 
“The Trump administration is aware that it would put them under a pretty intense spotlight, isolated from the rest of the G7.” TAGS",Trump faces showdown with G7 over climate stance,http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3Lr0eY5j81x9eDb6LD6iKMFVNr7BPFE7loPlmCXk4GD.nYMl631wKZYbThSjvFIDnJMengH.E7bAoxBpv7fCaCvUZGP0hxmHWA-,22db4147cba8b5d303ca2725f8e7975d497293a5,econews.com.au,http://econews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Green-Eiffel-Tower-France-Paris-Agreement.jpg,http://econews.com.au/category/news-to-sustain-our-world/feed,News – Eco News,AU,,0,econews.com.au,1,Trump faces showdown with G7 over climate stance,0.0,news,0,"[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'donald trump'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'trump'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'barack obama'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'perry'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'meyer'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'alden meyer'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'john kirton'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'todd stern'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'rick perry'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'tiziana d’angelo'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'united states'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'japan'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'united kingdom'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'canada'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'sicily'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'rome'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'america'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'italy'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'france'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'taormina'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'germany'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'us'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'paris'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'group of seven'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'g8 research group'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'paris agreement'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'bloomberg'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'united nations'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'us energy'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'university of toronto'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'the trump'}]"

Rajiv Joseph’s 2009 play, Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo is a brilliantly executed exploration of cruelty, violence and redemption, set in Baghdad in the months after the 2003 US invasion. The play mixes moments of tough, brutal realism with surreal passages to stunning effect, and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. 
It’s not the most commercial of fare and, as engrossing and darkly funny as it is, it’s hardly the cheeriest of subjects. So it’s difficult to imagine it would’ve received the attention it’s had if its 2011 Broadway production didn’t star comedy legend Robin Williams in the title role: the tiger. 
Director Claudia Barrie’s production at the Old Fitz Theatre stars stage veteran Maggie Dence in the role, an inquisitive, gruff, and endlessly hungry creature wandering the streets of Baghdad, bearing witness to the ongoing destruction and carnage, and searching for some kind of meaning in it all. 
Joseph focuses in on the conflicts between two soldiers — Tom (Stephen Multari) and Kev (Josh Anderson) — and their Iraqi translator Musa (Andrew Lindqvist). 
Musa worked for several years as a gardener for Saddam Hussein’s violent and tyrannical eldest son Uday (Tyler De Nawi). But Musa’s allegiances shifted after Uday was killed in a raid by US forces. Tom was involved in that raid, and stole a solid gold gun and toilet seat as his trophy. 
“Most of the action ends up taking place somewhere between heaven and earth — a place where there’s time and room to breathe and reflect on what’s meant by the violence unleashed upon this world.” 
The action of the play starts not long after that raid. Tom and Kev have been charged with guarding Baghdad Zoo and the few remaining animals still contained within. It’s a rather low profile job, but proves to be more dangerous than either expected. 
In the opening scene, Dence’s Tiger doesn’t seem entirely at ease behind bars, but her performance galvanises and takes hold with great impact once she’s liberated. And while she’s costumed in simple, tattered civilian human clothes, she does add the occasional feline mannerism into the mix. It’s a prodigious vocal performance and the monologue which opens the second act is deeply moving. 
The acting is excellent across the board, with Stephen Multari and Josh Anderson as very believable US soldiers, trying to hold their lives and psyches together in a world which they can’t possibly understand. Andrew Lindqvist’s Musa is a victim of the violence unleashed by the US soldiers, but reveals a greater strength than might be expected. 
Tyler De Nawi is appropriately terrifying as Uday, while Megan Smart is outstanding as Musa’s sister, and Aanisa Vylet impresses in dual roles. 
Barrie’s production is finely emotionally wrought, and she makes plenty of confident and bold directorial choices — from the very welcome casting of a woman in the role of the tiger (the play could otherwise turn out a bit relentlessly blokey), to the use of the ensemble, echoing and reflecting back the movements and emotional turns of the characters downstage. Some of those choices feel a little overworked: having actors play the magnificent topiary animals crafted by Musa is a strong visual statement, but they’re a little overused. 
But that never takes you out of the world of the play, which is conjured up in magical ways by Isabel Hudson’s simple cyclone wire set, Benjamin Brockman’s colourful, otherworldly lighting and Nate Edmondson’s atmospheric and surprisingly understated sound design. 
Most of the action ends up taking place somewhere between heaven and earth — a place where there’s time and room to breathe and reflect on what’s meant by the violence unleashed upon this world. The questions Joseph is able to ask in that place remain entirely relevant as the US looks to again flex its military muscles. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem like many lessons have been learnt.

The administration of United States President Donald Trump has spoiled efforts by the Group of Seven industrialised countries to reach a common stance on energy when it asked for more time to work out its policies on climate change. 
President Trump signed an order in March to undo climate change regulations drawn up under his predecessor President Barack Obama, calling into question US support for an international deal to fight global warming. 
Reuters Newsagency reports the order’s main target was President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, requiring states to slash carbon emissions from power plants. 
That action was a key factor in US ability to meet commitments under the United Nations sponsored Paris Agreement on climate change reached by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015. 
At a news conference wrapping up the G7 Energy meeting in Rome, Italian industry and energy minister Carlo Calenda said the US was reviewing its strategy on climate change and the Paris Agreement. 
“While this is under way, the US reserves its position on these key priorities,” he said. 
“It was not possible to sign a joint declaration since it would not cover the whole range of topics in the agenda.” 
Mr Calenda, who chaired the G7 meeting, said all other European Union countries remained strongly committed to the Paris Agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions. 
Speaking from Madrid later, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said Europe would “respect everyone’s opinion on the matter but it would not accept making any steps backward with respect to the strategic choices made on climate change”. 
Mr Gentiloni is due to meet President Trump at a G7 summit Italy will host in Sicily next month, with Italy anxious to get public backing from all leaders on the Paris Agreement. 
Reuters reports a source close to the G7 talks said the inability of US Energy Secretary Rick Perry to commit showed the isolation of the US at the ministerial meeting. 
“The US also wanted to include references to coal and fossil fuels,” the source said. 
During his election campaign, President Trump pledged to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord, arguing it would hurt US business. 
Environmental groups have criticised the administration’s order, arguing it runs dangerously counter to the global trend toward cleaner energy technologies. 
However, Washington has still not spelt out its stance on the Paris Agreement and some officials hope there is room for manoeuvre. 
“The talks were constructive and there was no friction,” Mr Calenda said. 
The Italian minister was due to hold bilateral talks with Mr Perry later.

Hai beauties! Welcome to my blog again J 

Kali ini aku mau berbagi cerita tentang pengalaman aku memakai ACNE PATCH, ituloh, yang buat nge hide atau menyamarkan dan menyembuhkan jerawat kita dalam bentuk patch, sampai akhirnya aku bertemu dengan acne patch dari derma angel. Kira-kira acne patch dari derma angel ini sama saja denga acne patch yang lainnya atau berbeda ya? Hmm daripada menebak-nebak, ayo baca review mengenai ACNE PATCH DERMA ANGEL di post aku kali ini J 






 Tipe kulit pada wajah aku adalah oily, dan sensitif. Sekarang udah mulai membaik loh, dulu tipe kulit wajah ku acne, oily, dan sensitif. Jerawat ada dimana-mana baik itu ketika pms dan gak pms. Namun sekarang jerawat aku juga gak hilang total. Kadang mereka masih muncul satu persatu :â€?D. Nah jerawat yang muncul satu persatu itu bukan dalam ukuran kecil loh. Tapi lumayan besar :â€™) kadang jerawat yang besar itu timbul karena aku lagi stress, lagi banyak kegiatan di luar ruangan, gak cocok sama skincare atau masker, dan lain sebagainya. Karena penampakan mereka yang mencolok banget, aku sering gak pede kalau keluar rumah. Mau aku tutupin pake concealar, lama-lama concealar nya juga luntur dan CLING muncullah si jerawat merah nan besar :â€?D 

Dulu aku sempat pake acne patch gitu. Namun aku gak pernah pake ke luar rumah, cuma ketika di rumah saja. Karena bentuk acne patch yang aku pake dulu itu gak transparan, jadinya pasti keliatan walau ditimpa pake make up pun. Gak mungkinlah kan, aku keluar rumah dengan penampakan seperti itu? Bener nggak? Ehheheh Selain itu, acne patch yang pernah aku pake itu juga ternyata gak ada ngaruh apapun ke jerawatku (oke, this is so sad) walau aku memakainya sesuai dengan aturan yang ada pada directionnya, tapi nggak pernah ber-efek kepada jerawatku loh L dan itu gak sekali-dua kali aku make patchnya. Jadinya kayak â€œmubazirâ€? aja gitu ketika aku pake acne patch. Semenjak itu aku nggak pernah pake acne patch lagi kalau ada jerawat yang tumbuh, karna, ya, seperti yang udah aku bilang, percuma aja karena nggak ada hasilnya. 

Sekitar bulan Maret lalu aku nggak sengaja membaca postingan report event dari beberapa orang beauty blogger di media sosial. Ada acne patch baru dengan merk derma angel yang launching di Indonesia. Ketika aku membaca informasi-informasi tentang derma angel, aku sangat tertarik dengan sistem heal and hidenya. Tak hanya menyembuhkan jerawat, namun juga dapat dipakai pada kegiatan sehari-hari dan dapat juga digunakan dengan menggunakan make up. 
 Honestly, aku agak takut loh kalo mengaplikasikan make up di daerah yang berada dekat dengan jerawat. Karena aku takutnya jerawat tersebut dapat menjadi lebih kotor dan iritasi karena penggunaan makeup atau pada saat removing make up yang ternyata kurang bersih (who knows kan?) 
Nah dengan acne patch derma angel dengan sistem heal and hide dan dapat digunakan ketika memakai make up, i think itâ€™s such a brilliant idea :â€?) tak hanya menyembuhkan jerawat, menutupi jerawat, namun juga dapat â€œmenjagaâ€? jerawat dari make up maupun debu dari lingkungan sekitar. 
varian derma angel (source : blogger perempuan) 


APA SIH ITU ACNE PATCH DERMA ANGEL? 
Nah, buat kamu yang belum tahu, aku ada sedikit info mengenai derma angel nih. Derma Angel adalah acne patch kasat mata (transparan) yang menawarkan perawatan lengkap dengan fungsi â€œheal & hideâ€? menyembuhkan jerawat dalam waktu 12 jam dan menyembunyikan jerawat agar terhindar dari bakteri dan paparan polusi eksternal, sehingga sangat praktis dan mendukung wanita Indonesia tampil cantik dan percaya diri dalam menjalankan kegiatan sehari-hari. Brand ini memiliki fitur unik yang mudah digunakan dan menyatu dengan baik pada riasan wajah dan warna kulit yang natural. Derma Angel merupakan penjualan produk No.1 di Cina dan No.2 di Thailand. 

TERUS YANG BIKIN BEDA DERMA ANGEL ACNE PATCH DENGAN YANG LAIN APA? BUKANNYA SEMUA ACNE PATCH SAMA AJA? 

  Derma Angel memberikan kondisi yang ideal untuk proses penyembuhan jerawat, dengan keunikan sebagai berikut: 1. Invisibility (Transparan) â€?                      Sangat tipis dan transparan sehingga memastikan patch menyatu dengan warna kulit alami dan make up. 
2. Anti Acne (Anti jerawat) â€?                      Mengandung bahan hydrocolloid dressing guna penyerapan tinggi yang akan menyerap lebih banyak cairan (nanah). â€?                      Sedikit memblokir UVB untuk mengurangi pigmentasi 
3. Protection (Perlindungan) â€?                      Lapisan luar tahan air (waterproof) yang melindungi kulit dari kontaminasi eksternal (bakteri atau kotoran) yang menyebabkan luka terinfeksi, sementara terus menjaga kebersihan dan higienitas â€?                      Tingkat kerekatan untuk menjaga integritas patch tanpa bergulir (tidak mudah lepas) 


Derma Angel hadir dengan 3 variasi yaitu Day, Night dan Mix patch. 
Varian untuk penggunaan siang hari (Day Use) lebih tipis dibandingkan dengan varian untuk penggunaan malam (Night Use), sehingga lebih terlihat alami dan menyatu dengan riasan wajah. Konsumen dapat menggunakan patch malam bagi yang menginginkan ekstra penyerapan di malam hari. Sementara paket kombinasi (Mix Patch) adalah paket dengan nilai lebih bagi konsumen yang ingin memiliki solusi jerawat lengkap dalam satu kemasan (penggunaan siang dan malam). 


Ketika aku mendapat informasi bahwa derma angel sudah beredar di online shop, aku segera memesan derma angel yang day use via Natural Farm.

Uji Klinis: Pengamatan klinis dilakukan BenQ Medical Center di Fakultas Kedokteran Penyakit Kulit, Universitas Nanjing, Cina pada tahun 2012. Tujuan uji klinis adalah untuk mengevaluasi tingkat keamanan dan efektivitas secara klinis dari hydrocolloid dressing dalam mengatasi permasalahan jerawat dengan tingkat peradangan ringan dan sedang. 
Pengamatan klinis dilakukan terhadap 120 kasus yang terbagi ke dalam dua kelompok eksperimental dan kontrol, dengan menggunakan metode secara acak. Hasilnya adalah selama pengobatan dan setelah 4 minggu terapi, patch jerawat lebih efektif dari 0,025% tretinoin krim yang diaplikasikan pada jerawat. Pada hari ke-7, 10, 14, 17 pengobatan, efek kuratif klinis patch jerawat jelas lebih tinggi dibandingkan tretinoin krim dengan perbedaan yang signifikan secara statistik (P <0,05). Tidak ada efek samping yang jelas diamati pada peserta kelompok. 

Berikut ini merupakan contoh pengaplikasian  Derma Angel Acne Patch yang aku gunakan pada jerawat aku yang ada di dahi. Jerawat tersebut berukuran besar, dan walau terletak di dahi, akan tetap terlihat langsung karena aku tak punya poni, dan walaupun memakai jilbab jerawat tersebut tetap kelihatan. menganggu sekali bukan? 
Fotonya aku kasih watermark, untuk menghindari kemungkinan dipergunakan oleh pihak-pihak di luar derma angel yang tidak bertanggung jawab. 



 Sebelum memakai Derma Angel Acne Patch 

Ketika Memakai Derma Angel Acne Patch 

Setelah pemakaian Derma Angel Acne Patch Day Use selama 12 jam 

Langkah menggunakan Derma Angel: â€?  Langkah 1: bersihkan tangan dan area jerawat, kemudian keringkan â€?  Langkah 2: lepaskan setengah bagian patch dan kemudian tempelkan di area tengah jerawat â€? Langkah 3: Secara halus tekan the patch selama 3-5 detik untuk rekatan yang lebih baik dan transparan. 

Informasi penting: o Segera angkat dan gunakan acne patch yang baru setelah warna patch berubah menjadi putih susu (penuh dengan cairan) atau lebih dari 12 jam pemakaian. o Jangan gunakan patch pada luka terbuka maupun area yang infeksi. o Hentikan pemakaian dan segera konsultasi ke dokter apabila ada efek samping yang timbul seperti pembengkakan, iritasi, atau terasa sakit. o Simpan produk di suhu ruangan dan hindari terpapar oleh sinar matahari secara langsung.

Now, the movie that I want to talk (well, technically to write about) is called ""Same Same but Different"". 
   Have you known that Same Same but Different is a phrase? Well, it is. What does it mean? I don't know it’s significance or if it was a connotation of some sort for something deeper. To me it was the equivalent to saying “Same thing” only slightly cooler. But let's see what google say: 
1. Normally it means something is functionally or substantially the same as something else, but differs in method of implementation, or in minor details. 2.  It is when something is almost the same, but it isn't quite. Or, it can be used sarcastically to compare two things that are radically different. 3. It's used a lot in Thailand, especially in an attempts to sell something but can mean just about anything depending on what the user is trying to achieve.  
    Ya, I've known that phrase long time ago. When I randomly went to instagram, I found that there's a movie using that phrase for its tittle. I was interested by the movie cover. There were an Asian lady with a white guy, and with a tagline written there: A Cambodian ba r girl and A German student, are you ready for the love of your life?       Same Same but Different, is a German film based on the incredible true story of Benjamin Prüfer, a German student who travel led in Cambodia and quickly f ell in love with a young Ca mbodian prostitute, Sreykeo.  
     Oops, does it happen in real life? A love story between a good student with a prostitute girl? Well, the answer is YES. This movie is based on a true story from an article titled “Until death takes her away from me”, that published by German magazine called “Neon”. It turned into a second article, a book ""Perfect Paperback"" or "" Wohin du auch gehst"" in Deutsch.  
    “Tourist from a western, industrialized country falls in love with an Asian prostitute”. A common occurence which happens a thousand times every day, again and again. So what makes Sreykeo, Benjamin and their story so different? 
     But first, let me introduce the casts to you guys:

Cast: 
David Kross as Ben jamin Prüfer 
Apinya Sakuljaroensuk as Sreykeo Jens Harzer as Henry Stefan Konarske as Ed  Anne Müller as Claudia  Wanda Badwal as Lilli 

      After his graduation, Benjamin decided to go backpacking through South-East Asia, in his own words “to make my life and myself a bit more interesting”. He ended up in Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia and meets Sreykeo at a 'Heart of Darkness' nightclub. Sreykeo means ""girl made of glass"" and the name suits her, because she really does seem fragile.      When the first time Sreykeo introduced herself to Benjamin as “Rose”, he asked her for her real name. “Sreykeo”. The “Heart of Darkness” was full of bar girls but Benjamin didn’t think about that. He simply thought that she was so different to the girls he’d met up until then. It wasn’t until he woke up next to her in the morning that he realized that she's too, was a prostitute when she told him that she was thinking about whether she should charge him or not. 

     Benjamin didn’t think that this fateful night in the middle of South-East Asia would lead to anything until Sreykeo showed up again at his lodge the next day. After all, this clash of cultures shouldn’t allow a happy ending and like Benjamin’s brother would later put it “She can’t afford love”.  


      Phnom Penh isn’t the Paris of the East, there’s nothing romantic about it. The German boy and the Cambodian prostitute jumped onto the back of a Tuk-tuk and went to meet Sreykeo’s family. Sreykeo’s family lives in an area of the city so weathered and impoverished that the Khmer simply call it “La Building”. Benjamin ended up living at “La Building” for a month, sleeping in the one room with the whole of Sreykeo’s family and also sharing a single toothbrush with the whole family. 
     When Ben was back to German, he still got in touch with Sreykeo trough email, text, and skype. Then, Sreykeo is diagnosed with HIV, and the focus of the film becomes Benjamins struggle and desire to support her and her family, and to get her proper medicine.   
     At the time, Benjamin was working as an intern and part-time editor at the German Financial Times, sending several hundred dollars to Sreykeo through Western Union every month because she still had to support her whole family (including her brother about to become a Buddhist monk and her gambling addicted mother) and he didn’t want her to work as a bar girl anymore (Ben is so sweet, but uh... it's lil bit annoying of Sreykeo. She always asked money and money to Ben. Why didn't she just work by her self? Why didn't she look for a better job? So that, Ben didn't have to bear all cost!) . 
    Benjamin once asked Sreykeo, “Why did you talk to me at The Heart of Darkness?”, “Because you just drink water when I see you. You did not dance with the bargirls. I don’t like men who go to the bargirls,” that was Sreykeo's answer. But that wasn’t the whole truth. She never told him but she told his brother when he came to Cambodia. The day before Benjamin and Sreykeo met, she went to a pond at the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh and released two turtles. A Buddhist ritual. A male turtle and a female turtle. On their shell she had written a prayer in Khmer, asking for a man who would always love her and care for her. She then colored her bleached hair back to black, got her nails done and went into the “Heart of Darkness”. 
    ""Same Same but Different"" is a film about love, the subject of a thousand films, but it is different, haha. The filmmakers let us see a bit of what everyday life in Cambodia is like. Overcrowded, poor, dirty, but somehow still charming and full of soul. It provides a social commentary on the way Westerners exploit the locals in third world countries. This is in contrast to the scenes in Hamburg, where life seems very cold, serious, and loveless. 
     It was just refreshing how this movie was different from all the rest. It wasn’t a usual romance movie. For one, it was set in Phnom Pehn and Germany which very accurately showed the contrast of the third-world and first-world countries. Second, it showed the reality of foreigners finding relations with locals, specifically prostitutes.  
    Here in Indonesia, I (sometimes) see these prostitutes hanging around foreigners. I’m even pretty sure that a lot of the foreigner-local relationships in the country started out the same way Ben and Sreykeo’s relationship had. Third, it depicts the existence of true unconditional love. Ben gave  everything to Sreykeo. And this is a true story!! Which means that there really are people who love like this. It gives everyone hope.   
     I guess, Ben is lovely man. He really takes care of Sreykeo. What captured my attention the most was the first time they met. Sreykeo asked Ben how many candles he would bring with him into a dark cave. He replied that he would bring along ‘two candles’. Sreykeo interpreted for him that he had loved two girls in his entire life. At the end of the movie, Sreykeo asked him again, and he said “one candle”. “What if the candle were blown off?” Srey Keo asked. “Then, I’d carry you forever,” he said. Oh my God, this is too sweet,Ben, haha. 

    Oh I almost forget, despite all the difficulties, today Benjamin and Sreykeo are married and live in Phnom Penh with their two children. Benjamin also went to the pond at the Royal Palace. The turtles are still in there.  The real Sreykeo & Ben with their kids. 
    Anyway, it was a great movie! I suggest people watch it. Not so many people get to appreciate movies like these, being bombarded by American films. You won’t regret the 100 minutes of your life watching this film.

It should come as no surprise that in the aftermath of another night of Honda Center frustration, Brad Treliving was pissed off.

Flames GM,Brad Treliving, just smashed a chair not 5 feet from me — jonathan davis (@westcoasthky) April 16, 2017 
Heck, I'm sure plenty of bar stools in Calgary met a similar fate and nobody has more invested in this team than this guy.

Frustrated with the outcome? For sure.

Mad about some of the decisions made by the players? Probably.

Angry with the calls that went against his team? Of course.

There are numerous reasons for the Flames general manager to be incensed after a 29th straight loss in that arena. In fact, here are 29, one for every setback over this decade-plus stretch of futility.

1. The Non-Goal - This one has to top the list. A key moment in the game came midway through the second period when Sam Bennett fights off the check of Korbinian Holzer to get his stick on a centring pass from Kris Versteeg with the puck eventually trickling into the net in the midst of a frenzy of activity in the crease.

Not called a goal initially on the ice, it went to a video review as the puck did end up in the net. After a lengthy review, it was ruled there had been goalie interference either by Alex Chiasson , who during the skirmish had come in and swiped at the puck and in the process, contacted goaltender John Gibson , or by Bennett (it was not clear), and in the view of the officials, Gibson was prevented from being able to make the save. It's that in-between rule where it's not severe enough to be a goaltender interference penalty, but the goal doesn't count either.

If this sounds familiar, it was two years ago that Bennett also appeared to score in a playoff game against the Ducks, only for that one also to be disallowed. 

While it's certainly a play we could debate in this space for an article in itself and no doubt it will be a hot topic across Flames nation on Sunday, it was needless to say an awfully tough decision to swallow for Calgary because it was ultimately a subjective call that denied them what would have been the go-ahead goal.

After blowing a one-goal lead in game 1, it's hard to believe one of the best teams in the league at keeping leads would have blown a lead again. So yes, that one play was that significant.

2. Elliott's Slow Start - Two goals against on the first six shots. Once again, Calgary falls behind early. Brian Elliott rebounded nicely, shutting the door for exactly 48 and half minutes after that and making 20 consecutive saves in the process -- a handful of dangerous chances thwarted along the way -- but then came that pinball winner off the stick of Ryan Getzlaf , and more so the skate of Lance Bouma .

Agonizing is the fact that with a better start, that fluke goal might have been inconsequential. But instead, it wasn't because of the two that the veteran goalie missed earlier.

The opening goal by Jakob Silfverberg from off the wing, he has to have that one. While there were others to share in the blame on the second goal, a top NHL goalie can't get beat on a wrap-around like that. He just can't.

Calgary scored the next two, but instead of taking a 2-0 lead, that only tied it 2-2, and you know how things turned out.

3. Hamilton's Bad Decision - Jostling with Corey Perry in the neutral zone as Anaheim heads up ice on a rush and with Dougie Hamilton trying to get back in the play, the defenceman ends up grabbing Perry's stick with his glove.

No, it wasn't for very long. Yes, it was blatant. Whistled for two minutes for holding the stick at 14:33 of the third period, Calgary goes to the PK for the first time since Matthew Tkachuk 's high-sticking penalty in the first period. The Ducks need only 41 seconds to take advantage.

Just like that, Anaheim leads with less than five minutes remaining. Whether or not it was the right call or a fair call can and will be debated, but what should not be a debate is in that game situation, you simply can't give the official a reason to raise his hand. It was an unnecessary risk in which the team ended up paying a heavy price.

4. Referee's Questionable Decision - Of course, as mad as you are at your player for unnecessarily giving the officials a reason to make a penalty call there, you're equally mad at the referee tandem of Wes McCauley and Brian Pochmara for making that call.
  
Did that really need to be a penalty in that moment of a 2-2 game? Was it really that egregious of a foul given all the hijinx that had gone uncalled over the previous period and a half? That part is certainly debatable. Could the referee have also sent off Perry for interference and made it coincidental minors? Absolutely.

5. Hockey Gods Aren't Crazy, They Just Dislike Calgary - Regardless of all the variables leading up to the go-ahead goal, the bottom line is it was a total fluke goal and it really makes one wonder if there really is some sort of curse in that building.

Seriously, a harmless centring pass caroms sharply off Bouma's boot, flutters high in the air in the direction of the net and with Elliott having no idea where the puck had gone, like a centre fielder who loses a fly ball in the bright sun, it lands behind him in the net. To quote Jerry Seinfeld, ""That was one magic loogie.""
  
To re-enact that goal, you'd probably need to try it at least a couple hundred times and that would be trying to do it on purpose. That's just the kind of sorcery everyone has come to expect in that building where the 'you'll never believe what happened...' lore continues to grow.

6. Too Many Wasted Chances  - It's not like the Flames didn't have chances to bury the Ducks early in the game.

    They had a couple of breakaways, including Gaudreau bursting in off the wing, but failed to convert each. Set-up on a brilliant fake-shot turned slap-pass by Michael Stone , Sean Monahan failed to got all of his stick on the puck and instead of putting the Flames in front, the puck flipped off his stick and went wide.
  
Two guys being paid handsomely to score big goals. Two guys the Flames need to score big goals if they want to prevail as the underdog in this series. Neither was able to deliver.

Monahan has a pair of goals so far and he's been good. But when you lose two one-goal games, it's the goals that you don't score that end up the talking points.

7. Gaudreau Passes up the Shot - That was the game situation. That's why you gave him a six-year, $40.5 million contract in the off-season.

With the game on the line in the final 30 seconds of regulation, if you could pick one player to have the puck on his tape from 15 feet out, that's the guy you would select.

After Hampus Lindholm uncharacteristically coughs the puck up into the slot, Gaudreau gets a grade 'A' chance in a prime shooting spot. But wait. Rather than shoot, he spins around and sends a no-look backhand pass to the side of the net that doesn't connect.

In game 1, it was Gibson beating Gaudreau in a showdown in the waning seconds by stretching out his pad to stop Gaudreau's backhand as he cut across the crease. In that situation, Gaudreau has to make his World Cup Young Stars teammate beat him a second time.

8. Brouwer's Disappointing Season  - The wait continues and continues.

Safe to say the Flames are still waiting for the 'big game' player to emerge that scored eight times in the playoffs a year ago to get him a $4.5 million paycheque this year. One goal from Brouwer in these first two games sprinkled in anywhere might very well have made the  difference and made this series 1-1 instead of 2-0.

This isn't a guy that will come out of the line-up. This isn't someone that should come out of the line-up. But a decent fourth liner/penalty killer/net-front power play presence isn't good enough for the pay stipend he's cashing. Expectations are commensurate with what you make for a salary in this business and he's making a lot while not contributing a lot.
  
Calgary needs more from him at this point, beyond what he may be contributing off the ice as an alternate captain. Calgary needs way more.

Unfortunately, the fact he opened the playoffs on the fourth line is an indicator of how far his stock has fallen. More and more, you wonder what kind of sweetener it may take -- a top prospect, perhaps -- for Treliving to coax Vegas GM George McPhee into taking in the expansion draft the player he once brought to Washington. Because so far in Calgary, it isn't working out.

9. Brouwer's Disappointing Usage - Late in the season, Micheal Ferland finally got a chance on the top power play unit in place of Brouwer. After all, it made sense as he was already playing at five-on-five with Gaudreau and Monahan.

For many, it was a move long overdue considering how well Ferland has played. Yet, Gulutzan has reverted to the way things were earlier in the season to begin the playoffs and it's been Brouwer in that role once again.

Particularly perplexing was how it played out in game 1 when Ferland was creating chances all night yet still got passed over when the Flames needed that late goal.

Treliving has been very upfront in his time in Calgary to say that he lets his coaches coach. He assembles the roster, brings in the personnel. How the players are deployed is up to the skipper. They chat every day so you know opinions are exchanged, but ultimately it's the coach's call and it has to be. You can't have a GM meddling. That said, you do wonder how Treliving is viewing his prize July 1 signing.

I think with the GM there's a better understanding of what else he brings to the team, he's around the team all the time and you see things that the rest of us don't, but at that salary, intangibles cannot be your biggest contribution.

10. Undisciplined Dougie - Getting back to Hamilton because he's been in the crosshairs and rightly so, that makes four minor penalties for this series.

While it's easy to point to his age -- still a youthful 23 -- and say maybe it's simply the pressure of the Stanley Cup Playoffs getting to a young man, but Ducks blue liners Shea Theodore , Brandon Montour and Lindholm are all younger than Hamilton and have all played fewer NHL games, yet they have played very well. Consistent. Solid.

You can't harp too much on Hamilton because he was such a key part of the Flames resurgence. When he and Mark Giordano were paired together on Nov. 15 for the first time, that's when Calgary's season took off. But that version of Hamilton is what Calgary badly needs to show up in this series right away. He's too important of a piece.

11. Brodie Snaps at the Wrong Time - You don't see TJ Brodie get mad very often. But sure enough, Kesler -- not surprisingly -- is a guy that does it and it was costly on Saturday night.

Brodie's cross-check to the back of Kesler while he was already down put the Flames back on the penalty kill with less than three minutes remaining in the game. Now down a goal, they were going to have to manufacture a comeback while playing four-against-five. Not good. It may not have fatally killed Calgary's comeback hopes, but it seriously wounded them.

This feud isn't new.

You may recall back at the Saddledome on Dec. 29, 2015, after Kesler shot the puck into the empty net after the final buzzer went, Brodie was as furious as I've seen him, shouldering Kesler into the boards afterwards and sparking a small melee.

Was it uncharacteristic? Yes. Was it rare? Yes. But is he still accountable for it? Has to be. It took two big minutes off the clock.

12. Ryan Kesler - Speak of the devil. If you live in Calgary, it's just part of living in this city. You have to have a strong dislike for the Anaheim centre. Presumably the feelings aren't much different for Treliving.

Kesler is a monster in the playoffs, an absolute force, who owns the Flames. Great at the dot, dangerous with the puck, difficult to play against, a master in getting under the skin of the opposition and that smirk afterwards -- it must drive guys crazy.

The Flames can only dream that Matthew Tkachuk will one day have a similar type of presence and impact in that coveted but hard-to-fill role of an antagonist that your team and fan base loves, but everybody else hates. 

13. Damn Nashville - As we got into the final week of the season, the team that most felt Calgary would match up better against, despite them having the best record in the Western Conference, despite their three Stanley Cups in the last seven years, was the Chicago Blackhawks.

As if he was doing all he could to facilitate that match-up, Gulutzan sat out the likes of Mikael Backlund , Mark Giordano and Kris Versteeg for the Flames regular season finale too. A win by Nashville in Winnipeg on that Saturday, as the Predators pursued third place in the Central, combined with a Calgary loss, would have resulted in the Flames travelling to Illinois instead. To save you looking it up, the last time Calgary won in the United Centre was last October. No curse to be found in that arena and that alone was a reason to crave that match-up.

But instead, the Predators found out during their game that third place and a match-up with Minesota was no longer within reach after the Blues clinched it with a win over Carolina. Shortly after in real time, Nashville promptly gave up two goals in the last half of the third period -- the final one shorthanded with 45 seconds left -- to lose 2-1 to Winnipeg in regulation and draw Chicago instead of Anaheim.

In case you haven't noticed, the Predators just took a 2-0 series lead winning twice in Chicago and not giving up a goal. Safe to say the Flames wish they played at 7 pm Central time last night.

14. History Says You're Screwed - Sure, they played well. Yes, if they can only eliminate some mistakes they can defeat the Ducks. But the bottom line is the team has to win four of the next five to win the series and the odds of that are not good.

In fact, in franchise history, Calgary has never overcome a 2-0 deficit. They've been in that situation nine times and are 0-9. Sure, all streaks must come to an end eventually, but where have I heard that before! Until it happens, hard to expect it to happen.

15. Oilers Won - You know the salt in the wound for the front office especially is that the Oilers and their fancy, new rink that they're not shy to flaunt in front of Calgary, did win their game 2, then won again on Sunday night to take a 2-1 lead.

Three hours up the highway from Calgary, Edmonton's fanbase is going nuts, the entire city has turned orange. It's bedlam and in a good way. Meanwhile, the Flames return to what's now the second-oldest arena in the NHL, and while there is plenty of colour in our city too -- most of the red today is people's faces. So much anger. So much frustration.

Losing in the first round will sting a lot less for the underdog Flames if the favourite Oilers lose too, but we'll have to wait and see on that -- and I have my doubts it will happen. If Edmonton gets on a roll, expect the C of Red in Calgary to really grow, and I'm not talking about the size of the crowd at the Saddledome.

16. The Runt of Canada's Litter - Not only did Edmonton win, but so did Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal -- all of them overcoming a 1-0 deficit. Of Canada's post-season participants, only the Flames are heading to game 3 down 2-0 in the series and that must drive the front office crazy.
 
Treliving can see the hype going on in Alberta's provincial capital, out East with the Maple Leafs as they arrive home, the exhileration in Montreal with the Habs surging in front 2-1 in its series.
   
When you see the impact those game 2 (and game 3) wins have had in those markets, on those teams, you yearn to keep up with them and do the same. Failing to do so must leave a pit in his stomach. Instead of a jubilant Sunday in Calgary, a real buzz around town, there's a lot of anger and frustration. You know what sells tickets, jersey and merchandise? Not that.

17. So Many Blown Opportunities to End 'It' - Despite how often they adamantly say they don't pay attention to the streak and to them, it's just a another game against Anaheim, I don't believe it.

If you're a player, how can you not wonder to yourself what it's going to take to win there. Going back to the last regular season game in Honda Center in which they dominated and took a lead in the first period, that's three times in a span of 12 days they've had a great opportunity to win there and remove that oversized mental baggage, and each time they've blown it.

So often, teams talk about confidence and players talk about confidence and they always emphasize how important it is. Well, how can this team have any confidence whatsoever that they're going to win in a building they've lost in 29 times in a row? They say they're not thinking about it and while that's the correct and expected answer publicly, I call bull shit. Until they win there, it will always be a distraction no matter how vehemently the players try to deny it.

18. That Line Change - Yes, it happened two nights ago but that dreadful wholesale line change by the Bennett-Versteeg-Chiasson line and Bartkowski-Engelland D pairing that cost the Flames the lead in game 1, it must still stick in the craw of the GM. Heck, it will be an agonizing memory 20 years from now.

19. Wrong Guy Shooting - One of the attributes we heard about Stone when he arrived a couple weeks prior to the trade deadline was he had a heavy shot. Reportedly, he can really rip a slapshot. I say ""reportedly"" in that we've rarely seen it. Too often, it ends up being Brodie taking the shots and that's definitely not his forte.

By all means, make No. 7 the quarterback on the power play. Let Brodie be the puck mover on that pairing that heads up ice with the puck, but when you do get set-up at five-on-five in their zone, it should be Brodie getting it to Stone, not vice versa. Brodie's shots are like a guy flinging a frisbee and Gibson, who looks like a guy that has spent time catching frisbees on So-Cal beaches, is having little trouble repelling them.

Last year in Arizona when Stone had a solid season, he averaged nearly three minutes per game on the power play. In his 21 games with Calgary, he's played a little over six minutes total on the man advantage. It's too late in the season to change the power play but having a guy that can bomb a shot from the blue line -- like Al MacInnis in the glory days -- is an ingredient absent from that first power play unit.

20. Tkachuk Double Minor - It didn't hurt the team. In fact, it ultimately ended up helping them.

Tkachuk's double-minor for accidentally high-sticking Patrick Eaves in the beard put the Flames down a man with two minutes to go in the first period of a game they already trailed 2-0. Instead, Backlund's shorthanded goal 22 seconds into the penalty started Calgary's comeback.

Yet, it still had to irritate Treliving that a four-minute high-sticking call was given instead of a two-minute penalty. There was no blood, it was accidental and it's not like Eaves was injured. Heck, he remained on the ice to start the power play. Didn't even miss a shift. That's got to be irritating.

21. Squandered Comebacks - Despite everything they're up against -- that building, playing a very good team that has won the Pacific Division five years in a row, falling behind each game to a team that during the regular season was 33-7-5 -- 7th best in the NHL -- when scoring first, the Flames deserve full credit for each time, staying the course and eventually erasing their early deficit.

In game 1, it was overcoming a 1-0 hole just 52 seconds in. In game 2, it was rallying back from a 2-0 deficit less than seven minutes in.

But the kick to the groin is that in both instances, all that work in battling back, all that energy expelled, all went for naught as after getting the game back to even or even briefly taking the lead in game 1, they gave it away again.

The worst part, they served Anaheim the knock-out blows on a platter on both nights. A bad line change and that unnecessary goaltender interference penalty by Bouma in game 1. An ill-timed penalty by Hamilton in game 2. Just like that, they were chasing the game again and you're only going to come back against a tough team like Anaheim so often.

22. Can't Win the Opening 40 Minutes - The Flames don't even have to win a three-period game. They've shown all season that they just need to win the first two periods. That's it.

It's like Calgary has Mariano Rivera in the bullpen yet he's out there doing nothing but eating sunflower seeds so far because the team can't get him a lead.

No team in the regular season was better at locking down a lead after two periods than the Flames, who went 33-0-1 in that scenario for a .971 winning percentage. The one overtime loss was in the third game of the season. After that, they successfully converted 33 second period leads in a row.

But this series, bad starts have been costly as it's resulted in them chasing a deficit, not protecting a lead. In game 1, they trailed 3-2 after two periods. Despite opportunities to take the lead on Saturday, it was 2-2 after 40 minutes.

23. Schooled at the Dot - Not only have they been chasing the game, they've also been chasing the puck. After two games, the Flames have the worst face-off percentage in the playoffs at 39.0 percent. Most of the time it goes like this: Puck is down, Ducks have it, Calgary is forced to defend.
   
Not a single Ducks player is below 50 percent:
Wagner, 8-3, 72.7% Getzlaf, 24-10, 70.6% Vermette, 19-13, 59.4% Thompson, 11-8, 57.9% Kesler, 25-21, 54.4% As you might expect, not one Flames player is above 50 percent:
Brouwer, 7-9, 43.8% Bennett, 10-15, 40.0% Backlund, 18-29, 38.3% Monahan, 13-21, 38.2% Stajan, 6-12, 33.3% 
Brouwer's odd presence at the top of Calgary's list speaks to why he's still the guy on the power play over Ferland. As a right-shot, he's fared the best of any Flames center against the Ducks predominantly-right group of pivots. It's like a baseball match-up, only the opposite. If you're not having success lefty versus righty, try righty versus righty.

It raises the question of how can you get better in this area? Does the centre need to go for a tie-up and you ask for more from your wingers? It's an area that is hurting Calgary and they need to find a way of being better in this area.

24. Can't Take Advantage of Depleted Ducks Blue Line - Nearly $16 million worth of defencemen were missing from Anaheim's blue line in game 2. Wow.

Never mind the $7 million absent in Simon Despres and Clayton Stoner , both on LTIR, the Ducks were missing an additional $8.9 million worth of experience from the back end on Saturday night with Sami Vatanen (upper body) a late scratch, joining the already-injured Cam Fowler (lower body). That's two of their top three players in ice time this season M.I.A.

Yet with 21-year-old Shea Theodore in the line-up and logging 20-plus minutes, 29-year-old journeyman Korbinian Holzer pressed into action, Calgary still could not take advantage. Lindholm played over 26 minutes to anchor the blue line and they got enough out of aging Kevin Bieksa , young  Brandon Montour and just-getting-going  Josh Manson .

A big-time wasted opportunity.

25. Bouma Simply Cannot Score - You know Treliving has learned from the Bouma situation two summers ago, not to overpay for one-hit wonders. You saw that in the treatment of Joe Colborne last off-season.

But again, that doesn't make it any easier to accept.

This is guy making north of $2 million who simply has lost his scoring touch altogether. Did he ever have a scoring touch to begin with? That's the key question and it's looking increasingly like the answer is probably not and that's at the root of this.

Because the Flames' chances of winning would go up if he could finish off some of the chances he gets.
   
In the second period, shortly after Monahan had tied it 2-2, Bouma gets the puck in a scramble with Gibson down and out in the crease. Just roof it, or even elevate it at all and the Flames lead.

Instead, he shovels it into Gibson's glove.

In another chance, Brouwer's hot shot isn't handled by Gibson but the rebound goes right past Bouma as he heads to the net. Had he anticipated the rebound better, stick down and ready, maybe he buries it instead.

Bouma's been fine as a fourth liner but that would be if he was making $750,000. At the freight he's earning, you need more. Still one more year to go on that deal also.

26. General Player Usage - As much as the fourth line was bringing energy and all that, there was still far too much of that line in a must-win game.

They're rarely going to score. It's time to ride your horses that have and will . Every game in this series has been gruelling, no denying that, but there's been no overtime and the team had four days off prior to the series beginning. For a guy like Backlund, he had six days off prior.
   
In a must-win game like last night, don't you need to go with the core guys that got you there a bit more? That's the 3M line, that's the Monahan line. Gulutzan is using his fourth line like he's preparing for a long series but that spread-out ice time will have no long-term benefit if the Flames are swept in four games.

 
27. Chasing the Game, Again  - The degree of difficulty of winning is so high when you're constantly chasing the game. Giving up the first goal of the game has been a chronic issue with this team all season and that hasn't changed in the post-season.

The Flames have shown an ability to bounce back and they settled in to the game nicely again last night, carrying the play big time after the halfway point in the first period. But they've got to find a way to be better prepared -- both as a team, and individually (i.e. Elliott), -- to get through the first 10 minutes at 0-0. Do that and the odds of winning go up exponentially.

 
28. Series is Slipping Out of Your Control  - There is no doubt the Flames can outplay Anaheim in four of the next five games. They have the personnel to be able to do that. They have shown they can do that. The first two games have been that close.

Bu t now what they're up against is how often do you outplay a team and still lose? It happens quite a bit. Now, not only do you need to be very good, but you also have to have some luck because often, the best team doesn't always win. Calgary is in a situation where they essentially have to play four perfect games.
 
Gibson has the ability to steal a game and they can't let that happen. Getzlaf has the ability to win a game on his own and they can't let that happen.

They're going to have to play nearly flawless hockey plus get help from above to pull this series out. That's asking a lot from the hockey gods, who evidently aren't big fans of you.

29. Snowing in Calgary - And after all that, with so many things to stew about, then you've got to leave the palm trees and sunshine of California and return to Calgary, where snow has covered your car while you were away.

Chances are, like so many of us fools, Treliving already put the snow brush in the garage too, so he's out there with his sleeve pulled down and shivering fingers, sweeping off the windshield. Lovely. Just wonderful.

Find out how Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom shapes up on Sony's console in our review. By John-Paul Jones on 18 April 2017 Even in its earliest released screenshots, there was something pleasantly infectious about Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom . Whether it was the retina strokingly wide gamut of colours, the fluffy protagonists or just the sheer, wide-eyed anime spectacle of it all, it was clear that indie developer Enigami was onto something rather special. Now with the finished product in our hands, it's refreshing to discover that such early promise has been delivered upon, even if the end result remains a little rough around the edges. A loving homage to the JRPGs of the past Cast as Chado and Poki, members of the Waki, which are essentially a race of bipedal dogs with extra cuteness to spare, Shiness begins with our furry heroes having crash-landed their makeshift airship into an idyllic-looking, if seemingly foreboding forest. From here, both the narrative and the world expands grandly outward as we discover that a nihilistic elemental force known as the Dark Shi has seeped into reality and it's up to our raucous duo, and the new friends that they make along the way, to put a stop to this evil before it's too late. Ostensibly, while the plot in Shiness is regurgitated JRPG fluff at its finest, there is still plenty of entertainment to be had with the cast of characters and the numerous fantastical events that unfurl around them. Most of all, the setting proves to be especially intriguing, taking place in a world that has been shattered into a series of colourful elemental islands, Shiness is certainly not lacking in imaginatively realised realms for the player to traipse about in during its substantial duration. Keeping things very much in line with its Japanese influences, cutscenes and story transitions are presented as a series of stylish animated manga panels, which also add further layers to its modish aesthetic. Beyond the obvious visual kinship with earlier titles such as Eternal Sonata , and even more recent Cyberconnect 2's Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm series, Shiness plays very much like a combination of the those two genre examples, meshing real-time combat and exploration with just enough depth to keep even the most stalwart JRPG veterans happy. Starting with the exploration side of things, Chado, Poki and their extended party of friends traverse the world of Shiness from the third-person, as a roving camera provides effortless control over their exploratory pursuits. Luckily, 'effortless' is just what you'll need, too, since Shiness doesn't just have the player idly wandering about, but also indulging in a touch of platforming and puzzle solving as well. A world away from the annoying, player-hostile camera seen in the Kingdom Hearts games, leaping about the place in Shiness actually proves to be both an enjoyable and easily accomplished feat as the perspective never proves to be a detriment to the on-screen section. In regards to the puzzles you'll come across, Shiness tasks the player with using the various elemental abilities of each character to solve its myriad of conundrums in a number of different ways. Chado, for example, can channel his earthly elemental powers to fashion boulders out of thin air, using them to weigh down pressure pads, while later addition to the group, Kayenne, has telekinetic powers that allow him to move particular objects into place. By themselves, these abilities are largely unremarkable and don't lend themselves to especially brain tickling problems. Later in the game however, puzzles require that the player combines all of them to proceed and in doing so makes the exploration side of Shiness far more interesting than it would otherwise be; especially when it comes to using these abilities to unearth secrets from previously missed or inaccessible areas. The elemental powers that the protagonists wield in Shiness also extends to the manner in which they use them to smack enemies in the face, too. Split between melee and ranged combat styles, each character can open up a can on their foes with the elemental masteries that they have at their disposal, with opposing elements, water against fire enemies for instance, dealing far more damage than they otherwise would. Sure enough, while it may seem like JRPG Combat 101 on the surface, there is a little more depth to it than that. First off, these ranged elemental attacks cannot be used endlessly, since each time one is used the corresponding element resource is reduced, necessitating the employ of either finite items, or, a period of meditation to replenish these powers. Where things get all 'Catch 22' however, is that while meditating you can not only still be attacked (the combat is in real-time after all), but meditation can only resupply the element you're short on if the colour of the arena you are fighting in matches it (water is blue, earth is brown/gold and so on). As such, when combat actually happens, it takes places within a dome of ever changing colours which not only acts as an indicator for replenishing your elemental powers, but also provides tangible physical boundaries to the contests of violence that unfold within it. While it's true that your elemental powers cannot be used ad infinitum, your fists and feet thankfully can and it's here that Shiness feels much more akin to the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm games as the player chains together combinations of flashy looking melee strikes to defeat their foe. Here, the all-important Tension meter is key to your success. Replenished by both landing attacks on your foe and getting hit by them in turn, players can time a Tension-sapping parry at the time their opponent launches an attack; either reflecting their ranged elemental attack back at them, or, leaving them open to a counter. Another use of Tension is the QTE-powered Hyper Attacks that it enables when the latter has been maxed out, allowing the player to deal considerable amounts of elemental damage, assuming the correct button commands have been inputted. Most notably, in both cases Tension encourages the player to consider tactical use of it; prioritising parries or Hyper attacks depending on the enemies that are in front of them, though fortunately only one enemy can ever attack you at a single time. Sitting atop the ranged and melee combat of Shiness is the support and mastery system, which in turn make the face-smacking portions of Enigami's inaugural effort far more deceptively deep than they initially appear, as while the player can only have one active fighter at any one time, the other members of the party can be used in support roles, either healing or buffing the active fighter accordingly. The mastery system, on the other hand, allows each member of the group to use collectible scrolls called Disciplines to specialise in a range of different elemental attacks, which not only give stat boosts and new attacks for your characters, but also provide the robust backbone to the progression system that Shiness holds at its core. A few flaws hold it back from greatness Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom then, is quite the prospect: a passionately crafted effort which manages to invigorate the action JRPG of yesteryear with surprising efficacy and a strong degree of considered quality. Unfortunately, it is however not without its fair share of flaws that keep it just shy of greatness. Of these detractions, the most obvious is that Shiness doesn't really do anything we haven't seen before. Indeed, large parts of its design crib liberally from similar titles both past and present, and while developer Enigami has made no secret of wearing such influences on its sleeve, the sum still remains a game that is far more content to look to the path that has already been trodden in lieu of striking out on new and potentially innovative ground on its own. Another issue that sticks out more than it should is the quality of the writing. While the narrative is pretty much as straightforward as you can get, of which that shouldn't be a problem by itself, the dialogue certainly leaves a lot to be desired as it frequently errs towards the overly hammy and, very occasionally, the downright cringeworthy. After all, there's only so many over-the-top dramatic laughing villain tropes you can take before your eyes roll painfully into the back of your skull. Elsewhere, while there's no doubt that Shiness boasts some great art direction and an assortment of lush, vibrant worlds for the player to navigate, it's clear that the budget the studio had (lest we forget, Shiness did begin life on Kickstarter after all), only managed to stretch so far. Built upon the distinctly wrinkly foundations of Unreal Engine 3 , Shiness has a collection of visual glitches that irritate throughout. Whether that's character models occasionally clipping through the scenery, the odd floating object that shouldn't be floating, or jerky and abrupt transitions between combat and exploration, it's clear that though Shiness punches way above its belt, it still doesn't quite boast the level of polish typified by its more expensive and more established AAA counterparts. In Summary A real callback to an earlier era where JRPG's on PlayStation weren't afraid to indulge in explosive colour palettes and equally brash doses of action spectacle, Shiness does enough right that fans of that time will find themselves well served by what developer Enigami has wrought here. Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom Review by John-Paul Jones -The Final Word- An indie adventure with far Eastern inspirations that does a great job of masquerading as a big budget spectacular, Shiness will delight those looking for a fix of action RPG goodness with one eye on the classics of yore.

Vi-Slim Metab Awake is a metabolism boosting weight loss aid that contains several ingredients that are natural sources of caffeine. It is intended to be used alongside other products from the ViSalus range, including meal replacement shakes. Vi-Slim Metab Awake Facts 30 capsules per bottle Contains unknown quantity of caffeine 
Vi-Slim Metab Awake is manufactured by ViSalus, a Multi-Level Marketing company who are based in the USA. The company can be contacted using the information found on their official website. Customers are likely to be encouraged to contact their own distributer to deal with any issues first, rather than being able to deal with customer service directly. How to Take Vi-Slim Metab Awake 
The directions for use (according to one distributer) are as follows: “Take 1 to 2 tablets, once to twice per day. Do not exceed 4 tablets per day. Taking more than the maximum will not add additional benefits. If you experience gas, or stomach rumbling, this is normal. However, if you want, you can build up to the 4 tablets per day starting with 1 tablet twice per day for a week, then moving to 4 tablets.” 
ViSalus state that their mission is “Taking the weight off the world one person at a time. 10 lbs. at a time.” They add, “With good nutrition as our foundation and a powerful social network as our mobilizer, we’re committed to working together, as a company and a community, to provide a real solution to the global obesity epidemic.” 
Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation investigated ViSalus and their business model, concluding that there was a high probability that investors will lose their money in the distributer scheme. Vi-Slim Metab Awake Concerns: Conflicting information about returns policy Expensive supplement! Multi-level marketing company No individual ingredient quantities provided 
At the time of writing, there were large sections of the ViSalus website (visalus.com and vi.com) that were not working, either leading to an error notice, or redirecting to a completely unrelated website’s error page. What Does Vi-Slim Metab Awake Claim To Do? 
The manufacturers of Vi-Slim Metab Awake describe their supplement and its supposed benefits as follows: 
Help boost your metabolism with Vi-Slim. Our proprietary formula was designed to aid your body in metabolizing fats and carbs. Combined with a healthy diet and exercise, Vi-Slim helps support the body’s fat-burning process and may help promote lean muscle mass with no added caffeine. 
Vi-Slim is a blend of herbs, some of which have been used for thousands of years, as well as Chromium and Cocoa extract—all of this in one tablet (taken once a day) to help support metabolism, and help maintain healthy blood sugar levels already within normal range. Does Vi-Slim Metab Awake Work? 
There is clinical evidence to support the use of yerba mate and green tea to boost calorie burn (through both an increased metabolic rate and increased thermogenesis) and to aid with a small increase in the consumer’s rate of weight loss. 
However, Evodia reduces the effectiveness of caffeine; whilst this lowers the chances of side effects from the caffeine content, it also reduces the effectiveness of the product. The manufacturers also fail to state how much caffeine can be found in each tablet of Vi-Slim Metab Awake. 
Overall, we believe that Vi-Slim Metab Awake is a mild weight loss aid at best; its effects would be completely and easily counteracted by overeating. What Are The Ingredients of Vi-Slim Metab Awake? 
The ingredients found in Vi-Slim Metab Awake are detailed below. No individual ingredient quantities are provided as the product consists of a proprietary formula. Each capsules contains 450 mg of the proprietary formula. 
Herbal Blend 450 mg Cocoa Extract (Theobroma Cacao) (Fruit): Theobroma Cacao contains a mild stimulant called Theobromine. Theobromine is thought to be a much milder stimulant than caffeine, and is unlikely to have any significant impact upon weight loss. Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theobromine Green Tea Extract (Camellia Sinensis) (Leaf): Green tea is high in a group of antioxidants called catechins, as well as being a natural source of caffeine. Studies have suggested that catechins increase thermogenesis in the body, whilst caffeine increases energy expenditure by boosting the metabolism slightly for few hours. Source: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/70/6/1040.full Coleus Extract (Coleus Forskohlii) (Leaf): A plant belonging to the mint family that is thought to boost the metabolism. However, the clinical trials performed using this ingredient have shown no weight loss, even when the participants’ lean muscle mass increased and fat mass decreased. Source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2129145/ Yerba Mate Extract (Ilex Paraguariensis) (Leaf): There is diverse clinical evidence to support the use of this plant for weight loss, as it stimulates the central nervous system and increases the metabolic rate. It is also a source of caffeine, and so should increase energy levels. Read our full investigation for more information. Source: http://www.dietpillswatchdog.com/does-yerba-mate-work-yes-it-does/ Evodiamine Extract (Evodia Fructus) (Fruit): Evodiamine is extracted from a plant called Evodia. Evodia is thought by some to be a thermogenic weight loss aid. Clinical evidence is sparse, and no research has been conducted in humans. Studies in rats also show that it reduces the effectiveness of caffeine, and causes caffeine to break down much quicker. Does Vi-Slim Metab Awake Have Any Side Effects? 
There are several ingredients found in Vi-Slim Metab Awake that could cause a range of side effects. 
Green Tea and Yerba Mate are both sources of naturally occurring caffeine, but the amount of caffeine found in each tablet of Vi-Slim Metab Awake is not revealed by the manufacturer. Side effects associated with caffeine include headaches, increased urination, jitteriness, dehydration, increased blood pressure, heart palpitations and problems sleeping. Green tea can also cause constipation. 
Theobroma Cacao is similar in structure to caffeine, but is not as strong; it might cause similar side effects to caffeine. 
Evodiamine is under-researched, but appears to slow down blood clotting, and so should not be taken in the two weeks before surgery, or whilst recovering from surgery. As it also appears to cause caffeine to break down in the body faster, it could shorten the period of time that caffeine is effective in the body, and help to minimize the effects of caffeine (especially interrupted sleep patterns from taking it too late at night). 
Caution: Not suitable for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Not suitable for anyone under the age of 18. Stop taking this supplement at least two weeks before any scheduled surgery. Not suitable for anyone who is sensitive to caffeine and other stimulant ingredients. Not suitable for anyone with cardiac-related health issues, including but not limited to high blood pressure. Are There Any Customer Reviews For Vi-Slim Metab Awake? 
There are numerous customer reviews for this product on Amazon, where the product is sold. Customer reviews are mixed, but well over half of the reviews are positive. Two different reviewers claimed that they received bottles that only contained 15/16 capsules instead of the 30 advertised. 
I have tried so many pills before to help with my appetite and metabolism and I have to say that this product is amazing. One it’s affordable. Two there is no jitters or side effects. Three it curves your cravings and when you do eat you get full quicker! Four you only have to take it once a day. I would definitely recommend this product to someone who suffers from consuming a lot of food daily and has a slow metabolism. 
It was okay?? The weight didn’t fall off, and I exercised for two weeks in the morning after taking this. I combined it with the vi-shape and saw little to no results. Maybe a pound or two, but nothing like what the reviews had said. Maybe a stricter diet plan would work, but this didn’t do anything and I only have a few pills left. 
I could tell no difference. No added energy. No weight loss. I even bought another bottle thinking that maybe I just needed to give it more time. I’m half way finished with the second bottle and still have seen no results. 
The product is a total waste of money. Fat burner what a joke. The only way to lose weight is to step back from the table, watch your calorie intake and exercise. I repeat exercise There are no quick fixes. 
Saw no change in energy or metabolism. As far as I’m concerned, it was money wasted. Will not purchase it again. 
This is great and works well with the shake. Lost weight, nails are hard and strong. Losing and feeling fabulous. Does Vi-Slim Metab Awake Offer a Money-Back Guarantee? 
Although ViSalus claim to offer a 90 day money back guarantee, their terms and conditions suggest that Vi-Slim Metab Awake is not covered by this guarantee. Instead, orders made through ViSalus distributers are covered by the returns policy below:

Baker, dealt another blow Saturday, April 15, 2017, to Arkansas' unprecedented plan to execute eight inmates in an 11-day period, saying the men have the right to challenge a drug protocol that could expose them to ""severe pain."" (Dixie Knight Photography/U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas via AP) By: Staff The Associated Press Published on LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Arkansas inmates who had been set for execution in a series of double executions this month said Sunday that a federal appeals court should take up their claim that the compressed timetable would violate ""evolving standards of decency."" U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker granted the inmates stays of execution on Saturday, but she rejected their arguments that too little time between executions violated their constitutional rights. Arkansas originally planned to execute eight inmates between Monday and April 27. Lawyers for the state appealed immediately with the hope of beginning the executions Monday. In its filing Sunday, the inmates' legal team said the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should review Baker's decision to reject part of their arguments. The lawyers said it was wrong that Baker to say that the inmates ""did not establish a significant possibility of success on the merits on their claim that the compressed execution schedule is contrary to the evolving standards of decency."" Baker had said that while the Supreme Court has made reference to evolving standards, particularly when ""punishments are so disproportionate as to be cruel and unusual,"" the Arkansas death row inmates were unlikely to prevail. The attorney general's office says it will respond to the filing after full arguments are put before the appeals court. A different federal judge has issued a stay for one of the eight condemned prisoners and the state Supreme Court has issued one for another inmate. The six remaining executions are on hold because of Baker's order and because a state circuit judge in Little Rock ordered the state to not use a lethal injection drug until questions are settled on how the state obtained it. That judge, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen, has come under fire for taking part in anti-death penalty protests the same day after issuing his order stopping the use of the drug. Arkansas has asked that the state Supreme Court to reverse its decision halting the execution of Bruce Earl Ward, which was set for Monday. If it fails there, it can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The state is also seeking to overturn Griffen's order regarding the state's supply of vecuronium bromide. The 8th Circuit could take up the appeal of Baker's order at any time. Any decision there would likely also be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Editors' Picks ",Arkansas inmates ask appeals court to review part of ruling,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iukx.1bvM7k3sm_pKFn98RozwXUxnNgOidMGd916cRzbM352SPVlQzhC_aQSRjFQdYHxIcuvnHKZzI71mzS6XB4bxg.YRQ57t_ZT1oSXDhAd_VuM0iZse0VsEZZSMCsBPN4FVP6hEjQ--,da94dca7633d3a884c2c256a862edb7d83243362,www.metronews.ca,http://www.metronews.ca/etc/designs/thestar/images/apple-touch.png,http://www.metronews.ca/feeds.articles.news.rss,METRO NEWS | NEWS,CA,37932.0,0,metronews.ca,1,Arkansas inmates ask appeals court to review part of ruling,0.0,news,0,"[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'kristine baker'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'baker'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'arkansas'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'little rock'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'u.s.'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ark.'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': '8th u.s. circuit court of appeals'}]"

It needed to happen. Individuals need to spend lavishly on autos, yet adore SUVs. Along these lines, there was just arrangement: make a super-extravagance SUV. Furthermore, the times of super-extravagance abundance have arrived. 

Super-extravagance SUVs aren't another idea, let's be realistic. The Range Rover has been around for some time, and, up to this point, was the main genuine extravagance SUV on offer. Be that as it may, something went and changed. All-wheel drive came to vehicles, individuals needed SUVs to feel like autos and hybrids were conceived. At that point, they needed them to look like games autos, and games movement cars arrived. As a matter of fact extremely novel, their styling was not to everybody's taste, but rather there was a market regardless. The worldwide SUV showcase has developed by as much as 300 for every penny over the previous decade, and producers rushed to take a note of this pattern. 

Presently, however, the playing field has been hoisted. Bentley declared substantially before that super extravagance require not be limited to a particular frame, and as of late exhibited the Bentayga. Lamborghini have given the Urus the approval. Rolls-Royce, even, have tossed their cap into the ring. Mercedes-Benz declared their new GLS-Class, which essentially joins the GL-Class and S-Class offerings. Furthermore, at long last, where everything started, Land Rover have (as of now started offering) the long-wheelbase Range Rover, taking skilled extravagance significantly further. 

Presently, on the off chance that you've been in the Range Rover, driven it on and off the street, you'd know how mind boggling an auto it truly is. Under all that costly cover up and wood, lie advances so propelled, they've some way or another figured out how to limit them from view by concealing them in smaller scale chips controlled by a rotor or a handle. That is the thing that TerrainResponse2 resembles. It's mind blowing. To have the capacity to change the entire character of the auto with the turn of a dial. That is all fine when you take a gander at the standard auto, which, again is as yet monstrous and weighs more than two tons. Yet, now, they have the Range Rover L, and it's similarly as proficient. More than 300 mm of ground leeway, rough terrain capacity, review scaling like you wouldn't accept, and, to finish everything off, business-class seating in the back, cosseted away in the embodiment of extravagance. All things considered, nearly, some would state. Despite everything we need to perceive what the Bentley Bentayga resembles.  

Bentley have made a creature. That it wears a tie and has faultlessly sparkled shoes in any case, it will at present hit the ton in 4.1 seconds and do 301 km/h – making it the quickest SUV on Earth. How can it do that? The new motor – dedicated the W12 TSI – is the 6.0-liter unit with 608 PS and 900 Nm of torque. That is a considerable measure. What's more, the most amusing piece, and I'm not chuckling, is that the 900 Nm of torque crests from 1,250 RPM and keeps going an entire 3,250 RPM until 4,500 RPM. On the off chance that that is not a level and fat torque ""bend"" I don't comprehend what is. The Bentayga will likewise offer an unfathomable cluster of personalisation choices, incorporating a Breitling worked in self-winding clock that expenses nearly as much as the auto, and in addition a discretionary premium Naim for Bentley sound framework which again doesn't need to be talked about as far as cost in case you're a potential Bentayga client. At £160,000 something like that in the UK (Rs 1.6 crore before obligations and assessments) we're taking a gander at Rs 3.5 crore in addition to impose or something like that, without choices. Calculate those, and you'll see why it's being contrasted with the Rolls-Royce offering also. 

Very little is thought about the by and by codenamed ""Cullinan"" SUV aside from that it will go at a bargain in 2018 and presumably have a developed rendition of the twin-turbo V12 in the Wraith, and destined to be propelled Dawn. With 632-PS or something like that, it will offer all that anyone could need power and torque for its normal size – envision a Phantom home on stilts. It will, in all likelihood, turn into the lead, the most progressive and loved model to tolerate the Spirit of Ecstasy. Passing by the present swapping scale, don't hope to pay anything not as much as Rs 6 crore for the Rolls-Royce super-extravagance 4×4 when it arrives.

I wanted a dream with Asian flair. Thai had caught my eye and I wanted to see what she was all about. Great reviews on the oThER site so I figured she must be worth a visit.
On a side note, I had already tried to set up an appointment with Thai on two previous occasions as she comes here often. On both of those other occasions we set up a meeting time and she totally blew me off. Both times she went radio silent after I drove 30 plus minutes to get near her location. Not cool! She has great reviews so what's the deal? I mean come on girl. 3 strikes and you're out!
Man would I like to say it worked out on this third try but I whiffed (again). I normally won't stand for someone who is so rude they won't even text you back to let you know what's going on but the little head got the best of me. I'm done with her though! She sets a time tells you a near location then doesn't get back in a timely manner. She texted me over an hour after I left and said ""hey"". Then wouldn't respond when I asked what happened to our appointment? Beyond rude!
So after being stood up by Thai yet again, Kai, the Hawaiian was next on my list.
A quick text and she was ready to meet. Very professional. Only wanted a pic of me before meeting. We then set a time and she gave me the location. I dreamed of this really hot Hawaiian / Asian mix who was sexy as hell. Got to a decent hotel in S-Ville. She left the door open and in I went. Was not disappointed in the looks dept. She has a great figure and big boobs which I love! After a quick getting to know one another we undressed and the fun began.
Everything was covered but her oral skills are amazing. She almost got me off there but I held on for a good cowboy ride and mish. She was open to doggy and just about everything else I suggested. Totally into the session, nice moaning and pleasure for both of us. I definitely came hard. Well worth the price of admission and will repeat again before she leaves this week. I would rate the session an 8/10. Not sure if she does GFE and that would have increased the score but if you like hot women with some flavor she will satisfy the craving. I'm glad I went and will be back! Treat her well and you will be rewarded.",,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg94_2GKak84QkpDC4yla9UYpdkVq7o6.8MyAmiqCxQirpW02n5ZUm3v7gwoMwnJ8K_uKGQOdF7NepY5RNPcQLyT,4d1c36426f5c6412f0bbda6b94db758dfea402b8,www.usasexguide.info,,http://www.USASexGuide.info/forum/,USA Sex Guide ,DE,45757.0,0,usasexguide.info,7,BackPage Advertiser Reviews,0.0,discussions,8,[],[],[]

I'd seen the posts from senior members talking about her being pushy, rude etc. But given the overwhelmingly positive reviews on the other site and the fact that her body is incredible I couldn't resist.
She was responsive over text and showed up right on time. She seemed friendly enough on arrival, had a little chit chat but when she politely declined a drink I figured I'd assume the clock is ticking so I initiated the business. All downhill from there. Her body is definitely awesome but it just doesn't make up for the lackluster performance. CBJ was ok, but just ok. I have no idea who is writing the reviews that say she gives hall of fame head. I felt a lot of teeth and it was pretty mechanical.
I asked her to get on top which she clearly wasn't happy about, saying ""I'm not good at it"" but she obliged. Maybe 2 minutes passed and she demanded we do something else. She hopped up on my bed and started shaking her ass, telling me to pound her hard blah blah blah like she's some kind of nympho. That got me momentarily excited but I quickly realized it was just talk. After like 10 minutes she says she can't take any more and goes ""you've got to cum,"" and said no when I asked about a round 2. I told her she's not keeping the donation for a full hour in that case, and she said it was fine to adjust it to the 30 minute amount. We weren't even near 30, so we continued for a little but after her complaining about touching the V during mish and refusing to do lazy dog, I just finished in doggy after maybe 20 minutes. So basically I got a QV for $. 75. Not exactly a bargain. I'm still in my twenties so I don't doubt that I've got more energy than many hobbyists, but I pretty much always do a full hour and have never had a provider demand I stop early before. Plus I was actually taking it easy on her, specifically because I'd read the feedback from seniors here and wanted to take extra care not to piss her off.
She wasn't overtly rude, but definitely pushy and demanding. I'd say it was false sincerity. She clearly thinks very highly of herself. I can see her being the woman in the restaurant berating her waiter for allowing her water glass to fall below half full, or screaming in to her cell phone on a crowded airplane.
I have no idea how she has so many good reviews out there. Her average rating on the other site is like the same as Nellie's if not better...what planet are we on again?

First up I want to wish you all a very Happy Easter full of eggs, and books of course! 
We’ve just said goodbye to a family with a delightful couple of young boys who have kindly left me their shell collection in the bathroom after we spent a wonderful few hours on the beach – there really is nothing quite like seeing our island through a child’s eyes! This Week on the Blog 
My week started with my review for The Restless Dead by Simon Beckett , a very well told crime thriller set on the marshes in Essex. 
On Tuesday I hosted a post by Simon Beckett as part of The Restless Dead Blog Tour where he describes how he developed book one, The Chemistry of Death into a series. 
My This Week in Books featured books by Sarah R Shaber , Emma Kavanagh and Emma Flint – you’ll have to wait to hear what I made of this selection! 
On Thursday I posted my review of A Time For Silence by Thorne Moore which I actually read a while ago and it is definitely one of those books that linger in your mind. 
Next up was my review of The Conversations We Never Had by Jeffrey H Konis which he was kind enough to leave a comment on explaining why the imagined conversations were conducted in the formal manner presented. 
Yesterday was another post on the Put A Book On The Map feature, this time superbly executed by Booker Talk and Thorne Moore as they put A Time For Silence firmly on the map for Wales. This Time Last Year… 
I was reading Tammy Cohen’s When She Was Bad a brilliant psychological thriller set in an office which was scarily accurate. Even more scary was the Team Building exercise that the staff were forced to take part in – the very words send shudders down my spine!!

I have had some great luck in securing new books over the last couple of weeks so here’s a selection of my favourites 
Firstly from NetGalley I have a copy of The Fact of a Body by Alexandria Marzano-Lesnevich a non-fiction true crime read with a difference, which will be published on 18 May 2017 by Pan Macmillan. 
Blurb 
Before Alexandria Marzano-Lesnevich begins a summer job at a law firm in Louisiana, working on the retrial defence of death-row convicted murderer and child molester, Ricky Langley, she thinks her position is clear. The child of two lawyers, she is staunchly anti death penalty. But the moment Ricky’s face flashes on the screen as she reviews old tapes, the moment she hears him speak of his crimes, she is overcome with the feeling of wanting him to die. 
Shocked by her reaction, she digs deeper and deeper into the case, realizing that despite their vastly different circumstances, something in his story is unsettlingly, uncannily familiar. Crime, even the darkest and most unspeakable acts, can happen to any one of us, and as Alexandria pores over the facts of the murder, she finds herself thrust into the complicated narrative of Ricky’s childhood. And by examining minute details of Ricky’s case, she is forced to face her own story, to unearth long-buried family secrets, to reckon with how her own past colours her view of his crime. 
As enthralling as true-crime classics such as In Cold Blood and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and broadcast phenomena such as Making a Murderer and Serial, The Fact of a Body is a groundbreaking, heart-stopping investigation into how the law is personal, composed of individual stories and proof that arriving at the truth is more complicated, and powerful, than we could ever imagine. NetGalley 
I was lucky enough to be approved for a copy of Lisa Jewell’s Then She Was Gone , I’m a huge fan of this author and this, her latest book, will be published on 27 July 2017 
Blurb 
A BURIED SECRET 
THEN She was fifteen, her mother’s golden girl. She had her whole life ahead of her. And then, in the blink of an eye, Ellie was gone. NOW It’s been ten years since Ellie disappeared, but Laurel has never given up hope of finding her daughter. And then one day a charming and charismatic stranger called Floyd walks into a café and sweeps Laurel off her feet. Before too long she’s staying the night at this house and being introduced to his nine year old daughter. Poppy is precocious and pretty – and meeting her completely takes Laurel’s breath away. Because Poppy is the spitting image of Ellie when she was that age. And now all those unanswered questions that have haunted Laurel come flooding back. What happened to Ellie? Where did she go? Who still has secrets to hide? NetGalley 
Added to which another favorite author, Mark Billingham , is waiting publication of Love Like Blood in June 2017. 
Blurb 
DI Nicola Tanner needs Tom Thorne’s help. Her partner, Susan, has been brutally murdered and Tanner is convinced that it was a case of mistaken identity—that she was the real target. The murderer’s motive might have something to do with Tanner’s recent work on a string of cold-case honor killings she believes to be related. Tanner is now on compassionate leave but insists on pursuing the case off the books and knows Thorne is just the man to jump into the fire with her. He agrees but quickly finds that working in such controversial territory is dangerous in more ways than one. And when a young couple goes missing, they have a chance to investigate a case that is anything but cold. NetGalley 
I also have a copy of The Other Us by Fiona Harper which will be published on 4 May 2017 which is billed as one for those who loved The Versions of Us , which I did! 
Blurb 
If you could turn back time, would you choose a different life? Forty-something Maggie is facing some hard truths. Her only child has flown the nest for university and, without her daughter in the house, she’s realising her life, and her marriage to Dan, is more than a little stale. When she spots an announcement on Facebook about a uni reunion, she can’t help wondering what happened to Jude Hanson. The same night Dan proposed, Jude asked Maggie to run away with him, and she starts to wonder how different her life might have been if she’d broken Dan’s heart and taken Jude up on his offer. Wondering turns into fantasising, and then one morning fantasising turns into reality. Maggie wakes up and discovers she’s back in 1992 and twenty-one again. Is she brave enough to choose the future she really wants, and if she is, will the grass be any greener on the other side of the fence? Two men. Two very different possible futures. But is there only once chance at happiness? Amazon

After decades of unfulfilled promises artificial intelligence (AI) has started to deliver. Not hindered by rules and regulations intelligent machines are now exceeding humans in areas such as image recognition. With some of us this raises worries about killer robots. Consciously or subconsciously the tech industry is feeding these apocalyptic visions in order to divert attention from real issues surrounding AI. 
Prominent science and technology luminaries such as Bill Gates and Elon Musk have warned several times that self-aware, super intelligent artificial systems will advance to a point at which they could become a threat to human existence. Musk and Gates are closely linked to some of the largest players in the field of artificial intelligence. 
In recent years not a single large developer of artificial intelligence has gone to any length to debunk this kind of apocalyptic prophecy on AI. Meanwhile some technology leaders have gone as far as to predict precisely when technological singularity with all of its sci-fi horror will occur. And just to be sure Google has called for a big red button if all goes wrong with artificial intelligence. 
These types of visions are diverting attention from the large impact artificial intelligence already has on society, both positive and negative. AI is making stock market investment decisions, guiding healthcare treatments, deciding on who gets a loan or not and it is flagging which employees are underperforming. 
Rules and regulations highly needed With machine intelligence developing at an ever increasing pace it is clear rules and regulations in order to secure human welfare are highly needed. The industry lobby for the technology sector in the United States, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), is aware of this need: “With appropriate policies in place, robots should become our “best friends,” not our “worst nightmare,” experts said at its Forum in April last year. 
Despite this awareness it is no surprise technology companies are weary of policies and regulations as this tends to affect their businesses and profitability. What is more worrying though is that prominent AI players have united in Partnership on AI , an NGO-type of organisation to build trust in AI and to convince the world they are developing machine intelligence in a responsible way. 
Governments and regulators should wonder why Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google/DeepMind, IBM and Microsoft have set up this partnership to “provide guidance on emerging issues related to the impact of AI on society” while these companies themselves are the main drivers of this technology, and therefore are best suited to safeguard ethical development of this technology. 
Instead of merely providing guidance, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google/DeepMind, IBM and Microsoft could work to draft intelligent rules and regulations which leave ample room for the further development of AI while at the same timing making sure this technology will serve humans in their needs. 
Keeping ethical AI promises For a start it would help if these companies would keep their past promises on the subject of ethics. Unfortunately up to date Google has failed to keep promises in this field. The technology company agreed to set up an ethics and safety board when it acquired AI company DeepMind three years ago. The board was to ensure the technology would not be abused. 
One of the acquisition’s conditions set by DeepMind’s founders was that Google would create an AI ethics board. As part of the acquisition deal the founders also stipulated that “no technology coming out of DeepMind will be used for military or intelligence purposes.” 
In recent years DeepMind has publicly confirmed setting up the ethics and safety board. Still Google and its subsidiary refuse to detail who is on the board. British newspaper the Guardian has reported it “has asked DeepMind and Google multiple times since the acquisition on 26 January 2014 for transparency around the board”. 
January last year the paper received its only answer by DeepMind: “There hasn’t really been anything major yet that would warrant announcing in any way. But in the future we may well talk about those things more publicly,” the Guardian quotes DeepMind chief executive Demis Hassabis as saying. 
A call for regulations While business decision makers are calling for stringent ethical standards for AI, experts are calling for regulations. The necessity is for instance identified in a recent survey held by the Pew Research Center and Elon University which involved 1,302 technology experts, scholars, corporate practitioners and government leaders. 
The study quotes technologist Anil Dash saying: “The best parts of algorithmic influence will make life better for many people, but the worst excesses will truly harm the most marginalised in unpredictable ways. We’ll need both industry reform within the technology companies creating these systems and far more savvy regulatory regimes to handle the complex challenges that arise.” 
Henning Schulzrinne, Internet Hall of Fame member and professor at Columbia University, in the study notes: “We already have had early indicators of the difficulties with algorithmic decision-making, namely credit scores. Their computation is opaque and they were then used for all kinds of purposes far removed from making loans, such as employment decisions or segmenting customers for different treatment.” 
He continues: these kinds of credit scores “leak lots of private information and are disclosed, by intent or negligence, to entities that do not act in the best interest of the consumer. Correcting data is difficult and time-consuming, and thus unlikely to be available to individuals with limited resources. It is unclear how the proposed algorithms address these well-known problems, given that they are often subject to no regulations whatsoever.” 
FDA for Algorithms In the study researcher Andrew Tutt calls for an “ FDA for Algorithms ” noting “the rise of increasingly complex algorithms calls for critical thought about how to best prevent, deter and compensate for the harms that they cause. . . Algorithmic regulation will require federal uniformity, expert judgment, political independence and pre-market review to prevent – without stifling innovation – the introduction of unacceptably dangerous algorithms into the market.” 
Governments are there for wise to start regulatory initiatives on AI soon. In October, the US National Science and Technology Council released a report on Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence together with a National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan . Earlier this year the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament released a draft Report with recommendations to the Commission on Civil Law Rules on Robotics . 
With self-driving cars already taking to the road in most countries, progress on drafting actual regulations is sluggish. Late last year the science and technology committee of the British parliament stated that its government has been slow to recognise both the opportunities and threats posed by artificial intelligence. The UK should establish a commission on AI to provide global leadership on its social, legal and ethical implications, according to the committee . 
At this moment, the AI industry leaders’ Partnership on AI is turning out to be more of a marketing tool to convince people that artificial intelligence really will be human-friendly than a sound attempt to secure the right policies and regulations for AI are in place.

Jim O’Brien, 42 was baffled to receive the letter about a fine for parking on a double yellow line in December 2006 By Michael Doyle 15th April 2017, 7:00 am Updated: 16th April 2017, 3:10 am Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Comments A MAN has told of his shock at receiving a letter from cops saying they are going to court on his behalf to quash an 11-year-old parking fine. 
Jim O’Brien, 42, said he was baffled when it arrived yesterday. 2 Jim O’Brien holds up the parking fine 11 years later 
The letter told him police were appealing a fine for parking on a double yellow line on December 14, 2006. 
But Mr O’Brien, from Clondalkin, Dublin, said the most bizarre thing was he has no recollection of the “offence”. 
He told the Irish Sun: “I’m trying to contact them but no one’s picking up the phones and I got an automated response to my email saying someone would be in touch within three months.

“I don’t know whether I’m due a refund or what but I don’t remember this incident at all. If a number of parking fines were wrong I had no idea they went back so far with them — this was 2006. 
“The only thing I can think of was I used to work as a courier delivering medical products and such back then so maybe it has something to do with that.” 2 Jim O’Brien received the parking fine 11 years after the offence took place 
The letter says: “I’m writing to you following a review conducted by An Garda Siochana (Irish police force) of prosecutions taken in respect of Fixed Charge Offences. 
“It has been identified that the correct procedures were not followed by An Garda Siochana in respect of the court conviction imposed on you on 14/12/2006 in relation to Double Yellow Lines-Driver-Parking. 
“Subject to your consent, An Garda Siochana will commence a process of appealing the conviction on your behalf.” 
It asks the recipient to fill out an enclosed form and return it in a self-addressed envelope. It also apologises and says it will do everything possible to redress the issue as quickly as possible. 
A police spokesman said yesterday that if anyone has an issue with their fixed charge notices they should contact FCN.Helpline@garda.ie.

It was a bestseller. Back in 1848, the author dared not publish under her own name: Anne Brontë . A woman to write such a book? Inequalities between the sexes are at the heart of her story; not all have been left behind in the 19th century.
The tenant in question, recently arrived with her small son and female servant, is Helen, whose mysterious ways excite local gossip and religious opprobrium. Having fled a vicious marriage (its circumstances timelessly cruel), Helen is obliged to be secretive. If discovered, she will lose her son; male-oriented laws favour a husband, whatever the circumstances. Helen’s own moral convictions oblige her to discourage the love of local farmer, Gilbert, even though she reciprocates his feelings (Michael Peavoy ranges emotional scales of hope, jealousy, despair and resolution). They also compel her to return to nurse her injured husband (the tyrannical hell-fearing rake vividly played by Marc Small). Upright, determined, straight-spoken, strong without being aggressive or rude, religious but neither pompous nor pious, Helen’s complex character is magnificently distilled by Phoebe Pryce in a performance of clarity and understated power.
Deborah McAndrew’s astute adaptation maintains Brontë’s structure but alters events to dramatic effect, building on moments of discovery and decision that precipitate changes in the characters’ situations. We live their choices with them. The contrasts between temporal and eternal realities underpinning Brontë’s novel are conjured, in Amanda Stoodley’s design, by broken, dry-stone walls suggesting snug homes and wild moors, and in Ben Occhipinti’s soundscape, by cello notes bridging human tones and wuthering winds. Harmonising all these elements, Elizabeth Newman’s direction finely tunes Brontë’s past to our present.

Norman Lear is a living legend, a pioneering TV producer who rewrote the rules for network television with ground-breaking shows like “All in the Family,” “The Jeffersons,” “Maude,” “Sanford and Son” and “Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.” He then turned his attention to politics, founding “People for the American Way,” an influential progressive advocacy group defending foundational Constitutional rights including free speech, freedom of religion and equal protection under the law. Now he’s documented his fascinating 90+ years on earth in a new memoir titled “Even This I Get to Experience.” In this interview, Lear and The Young Turks’ Cenk Uygur discuss: - Why, even though he’s a standard-bearer for “liberal Hollywood, he considers himself “deeply conservative” - How a quarter flipped to him by an uncle changed the trajectory of his life - Why being a good liar got him fired from his first job as a press agent - Which are his favorite TV shows of all time (number three may surprise you!) - The experience in an airport terminal that made him realize that he’d finally “made it.” - Why Republicans today never talk about President Eisenhower Buy “Even This I Get to Experience” on Amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/Even-This-I-Get-Experience/dp/1594205728/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1432928743&sr=8-1&keywords=even+this+i+get+to+experience Like this interview enough that you want to thank us by throwing a little Bitcoin our way?

Over the Easter break, the small boy and I headed off to Blackpool for a couple of days of seaside fun. We had a bit of a check list of things we wanted to see and do while we were there, but mainly we wanted to have fun and chill out a bit. First on our holiday agenda was a trip to the Blackpool Tower Circus. 
I’d heard very good things about the Blackpool Tower Circus. Virtually everyone we told that we were planning a trip to Blackpool said that it was well worth seeing. I have very vague memories of going when I was a child, but that was about 800 years ago and things have probably changed since then. 
We had been told be friends to visit the Blackpool Tower early and pre-book our tickets. You can pay an extra £5.99 on top of your ticket to sit on one of the front few rows if you like. If you do this you get drinks and snacks included and a chance that some of the performers will chat to you. Sadly these tickets were fully booked, so we got a pair of tickets in the stalls instead. 
An adult ticket is £13 and a child is £10.50. We are Merlin Annual Pass holders, the ticket price is covered by our Merlin Passes, so we just showed our Merlin cards at the box office and we were issued our tickets. 
You’re advised to arrive a good half an hour before the show starts. Tickets are unreserved so you have to find your own seats. We sat around 5 rows from the front and we had a great view. If you’re in a large group you might struggle to find seats together, so do go early. 
Before the show and during the interval you can join the performers in the circus ring to buy lights and tricks, learn to spin plates or have your face painted like a clown (for a small additional cost). There is a bar at the back where you can buy drinks and snacks too. 
The Blackpool Tower Circus has been in residence in the Tower since 1894. We visited the circus on 5th April which was only the 5th day of their 2017 season. We felt pretty honoured to be seeing it all so early in the season. 
The approach down the winding corridors to the circus ring is filled with memorabilia and exhibits. We felt a bit pushed past it all by the crowds keen to get to their seats. This was a bit of a shame and I’d very much like to go another day and have the time to take it all in. 
The circus ring itself is in the round, meaning wherever you’re sitting you should get a good view. The current circus design was completed in 1900 and it is remarkable. It’s beautiful and baroque with padded velvet seats. There is room for several hundred people to enjoy the show but you still feel you’re close to the performers. 
Photography is not permitted once the show has started, so I wasn’t able to take any photos of the performance. However, the two hour long show, with additional interval was both breathtaking and hilarious. 
The glue which holds the show together are the clowns Mooky and Mr Boo. Mooky the Clown is the hilarious and cheeky funny guy which everyone loves and Mr Boo is his straight man. They’re brilliant and they were very much the highlight for my six year old. Mooky the Clown is a Blackpool Tower Circus legend and has been clowning around in Blackpool since 1992. 
The whole show was incredibly good. With acrobats, an amazing tightrope walker, trapeze artists, a fantastic live band and a troupe of beautiful dancers. There were several eye-watering acrobatic feats, my favourite being the neon clad trapeze artists and the Chinese tightrope walker. The circus is filled with amazing acts from all over the world and is genuinely incredible. 
The finale of the circus show is the dancing fountains. The circus ring is lowered and filled with water and beautiful acrobats twirl and swirl on a Roman themed carousel of sorts. It’s an awesome sight. The Blackpool Tower Circus is one of only four circus rings left in the world that can do this. 
We felt it was excellent value for money, especially with our Merlin Annual Passes. We would definitely consider the £5.99 VIP seating upgrade next time though. The circus itself was awe inspiring. The show is two hours long with an interval and it’s packed with fantastic performers and performances. The small boy is still raving about the clowns and I’m keen to go back and watch it all again. Always a good sign. For more information about The Blackpool Tower Circus and to book tickets visit the Blackpool Tower website . I’m a Merlin Annual Pass Blogger Ambassador.

It’s extraordinary, a completely uninhibited powerplay, which dominates the screen. But what’s remarkable, when you watch this BFI rerelease in honour of Nicholson’s 80th birthday, is the way Forman is able to balance this enormous, film-dominating turn, and draw our eyes to the supporting characters – to the scaly chill and stillness of Louise Fletcher’s glare as Nurse Ratched, to the immutable sadness of Will Sampson’s Chief. It’s not just Nicholson’s performance that makes this film a masterpiece; it’s the fact that Forman was able to prevent that performance from capsizing the whole enterprise.

This was how Beth Ditto used to disarmingly describe herself in her mid-00s heyday when, as lead singer of the band Gossip, she pushed herself, and her body, to the forefront of attention, appearing naked on the covers of NME and Love magazine to challenge the norms of what a woman should look like.
So powerful were those visual statements that, coupled with Ditto’s forays into fashion design, as well as the diminishing sales of the band’s records as they swerved away from blistering garage blues into sugary pop, they made it easy to forget that she was a singer of some talent.
With her first solo record, Fake Sugar , set to be released this summer, the 36-year-old’s intimate London gig is a reminder that it was her voice, rather than her body, that made her stand out. Addressing her absence, she declares: “Gossip is over. It was a good run, but we’re here, we’re queer, we’re weird, but my mother loves me.”
Crammed on a tiny stage with her four-piece band, the night feels more like a homecoming party than a showcase for her new material. Ditto has said this is her southern record, and opener Oh My God kicks in with a funk-rock beat as she channels the mid-80s power vocals of Bonnie Tyler, complete with a front-of-stage electric fan to give her the perfect windswept look. Her once angular bob grown out, she looks like a grunge version of Cleopatra-era Elizabeth Taylor, her gold lamé T-shirt dress embellished with a target in the centre.
But as the sound softens, it’s her voice and emotions that become the focus. On In and Out and Fake Sugar, she closes her eyes and draws out the tender trill in her voice, giving her the air of a heartbroken Nashville queen. And like Dolly Parton, Ditto alternates between infectiously warm, wisecracking comic and soul-baring torch singer. She seems to be on first-name terms with half of the adoring audience, who at one point demand that she sing some George Michael. Game as ever, off the cuff she delivers an a cappella snatch of Careless Whisper more moving than any of the tributes delivered at the Grammys or Brits.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the video for Beth Ditto’s new single Fire.
Dips into the Gossip back catalogue are judicious. The slashing guitars of Heavy Cross and high-energy electropop of Love Long Distance are a reminder of how electrifying they sounded in their pomp. After the latter, Ditto is gracious enough to admit: “I miss Gossip all the time. I’m not trying to steal these songs.”
Not that she has mellowed completely. As an encore, 2006’s Standing in the Way of Control feels even more like an anthem for smiling defiance, the crowd hollering back to Ditto the communal refrain, “I’m doing this for you”, with joyous abandon. “I was 23 when I wrote that song and I can’t believe it’s more relevant than ever,” she declares. “We got too comfortable. But I’m glad everyone’s awake now.”

Looks very good, might just wait and save!!
speed Click to expand... Hmm - I would probably go for a BK XXLS 400 over a PB -1000. I think the BK model will be comparable to the 10"" PB 1000 in terms of depth and better in terms of musicality.
Not too sure which PB 1000 review you have seen. However the SVS subs are very well regarded and they don't make a ""bad"" sub.
Thanks for the details about your setup. Seems good!
With regards to the WAF of both the BK & SVS models I would rate the BK models higher. The wood finishes can look really smart and the downward firing models don't even look too much like a speaker at all.
In fact this is where the BK Monolith's actually do a fairly good job of disguising themselves. They are so big if you add some nice cut (strengthened & edges rounded) glass to the top they can actually look like a nicely finished end table.
With regards to the Antimode I found a owners thread of sorts:

Inspired by Sarah Waters’s 2002 novel Fingersmith , The Handmaiden is a playfully provocative tale of seduction, desire and deceit. Slyly undermining stereotypes of fall guys and femmes fatales (this is more Bound than Basic Instinct ), Park’s film takes great delight in wrong-footing its audience, peeling away layers of mesmerising misdirection with delicious cinematic sleight of hand. As the serpentine narrative spirals back and forth upon itself, we witness the same events from multiple perspectives, each one more revealing than the last.
In Waters’s novel ( adapted as a BBC mini-series in 2005 ), an accomplished pickpocket is plucked from a Dickensian den to work in an upmarket home where she plays a key role in a scheme to separate a young heiress from her fortune. Park transfers the story from Victorian England to 1930s Korea under Japanese colonial rule. Here, Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri) is enlisted by elegant conman “Count” Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo) to serve at the home of Japanese heiress Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee).
Ridiculous male spectators are left frantically fanning their red faces and squirming awkwardly in their seats
Variously named “Tamako” and “Okju”, the mercurial Sook-hee must ensure that the naive Hideko falls in love with Fujiwara, enabling him to elope with her before swiftly committing the poor innocent to an asylum. His partner in crime will share the spoils, robbing Hideko’s Uncle Kouzuki of the handsome fortune he planned to inherit. Yet few of these characters are entirely what they seem, with role-playing, recitation, and unexpected reversals lurking at every corner, leaving us wondering just who exactly is “naive, and a bit foolish”.
The house in which this labyrinthine psychodrama plays out is a strange and mysterious hybrid, part western gothic mansion (there are shades of both The Haunting and Rebecca in its shadowy facade), part palatial Japanese residence. Within its lavishly sinister corridors we find rooms within rooms, spaces between the public and the private, the liminal and the subliminal. In one corridor, a symbolic snake stands guard, pointedly marking “the bounds of knowledge”. Down in the basement, something tentacular writhes, pulsating to the perverse rhythms of a library of Sadean pornographic writings. Meanwhile, out in the rolling grounds, the spectre of a dead aunt haunts the branches of the cherry trees, causing one inhabitant to wonder: “Did the big house make her go mad?”
After the Hitchcockian twists and skin-prickling Freudian symbolism of his first English-language feature Stoker , Park returns to the grand theatricality of his “Vengeance Trilogy” ( Sympathy for Mr Vengeance , Oldboy , Lady Vengeance ) with this fugue-like romp, which is by turns bitingly wry and pleasingly ribald. There’s a tactile fetishism to the ornate set designs, rich furnishings and lavish costumes (“all these buttons for my amusement”), while a profusion of shoes clutter the living space of a lady who, ironically, has nowhere to go.
Sarah Waters: ‘The Handmaiden turns pornography into a spectacle – but it's true to my novel' Read more
Cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon’s widescreen frame makes the most of this artefact-laden visual feast, while Cho Young-wuk’s score swoops and surges its way around the action, amplifying Park’s maximalist aesthetic.
While Abdellatif Kechiche’s Blue Is the Warmest Colour was criticised by source author Julie Maroh for its porn-inflected “display of so-called lesbian sex”, The Handmaiden has been enthusiastically embraced by Sarah Waters as a valid interpretation of the subversive sexuality of her novel. In a recent Guardian interview she praised Park’s film for remaining “very faithful to the idea that the women are appropriating a very male pornographic tradition to find their own way of exploring their desires” while simultaneously deconstructing those traditions. In one arrestingly weird scene, a theatrical reading from a work of allegedly erotic literature is illustrated with the aid of a giant marionette, providing an absurdist tableau which leaves its ridiculous male spectators frantically fanning their red faces and squirming awkwardly in their seats.
“Tell me, what is it that men want, at night?” Hideko asks innocently, a question to which The Handmaiden offers a piercingly satirical response. Just as the narrative plays with ideas of national colonialism, so the film’s female protagonists strive to find a space of their own, beyond the boundaries of stories told by men.
As for Park, he clearly relishes the opportunity to tie his audience up in knots, engaging them in a carefully choreographed game of cat-and-mouse, which his well-chosen cast play to a T. Despite the daunting running time, the film flies by in a breathless whirl of cinematic exuberance.

The Anglo-Australian quartet had been talking of a radical shift away from the commercial garage rock of their debut to more experimental, synth-based electronica.

North Korea attempted a missile launch Sunday morning local time (5:21pm ET), but it failed \""almost immediately\"" United States military officials confirmed to NBC News. South Korea\'s military detected the same results, according to South Korea\'s Yonhap news agency. The launch was attempted from Sinpo, a city on North Korea\'s east coast, some 400 miles from Japan, according to U.S. Pacific Command. Early assessments suggested the projectile was not an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental U.S., two U.S. military officials told NBC News. The attempted launch comes just one day after the North held a massive parade to display is military might, including what experts said included new capabilities for long-range ICBMs. \""U.S. Pacific Command is fully committed to working closely with our allies in the Republic of Korea and in Japan to maintain security,\"" the military said in a statement Saturday evening.

Incase you're new here or new to these posts.. I basically recap my training for the week, what runs, swims, cycles or whatever else I've been up to during the week.  Whilst I'm at it, Happy Easter! I hope you're enjoying the long weekend! :)

Anyway! If you wanna hear about how my training went this week, keep on reading!

MONDAY  - SWIM - 675m
I don't want to dwell on this one too much. I actually can't remember what happened in the lesson cause I was too focused on the jumping in that I mentioned last year. Long Story short, I didn't jump in again, I was feeling pretty upset post-swim. I'm over it now, Im taking a break from it and I'll revisit it another time.

TUESDAY  - RUN - 6.2 Miles
I didn't have a car on this day, Phillip had taken the car for the day. I'd gotten a lift into work and brought my running kit with me so I could run home from work. There's a lovely route all the way back to the house along the river and I havent done the route in quite a while.
Pace was pretty casual at 10:23min/mi - I stopped to take a couple of pictures along the river on the way home.

WEDNESDAY  - REST

THURSDAY  - REST - Unplanned - had a cinema date night on Weds and we got back really late. I slept in.. and wasn't feeling at all motivated to workout when I got home from work.

FRIDAY  - RUN - 4.22 Miles -  Ran with Phillips mum for the first time in ages! It was a pretty social run, we talked for the majority of the run.. ended up managing 9:41 min/mi with negative splits which was pretty great!
SATURDAY  - REST - Unplanned - Typically do parkrun or some sort of run on a Saturday - I had also planned on the first Open Water Swim of the season. Neither went to plan. parkrun in Cambridge is in the same location as OWS so during OWS season, we typically swim in the morning until 8:40-50 and then do parkrun straight after.

Unfortunately, Phillip and his mum bailed on me and they decided it was too cold. Much to my disappointment as it's not really worthwhile cost wise for me to travel there and swim by myself.. so I had to sit it out.

SUNDAY  - RUN 4 Miles - CYCLE 8.32 Miles -  Did 4 miles in the morning since I'd skipped my Sat run. Not much to really report.. It was mostly tracks with a mile off-road on a field which slowed my pace. Ended up with 10:18 min/mi.

In the afternoon, Phillip was watching Formula1. It's not my cup of tea so I took myself off for a quick cycle. It was actually pretty freezing, even with a long sleeved top on. I did get to try out my Quadlock Mount * that I got sent, which so far is great and SO convenient(review coming in the near future)!
On the way back from the cycle.. there were some utter douchebag motorists. Riding a bike around cars is SO scary.  You've absolutely no idea what a motorist is gonna do. Sadly, people are in too much of a rush these days and I've seen so many times on the road where people are too eager to just get past cyclists. I had a van who looked like he'd stopped on the road leading to the main road I was cycling on.. who then proceeded to pull out in front of me instead of waiting. Another car that overtook me and then signalled to turn into a road, cutting me off. Then a car coming out from the same turning tried to come out before waiting for me to pass the turning.

Unbelievable. I'll be taking my GoPro out with me on all rides as a sort of dashcam incase anything happened. A positive to the whole situation? I'm learning to use my cleats more and Im a lot more comfortable with them.

--

Not what I expected from training this week. Not as good as last week. I wanted to get in an exta swim which I was hoping to do with Open Water Swimming but no dice. Also could have gone cycling during the week.. but I've oddly not wanted to go out by myself until today.. so hopefully now I've done it I can go out again.

If I could at least keep to the 2, 2, 2 rule, I'll be happy!

In other exciting news. I officially signed up for Great North Swim for this year, so I'll be working on getting my mile swimming times down and trying to get in more front crawl instead of breast stroke during the open water swims.

Question: How are you spending the Long Easter Weekend? Do you cycle? If so do you find it scary cycling on the roads with cars? 
N.B * I was sent these items to review, but as always, all opinions are my own.

Hmm - I would probably go for a BK XXLS 400 over a PB -1000. I think the BK model will be comparable to the 10"" PB 1000 in terms of depth and better in terms of musicality.
Not too sure which PB 1000 review you have seen. However the SVS subs are very well regarded and they don't make a ""bad"" sub.
Thanks for the details about your setup. Seems good!
With regards to the WAF of both the BK & SVS models I would rate the BK models higher. The wood finishes can look really smart and the downward firing models don't even look too much like a speaker at all.
In fact this is where the BK Monolith's actually do a fairly good job of disguising themselves. They are so big if you add some nice cut (strengthened & edges rounded) glass to the top they can actually look like a nicely finished end table.
With regards to the Antimode I found a owners thread of sorts:
Views on Anti-Mode 8033 Part 2...
It's part 2 but you could go back and read part 1 as well if you have LOTS of time on your hands.
It may answer some of your queries about it though from ""consumers"". Click to expand... Agreeing here, XXL400 does look like a furniture in DF version. But 70/30 % movies i would go straight with Monolith (20£ price dif to XXL400). Sadly this is too big for Speed. For 470£ i don`t think anything can touch it on that price in HT performance. Quite funny when you look the prices of some speaker manufacturers subs, they ask even more and it would be whole different experience with Monolith. But compromises needs to be made in living rooms some times.
Having heard one of my friend PB1000 with Antimode i just got to say it offers lot of performance for the price. Room is rather small, but the trick here was finding the best spot for sub and then add Antimode, result was amazing. Such a tight quality bass and it pressuresed the room nicely when needed. When you hear this kind of setup and see people saying ""oh no that subwoofer is too big for the room"", it makes me laugh.. As AudioVisualOnline Dan said it`s all about setting it up correctly in room. More tweaking is probably needed, but the end result put`s smile on your face. Little off-topic, but my experience with SVS.
Sadly the prices did go up with SVS in UK, same as with XTZ. But PB1000 is still quite cheap @ 519£. Forum favourite XTZ 12.17 costing 599£. I think the idea with SVS has been the maximum HT performance with small amount of $. That doesn`t leave too much for the cosmetic side. It digs low, 18-177hz +-3db when measured, so about same as Monolith DF. The digital DSP amp seems to be great and SVS has the best warranty in the business. 5year for amp! There is so many reviews for PB1000, i don`t know which one Speed has read. But this has some CEA numbers to proof it really has great performance;
From a measurement standpoint, this is the most impressive <$500 sub I've encountered.
Review: SVS PB-1000 subwoofer Measurements
Anyway for basic living rooms with neighbours and nagging wife i can understand that P12/XXL400 offers enough performance for most people and great WAF. I think it depends how serious one is and when pushed something like Monolith/PB1000 can really make difference with movies.",,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPKrDerPFzZzKpf8ePCLI.28qIPSoe63_TuI6IWuN16cpFHODrXuZ9n9,7f10a55ecb5193a9b39db44107ae2238a96f5ec6,www.avforums.com,https://static.avforums.com/data/avatars/m/594/594351.jpg?1401737693,https://www.avforums.com/forums/subwoofers.127/,Subwoofers | AVForums,GB,10709.0,0,avforums.com,6,Question - Bk xxl400 or M plus | AVForums,0.0,discussions,6,[],[],[]

The hot Cavalier stood out from the ""repmobile"" crowd with its 204bhp C20LET turbocharged engine, four-wheel-drive and Chevrolet Corvette-derived six-speed gearbox when it made its debut in 1992, but with just 49 left registered on the UK’s roads according to howmanyleft.co.uk , it’s now one of the rarest and most cherished of 1990s performance saloons.


At least 10 of the surviving examples will be on display at the show, from immaculately preserved standard variants to the wildly modified.

The Cavalier feature will be just one part of the ultimate show for fans of hot Vauxhalls, sponsored by Apex Performance and Goodridge , which regularly attracts over 10,000 visitors to the famous drag strip.

With on-strip action, including the chance for owners to enter their own Vauxhalls in a VX-only ‘Run What Ya Brung’, Santa Pod will be spilling over with Griffin greats, be them retro Novas, Chevettes, Cavaliers and Astras, or more modern VX220s, Monaros and VXRs.

As well as the drag strip action, PVS promises a host of other features including an Autotest, entrance photography, a lively retail village for the latest parts, mods and memorabilia, a show and shine, and some of the best and busiest club displays going.  
The show itself takes place on the Sunday, but many fans making their annual pilgrimage love to make a weekend of it, so this year PVS is putting on some live evening entertainment, in the form of DJ Pied Piper and MC DT, the sound behind the famous Ayia Nappa hit ‘Do You Really Like it?” 
Camping is available at the show on the Saturday evening, and that’s where the fun really begins. Camping costs £25 per person if booked in advance, with a late night bar and Santa Pod’s funfair in action all evening.

An early bird offer also applies to show day tickets - £18 (plus booking fee), as opposed to £23 on the gate. To buy tickets, visit www.performancevauxhallshow.co.uk 

For the first time in 2017, there will be a second Performance Vauxhall Show later in the year, which takes place at Rockingham Motor Speedway, Northants, on October 15. A special double discount package is on offer for Vauxhall clubs that want to attend both.

0,Bernadette McNulty,2017-04-16T11:16:13.000+03:00,[],,,english,0,2017-04-16T11:16:13.000+03:00,,"T he worst thing a reviewer has said about Little Dragon is that they make the kind of music you hear in Urban Outfitters. The second worst thing is that they were the band that almost made it.
It’s true that the Swedish four-piece’s breakthrough album six years ago, Ritual Union , may have been the fashionable synthpop you’d hear while shopping for cut-off denims and retro cushions. It’s also true that the follow-up, 2014’s Nabuma Rubberband , while it was nominated for a Grammy and attracted polite critical applause and decent enough sales, was hardly their moment in the sun. And yet this fifth album, Season High , is so warm and dreamily upbeat that you might need to wear those denim cut-offs just to listen to it.
There was always a futuristic shimmer of perfection to Little Dragon’s sound, but in the past it was often dragged back by an undercurrent of unease, a shadowy dissatisfaction in their skittering, nervous rhythms and lead singer Yukimi Nagano’s mournfully soulful voice. Songs like Paris nagged at you like an itch. Shaped by their rainy home town, Gothenburg, Little Dragon seemed to be shade-dwelling plants compared to the assembly line of shiny, durable Volvo pop coming out of Stockholm and the school of Max Martin .
While they haven’t gone the full California Gurls Katy Perry, Season High is the sound of Little Dragon kicking back and enjoying themselves rather than struggling to be seen as serious musicians. After 20 years together, the band have wisely drafted in producers James Ford and Patrik Berger to adjudicate and eliminate their tendency to overthink things in the studio.
The sound of unashamed pleasure and escapism is sometimes startling. Nagano has never been afraid to play on the ninja-cartoon image of her Japanese heritage, a persona that proved the perfect fit for collaborations with Gorillaz, De La Soul and SBTRKT. Nonetheless, opener Celebrate and Should I are decked in the cheesiest oriental synth sounds you could find on a vintage Roland TR-808 drum machine, the kind prominently featured in their beloved early 80s Minneapolis sound of Prince and Jam and Lewis .
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vinyl Cut: Little Dragon go record shopping with the Guardian
The shoulder-padded, flat-top Afro vibe saturates the first half of the album; I almost expected Prince contemporary Alexander O’Neal to pop up, freshly oiled and besuited, on the languid, dope-haze ballad High , rolling another one, as Nagano requests. The beats toughen up with the second half bangers Strobe Light and Push, on an album that lyrically does what it says on the tin. Mind-altering substances aside, it’s the exquisite smoky intimacy of Nagano’s voice that stops the album from becoming a total sugar rush, especially on the childlike romanticism of Butterflies and Gravity.
The zeitgeist may have passed them by, but Little Dragon sound like they are having too much fun to care.

Subscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News Arkansas is one of the worst places to be a renter in America. It is the only state in the US where tenants are treated as criminals for paying rent late and landlords are not required by law to maintain their properties. Its failure-to-vacate law lets landlords give tenants a 10-day eviction notice if they are even one day overdue. Tenants who can\'t or won\'t leave within that span face fines for every day they remain on the property and up to 90 days in jail. This makes things difficult for the third of Arkansas\'s residents who are renters and have legitimate concerns about the properties they are occupying. The combination of failure-to-vacate and the lack of warranty of habitability make it almost impossible for tenants to challenge their landlords for legitimate reasons. It\'s estimated that criminal evictions occur everyday in Arkansas, resulting in over 2000 failure-to-vacate cases being filed each year. VICE News visited Arkansas to learn more about its draconian eviction laws. From the courthouses to the porches of some of the state\'s poorest residents, we documented first-hand accounts from one of the country\'s most underreported stories.

I managed to get a switch from Maplin and my mate who's an Electrician fitted it yesterday, it was a pig of a job to get the connectors to stick but eventually he got there.
It is connected on the +12db rca on the Strata, On the Audiolab 8200ap I set all the speakers to small, and individually set crossover of 10Hz above the bottom end of the speakers as read. Then as also advised on here changed between mode 2/4 on the Strata seeing which seemed best.Adjusting volume as I went. I might try the rca on the normal setting as the bass was strong, even when vocals had quietened off!
This arrangement worked very well, will only have to make a few adjustments here and there.On moderate volume my wife said a picture on the other side of the lounge wall was vibrating!!
I run the AP, through a Tag 100x5r, onto ATC 40,C3C centre and MA Silver FX surrounds.
Discussed with the wife about running 2 subs, not got much chance! Doesn't like any of the set up in the lounge!! Lol, so if I buy another will have to sell the Strata!
So doesn't want anything much bigger, maybe get away with a xxl400, but that's about the max in size.
@UEG has said about SVS, but the cost goes a little high and I can't really justify spending that much really
He also mentioned about using an anti mode, will have to read a bit more about their use.

The management team behind the Lytham Hall restoration scheme has publicly challenged a damning report on its efforts for the first time. 
Last year the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) announced it was rescinding a £1.7m grant towards the project after it emerged that the capital works for which the cash was earmarked had not taken place. 
The fall-out from the controversial move last month led to Fylde councillors calling for the removal of the boss of the management team, John Miller, chairman of Heritage Trust North West. 
Fylde Council, which had put £300,000 towards the project to restore the Grade I-listed mansion to its former glory, also imposed a list of conditions for its contributions to remain in place. 
But John Turner, trustee, of Heritage Trust North West and member of the Lytham Hall executive, stated that while the Trust accepted many of the HLF concerns raised in the consultant’s report and was seeking to remedy them, the Lottery body had misunderstood some key points and the report had been rushed. 
And he also called on all parties – including Fylde Council – to stop bickering and work together on the project. 
Mr Turner, said: “We have been constrained from speaking publicly about this before without written permission from (the consultants) Moore Stephen, who have just given us permission.” 
The report was written after the consultant visited the Trust, on behalf of the HLF, to carry out an external review of its “organisational and project finance”. 
Its contents led the HLF to rescind its grant, after criticisms around “project delivery”, “the accountant not being qualified” and a key figure’s “lack of involvement in decisions”. 
The Trust says a qualified accountant would cost up to £40,000 a year to employ but would “not guarantee there will be no errors”. 
The report states: “There have been a number of concerns surround the financial stability of the Trust including substantial current liabilities in excess of current assets, which suggested an immediate cash flow crisis.” Trending",Lottery fund report criticises Lytham Hall team,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_IEwR.uq8N9m16HxSobYoUog0.zP5zqbjdxXJmzAqGEiUflSE8L4288RHFogv7TBk7eVqRPTKBx8KlgyhicqvWYHAAmtlYu.rNIhtQDoLu1Uop976AMqTrCgNmvXy61UezX9iY_xB14xvaAD_YlBf6,ae17428bcb108b5fedf6a9bd7d9691a2d761871b,www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk,"http://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_300,f_auto,ar_3:2,c_fill/http://www.lythamstannesexpress.co.uk/webimage/1.8494105.1492177493!/image/image.jpg",http://www.lythamstannesexpress.co.uk/rss/cmlink/1.52747,Lytham St Annes Express WLSE.news.feed,GB,,0,blackpoolgazette.co.uk,0,Lottery fund report criticises Lytham Hall team,0.0,blogs,0,"[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'mr turner'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'john miller'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'john turner'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'moore stephen'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'lytham hall'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'lytham hall have'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'lytham hall'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'fylde council'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'heritage trust north west'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'heritage lottery fund'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'trust'}]"

We got it all,” they purr. “#hotstuff #werereadyforyou.”
Ready to both give you Damascene moments with charred meats and for you to hashtag your experience and induce other people to go there. And what’s wrong with that?
We use Instagram now to plan where we’re going to eat next and what we’re going to eat when we get there. There’s still cynicism about this, but it’s marketing gold dust. With such a shift in how we navigate our appetites, you wonder: would any chef admit to creating food specifically for Instagram?
Rankin wouldn’t. “Instagram is a great way of publicising your business, but I’ve never intentionally made food for it. Most of my food is pretty basic in terms of presentation. You’re probably doing something wrong if you’re relying on Instagram to fill your restaurant.” He’d prefer to attract attention with the “quality” of his flavours rather than the photogenic appeal of “some tarted up iconic dish that fails to deliver”.
Sunday roast with a smokey twist. Fantastic British meat, great drinks and service again @temperlondon #sundayroast #britishbeef #yorkshirepudding
A post shared by John Rowland (@rowland.jw) on Apr 2, 2017 at 6:59am PDT
James Lowe, head chef and owner of Lyle’s in east London – a restaurant known for its simple, elegant presentation – offers equally unminced words. “Do I create dishes specifically for Instagram? No. Am I aware of what people tend to ’gram? Yes. Do we use that knowledge to create something more ’grammable? No. I know places that have a great feed, but the food is rubbish. I call it ‘cooking for pictures’.”
Lowe stresses “the most important thing for any dish is how it tastes”, but in some cultures looks are incredibly important. Across the Far East, even the presentation of street food can be a high priority. The photogenic nature of something like bao – steamed buns found in many Chinese cuisines – is incidental. However, when the Taiwanese street-food outfit Bao found a bricks and mortar home in 2015, a permanent queue formed once people started ’gramming one dish: the fried chicken gua bao. Queues remain because people return for more.
Looks and taste colliding in this way was a happy accident for Bao’s owners, and other small businesses who have found Instagram success with one iconic product. The novelty factor could wear off quickly if the pleasure of eating doesn’t match the pleasure of looking. But sometimes Instagram fame is unpredictable. Sometimes the pleasure comes not from the beauty of a perfectly precise colour palette, but instead in seeing something so squidgy and bulbous it makes you laugh, like the doughnuts from Bread Ahead , a bakery stall in London’s Borough Market, which are now both the business’s main selling point and something for which people pilgrimage from afar, all due to Instagram.
'Do-Nut' say NO to that.
A post shared by MAO? (@teemaomao) on Jan 9, 2017 at 5:42am PST
What if you’re a food business and don’t want to wait for your happy accident, though? Can you get ’gram notoriety with a dish that prioritises beauty over taste?
It appears so. Last year, New Yorkers started ’gramming a see-through dessert that looked like a breast implant. The “raindrop cake”, created by Darren Wong and sold at the Smorgasburg food market in Brooklyn , prompted headlines such as “This Dessert Looks Just Like a Blob of Water and I Can’t Look Away”, but “tasteless” was a common review. At $8 (£6.90) it seemed, in more ways than one, a bit of a transparent gimmick. And now it’s coming to the UK.
Bangkok restaurateur Fah Sundravorakul is putting it on the menu at the London ramen pop-up Yamagoya next month. I was invited to try one. God, but it looks stunning – like some sort of deep sea creature; gently trembling beside crushed peanut powder and brown-sugar syrup. Piercing it feels monstrous. Taste wise, it’s… well, it’s sweet, cold gloop that liquefies in the warmth of your mouth – quite exciting, but only the subtlest of flavours come from the powder and syrup. It’s too weird to be a gustatory joy, but I immediately take a picture and wonder when I’ll be able to post it. Is this the point?
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jelly beautiful: the ‘raindrop cake’. Photograph: Pål Hansen for the Observer
Sundravorakul prefers to give some context on the dish first. “It’s not from Brooklyn,” he says. “It has been very popular in Japan for a few years.” The “cake” is a mizu shingen mochi , or water mochi – a jelly-like dish made from water sourced in the southern Japanese Alps, which Sundravorakul has shipped over. The Japanese “enjoy the cool texture” and the “challenge to your senses”. That it loses its agar-set form after 30 minutes makes it an ephemeral experience – much like Instagram. Sundravorakul won’t directly admit he’s bringing the dish here for ’gram potential, but will say: “We are aware of how powerful social media is.” We stare at the cake, now melting, for some time.
Lowe believes that creating a dish specifically for Instagram is “dishonest”. It’s hard to disagree. If you’re paying for something that looks magical but tastes like a trick, something is wrong. Or is it? Critics wonder what’s being lost as food becomes social currency for the digital age, but if it’s a luxury people can still afford, can we really make critical judgments about the ways in which it provides them with fleeting pleasures? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to choose which filter to use: Lark or Lo-Fi.

Yes it’s fast, fearsomely so on occasion especially mid-range, but the SQ7 can often feel too keen to leap up the road like an eager puppy constantly pulling at a lead. Thankfully, though, Bentley has been able to develop the engine individually for more refi nement to remove those issues, something that’s immediately obvious. 
Don’t get us wrong, this is still a very rapid car when you flex your right ankle, but at the same time, that overeagerness has been dialled out from the engine, instead just offering a solid and constant surge of power rather than anything too peaky and urgent. 
The result is progress that feels far more refined and far more, well, Bentley-like. Crucially too, while there’s a little diesel rattle when standing alongside the car outside, once you’re ensconced inside, there’s no hint of what’s under the bonnet and any passengers would certainly be none the wiser. 
There’s a lot to like about this diesel Bentayga. Yes the ride can be a little fidgety at times, but that’s to be expected for a car of this weight running on 21in wheels and tyres. 
However, the biggest compliment you can probably pay it is that it feels no different to the petrol model. Despite its size and dimensions, it feels like it shrinks around you when driving with enthusiasm, with plenty of grip and confidence to be had. Fair enough, very few owners are likely to drive their Bentaygas anywhere near its limitations (either on or off-road). 
But the reality is that it’s far more capable than many will ever imagine and it retains a noticeable degree of sportiness. In conjunction with the arrival of this diesel is also the option for a pair of small extra seats in the boot, although they will only ever be suitable for children. 
Yet Bentley still expects about 15 per cent of buyers to tick that box on both this diesel and the petrol. And then there’s also the unmistakable gorgeousness of the rest of the Bentley’s interior. 
It may not look or feel the most high-tech on the market, but the wood, leather and handcrafted detailing is exquisite. It is also quite satisfying that even tiny details such as the contrast colour stitching around the rim of the steering wheel has been finished by hand rather than a clever robot. PH The Bentayga diesel will cost drivers £135,800 
Some things are still best done the old-fashioned way and the expertise in every element is clear. Of course, that doesn’t come cheap. Despite a saving of £25,000 over the petrol-engined version, our particular Bentayga test car boasted an eye-watering £61,400 of options. 
Even that hand-stitching around the steering wheel we mentioned will set you back a further £165. On the first Bentaygas produced last year, Bentley estimated that the average spend on options would be between £50,000-£70,000 and that shows no signs of abating with this diesel either. 
Even the ultimate optional extra, the hand-made Breitling Tourbillon clock in the dashboard costing £150,000 is restricted by how many Breitling can build, rather than by how many people want them. 
That this new diesel version of the Bentayga will increase the car’s popularity worldwide is not in doubt. And whatever your current views on diesel cars, the fact is that for the Bentayga, the future of Bentley and all of those 4,000 workers in Crewe, that’s only good news.

Here, the action revs up with a car chase around the streets of Havana. One of the first Hollywood movies to shoot in Cuba, F&F8 effectively uses one of the most photogenic cities on Earth as a display cabinet for vintage hotrods and buttocks. The race is between a turbo-boosted Cuban loan shark and Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) in a disintegrating clown car. Powered by distilled testosterone alone, Dom wins the race, driving backwards, consumed in a fireball, without brakes. The writing is scorched into the tarmac: this episode is aiming for new levels of high-octane silliness.
There is no shortage of muscle battling for alpha-male supremacy. In Vin Diesel, Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson, the film has three of the shiniest, baldest, most artificially bronzed men in Hollywood. When they start to butt heads, it’s like watching a human conker game. Of the three, it’s Statham who swaggers away with the movie, thanks to an audacious fight sequence accessorised with a gurgling baby in a travel seat and a cameo from British grand dame Helen Mirren as his tea-swilling mum.
The baby is a key plot device. The child-menacing antagonist is super-hacker Cipher (Charlize Theron, kitted out with stringy blond dreadlocks, which are meant to suggest “cyberpunk princess of darkness” but look a bit too “gap yah in Goa” for comfort). Cipher is stockpiling WMDs, but since she has the power to hack into anything with a chip – including, obviously, most cars – it’s not entirely clear why she needs the weapons. A geeks-will-inherit-the-earth cyberpocalypse hardly requires a carjacked nuclear submarine to trigger panic. It just needs someone to turn off the internet for a while.
Ultimately, you would have more luck reassembling a working vehicle after Cipher’s remotely hacked zombie-car pile-up than you would piecing together a logical plot. But then logic is not really the strong point of a series that features Diesel walking unscathed and in slow-mo from a screaming pile of twisted metal at least five times per film.

Close What does the Uber tribunal ruling mean for the gig economy? Wochit 
Regulators in New York City are pursuing a rule that would require ride-hailing services such as Uber to offer an in-app tipping option. On Monday (17 April), New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) announced a proposal which would require car services that accept only credit cards to allow passengers to tip the driver using their card, the New York Times first reported. 
Unlike New York City's taxis and rival service Lyft, Uber does not offer tipping via credit cards. As per Uber's current policies, tipping is not included in the tip fare and is not ""expected or required."" 
""This rule proposal will be an important first step to improve earning potential in the for-hire vehicle industry, but it is just one piece of a more comprehensive effort to improve the economic well-being of drivers,"" New York City's taxi commissioner Meera Joshi said in a statement to NYT. 
The TLC's move stems from a petition from the Independent Drivers Guild, a union-backed association that advocates for over 45,000 for-hire vehicle drivers in New York. 
""Uber has been stubbornly unwilling to give our riders an easy option to tip,"" the petition reads. ""As a result, New York's working drivers are losing thousands of dollars we need for vehicle upkeep and supporting our families in one of the most expensive cities in America."" 
The petition, which has garnered over 11,000 signatures so far, argued that Uber makes the issue worse by telling riders that ""tips are not expected."" 
Uber said it looks forward to reviewing the tipping proposal. 
""Uber is always striving to offer the best earning opportunity for drivers and we are constantly working to improve the driver experience,"" Uber said in a statement to multiple media outlets. ""That's why, in New York City, we partnered with the Machinists Union to make sure current and future Uber NYC drivers have a stronger voice and launched a series of new tools and support policies for drivers."" 
The proposal is expected to be formally introduced by July followed by a public hearing. New York City officials are moving to require Uber to offer an in-app tipping option. Reuters 
IDG estimates that the rule, if passed, could mean an additional $300m (£238m) per year for ride-hail drivers in the city. 
""The exploitation of ride-hail drivers must end and this is an important first step,"" IDG founder Jim Conigliaro, Jr. said in a statement. ""Drivers have long been denied access to the kinds of benefits and labor protections many workers take for granted, such as paid sick leave or the minimum wage. 
""As a result, New York City's professional drivers have traditionally depended on gratuities for a substantial portion of their income. Cuts to driver pay across the ride-hail industry has made tipping income more important than ever."" 
The Guild first raised the issue to Uber in June last year after a survey of its membership cited tipping as a key issue. After Uber resisted, IDG launched a tipping campaign including an online petition and social media ads. 
Last month, Lyft said its drivers across the US earned over $200m (£159.08m) in tips since the feature was first introduced in 2012. 
In January, Uber agreed to pay $20m to settle allegations from the Federal Trade Commission that it misled drivers about potential earnings and vehicle financing. 
Uber has been hit with a series of damaging scandals since the beginning of the year including sexual harassment allegations, a lawsuit from Alphabet's Waymo and an embarrassing video that showed CEO Travis Kalanick berating an Uber driver over falling fares. 
Last month, top Uber executives pledged to improve relations with drivers whilst working to clean up its image and get the firm back on track.

Liverpool are monitoring Naby Keita, the RB Leipzig midfielder who has been a revelation in the Bundesliga this season. 
We recently spoke to Jörg Jakob, editor of Kicker, who is a big fan of the 22-year-old. 
“He is the rising star of the season,” Jörg said. “When we did our rankings after the first half of the season, he was one of the outstanding players for Kicker magazine.” 
Keita has most often been deployed as one of the defensive two in Red Bull Leipzig’s 4-2-2-2 formation, although he has also played further forward at times. He has grabbed eight goals and seven assists in 24 Bundesliga starts this season. 
Because of his stature, he has been compared to Chelsea’s N’Golo Kanté, but this comparison is misguided. 
The Guinean is more attack minded than Kante, and could be the perfect hybrid needed in Liverpool’s midfield. Read More The Liverpool review podcast - Paul Joyce on the tough battle the Reds face to sign summer targets 
Keita is supremely gifted with the ball at his feet, averaging a remarkable 2.9 completed dribbles per game this season. Comparing this to potential competitors for his position at Anfield, Jordan Henderson has 0.2, Emre Can 0.6 and Gini Wijnaldum 0.7. 
As well as his dribbling, Keita has proven he can break lines with his creative passing. While he completes less passes and a lower percentage of his passes than Henderson, Wijnaldum and Can, he makes more key passes than all three. 
He is a risk-taker, which has earned him seven assists this season. 
Keita has also scored an impressive range of goals this season, including a long range strike against Freiburg and a Messi-like run in the recent win over Mainz. 
On top of his contribution going forward, Keita’s defensive influence can not be underestimated. He has managed an impressive 2.6 interceptions per game in the league this season. Kanté has 2.2, while Henderson has 1.7. Read More Who is Naby Keita? 
His athleticism and speed allow him to cover a lot of ground, which would be a big addition to Jurgen Klopp’s pressing style. 
His strength and low centre of gravity make him nearly impossible to dispossess, which would aid the Reds in European competition, where many opposition teams will look to press the midfield. 
Keita would be a difficult signing to make due to interest from several of Europe’s top clubs, with Bayern Munich one such team touted. 
Difficult would become impossible without Champions League football, and any deal for the the player would likely be a costly one. 
Still, if Klopp could lure the African star to Anfield, he would bring a bit of everything to the Liverpool midfield.

NASA: Ingredients for Life at Saturn’s Moon Enceladus published: 13 Apr 2017 NASA: Ingredients for Life at Saturn’s Moon Enceladus NASA: Ingredients for Life at Saturn’s Moon Enceladus published: 13 Apr 2017 views: 826 
NASA\'s Cassini spacecraft discovered hydrogen in the plume of gas and icy particles spraying from Saturn\'s moon Enceladus. The discovery means the small, icy moon — which has a global ocean under its surface — has a source of chemical energy that could be useful for microbes, if any exist there. The finding also provides further evidence that warm, mineral-laden water is pouring into the ocean from vents in the seafloor. On Earth, such hydrothermal vents support thriving communities of life in complete isolation from sunlight. Enceladus now appears likely to have all three of the ingredients scientists think life needs: liquid water, a source of energy (like sunlight or chemical energy), and the right chemical ingredients (like carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen). Cassini is not able to detect life, and has found no evidence that Enceladus is inhabited. But if life is there, that means life is probably common throughout the cosmos; if life has not evolved there, it would suggest life is probably more complicated or unlikely than we have thought. Either way the implications are profound. Future missions to this icy moon may shed light on its habitability. White smoker footage courtesy of: NOAA-OER / C.German (WHOI)...

Our outcomes of interest were: 1) the BCD implantation rejection percentage, 2) reasons to reject BCD implantation, and 3) possible prognostic factors predicting the trial outcome. Data Extraction and Synthesis: At critical appraisal, six studies (n = 471 patients) scored a moderate to high directness of evidence and a medium or low risk of bias and were selected for data extraction.

Therefore, results of studies were summarized per outcome: 1) after the BCD trial, 32.0 to 69.6% of SSD patients rejected BCD implantation, 2) the three main reasons for rejection were experiencing limited benefit from the device, patients fearing or being unfit for surgery and cosmetic aspects, 3) no clear prognostic factors predicting the trial outcome could be identified.

It’s been a rough week for United Airlines. 
That deluge didn’t let up on Sunday, when KHOU reported that a couple had been kicked off their United flight as they were headed from Houston to Costa Rica for their wedding. 
Michael Hohl and Amber Maxwell had allegedly boarded their flight on Saturday and were about to take their seats when they said they saw a passenger napping across the row they were assigned to. 
Hohl said that instead of waking up the man who was sleeping, he and his fiancée decided to sit a few rows in front of their assigned seats. 
“We thought not a big deal, it’s not like we are trying to jump up into a first-class seat,” Hohl told KHOU, the CBS affiliate in Houston. “We were simply in an economy row a few rows above our economy seat.” 
Hohl said that after he and Maxwell sat down, a flight attendant asked if they were in their assigned seats. When the couple said no and explained why they had moved, Hohl said the attendant declined their request for an upgrade and asked them to return to their original seats. 
Hohl said that although he and Maxwell did as they were told, a US Marshall later boarded the flight and asked them to get off the plane. The couple said they complied with that demand as well, but found the overall experience “strange.” 
“They said that we were being disorderly and a hazard to the rest of the flight, to the safety of the other customers,” Hohl said. “I think customer service and the airlines has gone real downhill. The way United Airlines handled this was really absurd.” 
United has disputed Hohl’s version of events, saying the couple had repeatedly tried to sit in upgraded seats and refused to comply with requests to move back to their assigned seats. 
“We’re disappointed anytime a customer has an experience that doesn’t measure up to their expectations,” United said in a statement to KHOU . “These passengers repeatedly attempted to sit in upgraded seating which they did not purchase and they would not follow crew instructions to return to their assigned seats. We’ve been in touch with them and have rebooked them on flights tomorrow.” 
United has been engulfed by controversy since a viral video emerged depicting 69-year-old David Dao being violently dragged off a United Airlines flight after refusing to give up his seat to make room for crew members. Dao sustained injuries and plans to file a lawsuit against the airline. 
After the incident involving Dao, United enacted a new rule stipulating that crew members will no longer be allowed to displace passengers already on board the plane, the Associated Press reported. 
United spokeswoman Maggie Schmerin said in an email to the AP on Sunday that the change is an initial step in a review of policies and it’s meant to ensure that situations like Dao’s never happen again.

Scheduled operations and admissions to Cork University Hospital have been cancelled after 460 people presented at its emergency department (ED) over the bank holiday weekend, writes Claire O'Sullivan. 
Over 40% of those who turned up at the ED required admission — taking up the equivalent of six wards. 
“The hospital put additional measures in place yesterday to address this demand,” a spokesman said. 
“However it will be necessary to cancel some planned admissions to the hospital today. The position will be reviewed on a continuous basis today and tomorrow. 
“Patient care is paramount at CUH and this situation is being treated as a priority. Hospital management have requested that, where appropriate, the public contact their GP in the first instance and explore all other options available to them prior to attending the emergency department if their needs are not urgent.” 
Hospital management estimated another 150 patients would arrive at the ED by the end of yesterday and some of these will also need to be admitted. 
They have appealed to potential patients not to present at the ED unless absolutely necessary and if appropriate, to consider South Doc; the Mercy Urgent Care Centre at St Mary’s Campus, Gurranabraher; and the local injuries unit at Bantry General Hospital or MallowGeneral Hospital.

The Charities Regulator is investigating Glen, the Gay and Lesbian Network, as the NGO puts “new financial procedures” in place, 
Glen, which aims to help shape national policy for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and intersex (LGBTI) people in Ireland, is co-operating with the regulator following its own internal review. 
In a statement issued by the board of Glen, the group confirmed the regulator was examining the governance of the network. 
“The board of the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network confirms that we have received a request from the Charities Regulator for information regarding the governance of the organisation,” said the statement. 
“This arises from a request to the regulator for guidance following an internal review.” 
Glen was a leading campaigner for marriage equality during the 2015 referendum. 
The statement also said that the request to the regulator for guidance was done on the instruction of Glen’s board. 
“The request was made on the instructions of the board of Glen, which is fully co-operating with the regulator,” it stated. 
“The process is ongoing and we will work with the regulator to implement any recommended changes in our procedures.” 
The internal review of the NGO is understood to have shown up various issues of a financial nature. 
These issues were alluded to in the board’s statement as the NGO receives State funding, which comes with stringent obligations. 
“The board and staff of Glen have always been mindful of our statutory obligations,” said the board’s statement. 
“The board is satisfied that all grants received have been used for the intended purpose and has no reason to suspect there has been any misappropriation of funds. 
“Notwithstanding this, we have also put in place new financial procedures to enhance our administrative systems, including the appointment of specialist accountants.” 
Glen’s recently appointed executive director, Áine Duggan, has decided to step down from her post, according to the board. 
It is understood that Ms Duggan brought a number of irregularities at the NGO to the attention of her board. 
She then recommended that the issues be brought to the attention of the Charities Regulator. 
In the statement from Glen’s board yesterday, the NGO indicated that Ms Duggan had decided to resign from her role but acknowledged her contribution to the internal review. 
An interim executive director will now be appointed following Ms Duggan’s departure. 
The board said that, despite recent social progress such as the marriage equality referendum, when it comes to equality there is still a need for Glen. 
“Notwithstanding the result of the marriage-equality referendum and progressive social change in recent years, there is still a need for a well-resourced, ambitious national organisation and our focus in the coming months will be the ongoing development of Glen,” said the statement. 
Glen was founded in 1988 with the purpose of securing legislative changes that would bring about equality for the LGBTI population in Ireland. 
Some of its significant achievements include campaigning for the decriminalisation of homosexuality.

Hohl said that after he and Maxwell sat down, a flight attendant asked if they were in their assigned seats. When the couple said no and explained why they had moved, Hohl said the attendant denied their request for an upgrade and asked them to return to their original seats.
Hohl said that although he and Maxwell did as they were told, a US marshal boarded the flight and asked them to get off the plane. The couple said they complied with that demand as well but found the overall experience ""strange.""
""They said that we were being disorderly and a hazard to the rest of the flight, to the safety of the other customers,"" Hohl said. ""I think customer service and the airlines has gone real downhill.
""The way United Airlines handled this was really absurd,"" Hohl added.
United has disputed Hohl's version of events, saying the couple had repeatedly tried to sit in upgraded seats and refused to comply with requests to move back to their assigned seats.
""We're disappointed anytime a customer has an experience that doesn't measure up to their expectations,"" United said in a statement to KHOU . ""These passengers repeatedly attempted to sit in upgraded seating which they did not purchase, and they would not follow crew instructions to return to their assigned seats. We've been in touch with them and have rebooked them on flights tomorrow.""
United has been engulfed by controversy since a video emerged last week that showed 69-year-old David Dao being violently dragged off a flight after refusing to give up his seat to make room for crew members. Dao's attorney said on Thursday that Dao sustained injuries and planned to file a lawsuit against the airline.
United has adopted a rule that crew members can't displace passengers already on board the plane, The Associated Press reported.
Maggie Schmerin, a spokeswoman for United, said in an email to the AP on Sunday that the change was an initial step in a review of policies and was meant to ensure that situations like Dao's never happen again.

They won't have a reason to be angry after this news – the latest in the Fast and Furious series has annihilated the competition at the US box office this weekend.
The Fate of the Furious (aka Fast & Furious 8 ) is on course to set a new global debut record, with it expecting to pass the $529 million made by Star Wars: The Force Awakens in that film's opening weekend. In the US alone, the film has made a massive $100.2 million in its first week of release.
And while that debut is a big drop on F urious 7 's domestic opening, which earned over $140 million in its first first week of release , it is also more than the rest of the films in the US Top 10 managed to make this week.
Combined.

Photo credit: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock More The film's global box office is expected to be in the region of $530 million, with the film receiving a massive boost from China, where it's racked up $135 million in just the first two days of release (via Variety ).
A couple of reasons have been suggested for Furious 8 's drop in box office, ranging from the mixed reviews to the reported feud between actors Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson . There's also the fact that Furious 7 acted as a tribute to star Paul Walker , who was killed in a car crash in 2013, while Furious 8 doesn't have that same emotional resonance.
Even so, when you manage to make $80 million more than your closest rival, it's not too bad going.
And the film lagging so far behind Furious 8 is Fox and DreamWorks Animation's Alec Baldwin-starring The Boss Baby , which has been knocked off the top spot after bringing in $15.5 million.
Disney's Beauty and the Beast drops another spot down into third place, taking in $13.6 million, but we bet the studio isn't too unhappy with the fall – especially considering it recently passed the $1 billion mark worldwide and became the biggest live-action musical ever.
Rounding out the top 5 is Smurfs: The Lost Village in fourth place and Going in Style , which stars Morgan Freeman, Alan Arkin and Michael Caine in fifth.

0,Dianne E. Butts,2017-04-16T11:11:55.000+03:00,[],,,english,0,2017-04-16T11:11:55.000+03:00,,"Gleaning New Writing Projects from What You've Planted and Harvested in the Past Gleanings! This month ""Gleanings"" is on my mind. There's a reason for that. On my other blog I've been studying and writing about the ""Shemitah."" I'm currently reading a nonfiction book about it titled The Mystery of the Shemitah by Jonathan Cahn. I know what you're thinking: ""What the heck is the Shemitah?!"" I'm so glad you ask. The Shemitah is a year-event and also a day-event. The Shemitah is the 7th year in a 7-year cycle on the Jewish/Hebrew calendar. And for those Jewish people following the Old Testament regulations, they let the land rest through the 7th year or the Shemitah year. Just as in the weekly calendar God instructed one day of rest per 7-day week, in the same pattern He instructed them to let the land rest through the seventh year in a 7-year ""week"" of years, Of course this also meant the people would rest through that year because they did not work the land. But they still had to eat, right? What do they eat? Whatever grew. On its own. The gleanings. They still had to do some work because they had to go out and gather the gleanings, but they do not work the land and all the land belongs to all the people to glean wherever they want to. The whole Shemitah is really an exercise in faith. The Jewish people had to believe that God would provide for them during that year...and the next until they planted and another harvest came in. The last day of the Shemitah year is also an event. At the end of this day, all the debts are forgiven. It's a national financial re-set. Whoever owes money is set free from that debt. And whoever is owed money releases it. It's an object lesson of how the Lord God releases the sin-debt of those who trust in Him and He gives us rest. The word shemitah translated means ""the Lord's release."" Did you know we are currently living in a Shemitah year? As a matter of fact, because the Jewish calendar begins in the fall of the year (last September) we are almost half way through the Shemitah year, which will end Sunday, September 13, 2015. The exact mid-point of this Shemitah year is March 20th , so it seems appropriate to talk about the Shemitah and gleanings this month. (Plus, I only just now thought about applying this to my writing.) Gleanings for Writers Okay, I know what you're thinking: ""Enough with the Bible lesson. What does that have to do with us as writers?"" My study of the Shemitah caused ""gleanings"" to be on my mind. Suddenly I realized I already am gleaning in my writing. ( Tweet that! ) But it also gave me an awesome idea to glean another project from my past writing. ( Tweet that! ) Let me explain, and then we'll toss around some ideas for how you might glean new writing projects from what you've already planted and harvested in the past. ( Tweet that! ) Turn Gleanings into E-Books When I thought about gleaning in my writing, I realized I already am gleaning with my series of ""Getting Published"" e-books I'm releasing. You've already seen two of my titles that have released. Glean from a Pamphlet The first e-book I made, ""How to Get Published,"" was gleaned from a pamphlet I wrote back in 2003, printed on 11 x 17 paper, folded as multi-page pamphlets, and sold at writers conferences. I took the same information, updated it, and released it as a Kindle book last year. It continues to sell well on Kindle. only $.99 Cutting the Passive Voice Glean from an Article The second e-book, ""Cutting the Passive Voice,"" came out a few months ago. The information for this little Kindle book was gleaned from an article I wrote back in the '90s. It was published a few times in small Christian writer's magazines. It's still good and helpful information and I wanted to share it with more writers and make it available to a much larger audience. I still owned all the rights to it, so I renewed and refreshed it, added a little more information, and formatted it into a Kindle book. It's been selling quite well since its release, which is exciting and encourages me to do more. Glean from a Workshop You Teach You may remember I ask through a survey which e-book you'd like me to create next and I gave three options. Here are the results so far: Ten Tools for Marketing Your Book - 83% of votes The Shape of Story: How to Shape your Novel's Story to Make a Great Screenplay - 17% of votes Query Letters: How to Write the Query (and Cover) Letter You Dread to Magazine Editors and Book Publishers - 8% of votes You can vote for more than one which is why they add up to more than 100%. For the first two I will glean material from workshops I teach on those topics. The project on Query Letters I will glean from another pamphlet I wrote back in 2003. Pre-Order now! Glean from a Blog While I waited for the survey results to come it, I've been working on another e-book. Book Signings: How to Set Up Your In-Store Author Event and What to Do While You're There! contains a ton of information I gleaned from three different posts on this blog. While the material is already available for free here on the blog, I feel there's value in gathering it all together into one product for easy access instead of the reader having to hop around searching on this blog. Besides, I'm sure there are a lot of readers who don't even realize this information is available here so they don't know to go searching for it. Plus, readers can keep the e-book handy on their e-reader for easy reference when needed. Furthermore, I believe the e-book will reach a whole new audience of authors who can use the information but who don't even know about this blog. Therefore it may even bring new readers to the blog. This e-book isn't completely ready to go at this date, but it is available for pre-order right now. That means you can order it and you will receive it as soon as it releases. What has me especially excited right now is that while I was thinking about the Shemitah, and while I suddenly thought to apply ""gleanings"" to my writing, I realized I have a TON of information on my other blog about the Shemitah, the current tetrad of lunar eclipses (being called the ""Blood Moons""), the 7 Feasts of the Lord on which these eclipses are falling, the solar eclipse on March 20 at the mid-point of the Shemitah year, and so much more along with the spiritual and prophetic meaning of it all. Again, all this information is spattered through many posts over the past year on my Bible Prophecies Fulfilled blog . So why not gather all of that information into an e-book?! Again, this is a ton of writing and research I have already completed. I can organize all this information for easy reading in one place so readers can find it easily and keep it on their e-reader for easy access. I can reach a whole new audience. This will give me another income stream. And I can bring readers to my blog who don't know about it right now. Why didn't I think of this e-book before?! You can bet I'll be at work on it to get it out as soon as I can. What Do You Have to Glean? So the question for you is, what material do you have that's already written that you could re-purpose into a Kindle e-book and share with the world? ( Tweet that! ) And it doesn't have to be material that has already been published. What about that project of your heart that never got published? You can make your material available on platforms other than Kindle through Smashwords.com . I learned how to format for Kindle by printing out their instructions. It's not that hard. In fact, I put those printed instructions in page-protectors and in a small notebook and I refer to them and walk through them step by step whenever I'm making a new Kindle book. Turn Gleanings into Videos If you follow my other blog, you saw in my December posts that I created videos for my posts for the Christmas Advent season . What material can you glean that you can turn into videos? You can take your writing material and tell it to your laptop's camera, edit it on YouTube.com, and upload it to YouTube. Then you can share that video on your blog, your web site, on Facebook, and probably other places I haven't thought of. When you say it in video, you reach an entirely new audience. Many people don't want to read. They want to see and hear. So glean material from your books, articles, blogs, and more and make a video. Even if you're only reading your article or a section of a book! I've been asked to make some of my Bible Prophecy Fulfilled blog posts into videos by just reading them. I haven't got that far yet but I'd like to. That way busy people can hear me read my own blog posts while they are busily doing something else. It works. It's a whole new audience. What material do you have that would make a great video or series of short videos? Turn Gleanings into Articles Perhaps all writers have an abundance of material we've gathered and researched for writing projects. What work have you already done that you can glean articles from? Or, can you take some material you've put into articles and create other material from it, such as an e-book or series of blog posts? Can you take your fiction and make it into a series of short stories for your blog or a series of short e-books? ( Tweet that! ) Turn Gleanings into Books and More We've talked about gleaning material you've written and creating e-books. But what about print books? Do you have an abundance of material you can gather together and have enough for a print book? ( Tweet that! ) You could add more material, if you want. Update it. Freshen it. What can you add? Maybe add an appendix, list, or chart. For my new Book Signings e-book I added a list I use when preparing for an in-a-bookstore book signing. That list is material that I haven't published before. It's not on this blog. So it's added value to the e-book. For the e-book on the Blood Moons and all that related information, I think I'll add a Leader's Guide to the back of the book. That will be new material I will need to create, but it will help readers share the incredibly important information in the book. It will make it easier to lead a discussion with a group of interested people. Maybe you can glean from stories you've written and use them to create a screenplay or take your nonfiction and make a documentary. The ideas truly are endless. Renew and Release Take a fresh look at the material you've already produced. Take a special look at the unpublished material you've created that has never found a home to be published in. Review it. Glean from it. Renew and refresh it. Reuse it. Re-purpose it. Then release it to accomplish that purpose for which it was created. May your gleanings of new writing projects from what you've already planted and harvested in the past provide you with an abundant blessing of new products, new readers benefiting from your work, and new income streams!

Former naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav is not the only Indian in Pakistan’s custody on charges of spying. There are 13 others lodged in Pakistan jails, facing similar charges.More than 30 Pakistanis too were found to be lodged in Indian prisons – either convicted on charges of spying or facing trial — as per a 2015 list. 
Jadhav is also not the only Indian to whom Pakistan has denied consular access. 
The neighbouring country earlier refused consular access to Hamid Nehal Ansari, a 27-year-old management teacher from Mumbai, who went to Pakistan in search of a woman he fell in love on Facebook. 
He disappeared after reaching Kohat near Peshawar. Later, during a court hearing in Pakistan, it transpired Ansari is in the custody of Pakistani intelligence agencies. 
In all there are 208 Indians in Pakistani jail. Among them 174 are fishermen. 
“Among the civilian prisoners, 13 are facing espionage charges,” said a government source. 
India and Pakistan started exchanging list of nationals of each country lodged in other country’s jails following an agreement on consular access signed in 2008. 
Under the agreement, twice every year — on January 1 and July 1 — both the countries exchange the lists of prisoners (civil as well as fishermen) through diplomatic channels simultaneously at New Delhi and Islamabad. 
Despite a chill in relations between the two countries, the last exchange of lists took place on January 1 this year. 
At the time of last such exchange, the ministry of external affairs had said India remained committed to addressing with Pakistan on priority the humanitarian matters, including those pertaining to prisoners and fishermen in each other’s country. 
“In this context, we await from Pakistan confirmation of nationality of those in India’s custody who are otherwise eligible for release and repatriation. We also await consular access to those Indian nationals in Pakistan’s custody for whom it has so far not been provided including Hamid Nehal Ansari and Kulbhushan Jadhav,” said an Indian external affairs ministry’s statement during the exchange of list. 
Of the Pakistani nationals facing trial or undergoing sentence on the charges of spying in India, many have served their sentence but can’t be deported as Pakistan refuses to accept them as its citizens. 
Sajeed Muneer, for instance, spent about 12 years in Indian jail for espionage before being released on June 5 last year. Pakistan does not acknowledge him as its national and hasn’t responded to India’s request to take him back. For the past 10 months, Bhopal police are taking care of his daily needs at a safe location. 
Masood Akhtar, another Pakistani national accused of being an ISI agent, was sentenced to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment in 2003. He was due for release but is still lodged in Ambala central jail. Jail officials say till the time they don’t get communication for his deportation from the ministry of foreign affairs, he will not be released. 
The district magistrate issues orders every month for the extension of his imprisonment. 
Activists of an Indo-Pak peace initiative,’ Aaghaz-e-Dosti’ had accessed both the lists that were exchanged on July 1, 2015 through Right to Information Act in India. 
The list had names of 251 Pak prisoners lodged in Indian jails. HT reviewed the charges against them and found that 31 among them were lodged either on the charges of collecting secret information or violation of Official Secrets Act. 
Professor Bhim Singh, a patron of the National Panthers Party, has been fighting for release of those Pakistani prisoners who have completed their sentence and eligible for release. 
“I filed a petition in the Supreme Court in 2005 and hearing is still on in the matter. Following the litigation, on the directions of the top court, more than 500 Pakistani prisoners have been released,” Singh told HT. 
Singh is approaching the Pakistani Supreme Court for providing legal aide to Jadhav. 
India was about to release around a dozen Pakistani prisoners but following the announcement of death sentence to Kulbhushan Jadhav by a Pakistani military court, it has decided to put on hold the release.","Kulbhushan Jadhav death sentence: India, Pakistan hold many ‘agents’ in each other’s custody",http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozhwm4mOXSgYL.MOKiMh.voySwxmXEHBkNCVrbwiKyHMkO0kecBlyXURD.3H0MstDW39y4KRWBqsLO92bZJ7.0t00KjVJV4pXO_nQrXq8S776IJX7a6wGU2683nQMJQoxrk6eyd6Hl.YQ--,11a343b3c55f7db3aa0e48ef4412b3055bd69bdb,idrw.org,http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/04/16/Pictures/_15142c7a-2243-11e7-a5a9-704c25d3160d.jpg,http://idrw.org/feed/,Indian Defence Research Wing,IN,32785.0,0,idrw.org,1,"Kulbhushan Jadhav death sentence: India, Pakistan hold many ‘agents’ in each other’s custody",0.0,news,0,"[{'sentiment': 'negative', 'name': 'kulbhushan jadhav'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'hamid nehal ansari'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'sunil'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'masood akhtar'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'david'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'sajeed muneer'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'daniel mashi'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'singh'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'jadhav'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ansari'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'bhim singh'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'pakistan'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'india'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'new delhi'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'kohat'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'peshawar'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ambala'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'mumbai'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'islamabad'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'bhopal'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'pakistani supreme court'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'national panthers party'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'supreme court'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'facebook'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'isi'}]"

Miss Universe, actress, model, producer - the birthday girl, Lara Dutta, has worn many hats within the span of an almost two-decade long career. Her journey in the limelight started when she won the annual Gladrags Megamodel India competition in 1995. From then till now, she has been able to stay relevant to her fans by the virtue of being a confident, spunky, and sassy badass! 
She was born to a Punjabi father and an Anglo-Indian mother in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh on April 16, 1978. She was three-years-old when her family moved to Bangalore. Thanks to her upbringing, Dutta is fluent in English, Hindi, Punjabi, as well as Kannada. 
After securing the first place at the Miss Intercontinental Pageant in 1997, she went on to win the crown of Femina Miss India Universe in 2000. At the Miss Universe Pageant in 2000, Dutta received the highest individual score in the history of the contest because her final interview blew the judges' minds! She scored a 9.99; something no else had achieved before. She also won the crown; the second Indian to do so ever. The same year Priyanka Chopra won the Miss World title and Dia Mirza won the Miss Asia Pacific one. 
Soon after it was announced in 2001 that Dutta has been appointed as the UNFPA Goodwill Ambassador working on issue mainly related to gender sensitivity and the HIV-AIDS crisis in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Lara then made her Bollywood debut in 2003 with the film Andaaz , where she co-starred with Priyanka Chopra and Akshay Kumar. She won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for her role. 
The year 2011, saw several new milestones in her life - both personal and professional. She tied the knot with celebrated tennis player Mahesh Bhupathi on February 16, and on August 1 she announced the news of her pregnancy. If her adorable Instagram posts with her daughter Saira, who was born on January 2012, are anything to go by, she seems like a super-fun mom.

On the work front, her first film as a producer, Chalo Dilli was release on April 29, 2011. The film starring Vinay Pathak, Akshay Kumar, and Lara herself received positive reviews from critics. She has started working on her second production as well. 
But, that's not all! Apart from her Bollywood career and social work, Lara also happens to be a trained classical dancer, avid sports enthusiast, and yoga and fitness freak. Is there anything this wonder woman can't do? 
Thank you for being the fun, spunky, sassy inspiration in our millennial Bollywood hearts, Lara! Happy Birthday!","Happy Birthday, Lara Dutta!

By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Published:April 16, 2017 5:24 pm Begum Jaan box office collection day 3: Vidya Balan plays a brothel madam in the film. 
Begum Jaan starring Vidya Balan seems to be struggling at the box office. The film didn’t show growth on the second day as was expected. Instead, the film witnessed a drop in collections on Saturday. Begum Jaan collected Rs 3.50 crore on the second day in comparison to Rs 3.94 crore on opening day. The dip in the collection could be due to the Good Friday holiday on the first day. Trade analyst Taran Adarsh tweeted the figures, “#BegumJaan declines on Day 2… Fri 3.94 cr, Sat 3.50 cr. Total: ? 7.44 cr. India biz.” The film could see a spike in collections on Sunday and collect a decent weekend collection. 
Vidya has not been able to give a hit during past few years. Her last few films Kahaani 2 and Hamari Adhuri Kahani failed to do well at box office. Director Srijit Mukherji, however, doesn’t seem to be bogged down by mixed reviews that film got from critics. In a recent post on Facebook , Srijit wrote, “For the statistically inclined, delighted to announce that despite mixed reviews, FF8, big regional new year releases and being an A rated film, #BegumJaan opened to 3.94 cr as opposed to the industry expectation of 3-3.25 cr and an ORMAX prediction of 3.4 cr. Thank you for all the bouquets and brickbats.” #BegumJaan declines on Day 2… Fri 3.94 cr, Sat 3.50 cr. Total: ? 7.44 cr. India biz.

The film is getting some tough competition from Hollywood action thriller Fast and Furious 8 starring Vin Diesel. There have also been some big regional releases that could be a reason behind Begum Jaan’s dismal show at the box office. Films like Pa Pandi (Tamil), Sakhavu (Malayalam) and Manje Bistre (Punjabi) have got positive reviews. Earlier Taran tweeted about the same, “#BegumJaan had a slow start… Evening shows better… #Furious8 wave + huge start of Punjabi film #ManjeBistre in North made a dent.”

Begum Jaan was made on a moderate budget of Rs 14-15 crore and has recovered half of the investment from satellite and digital sales. Makers also found a huge tax relief of Rs 2 crore after the film has been declared tax-free in Jharkhand.

The symbolism of the Dalai Lama's week-long visit to Arunachal Pradesh, his seventh to the state including his arrival 58 years ago, wasn't lost on local residents. In the monastery town of Tawang, where the Tibetan spiritual leader first arrived in India in 1959, aged 23, after a perilous 15-day journey across the Tibetan plateau, thousands lined up on April 6 to receive him. ""This is a very special visit for us,"" said local businessman Jambey Lobsang, 28, ""because I don't think the Dalai Lama may come back given his age. He is energetic, but we mustn't forget he is 81."" 
Tawang is where the remarkable 58 year journey in exile began for Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama. Tawang is also where the final chapter of his leadership of the Tibetan movement may begin. Although he is a very healthy 81 - and Tibetans understandably don't even want to contemplate life after the 14th Dalai Lama - the question of his succession looms ever larger. And Tawang, the birthplace of the 6th Dalai Lama, is for many the most likely location where a reincarnation could be chosen. 
This significance wasn't lost on China, which responded more angrily than it had done during the Dalai Lama's previous visits to Arunachal. Besides his 1959 arrival, the Tibetan spiritual leader has visited in 1983, 1997, twice in 2003 and in 2009. On April 5, Beijing summoned the Indian Ambassador in Beijing Vijay Gokhale - as it had done in earlier visits, and most recently when Prime Minister Modi visited Arunachal last year. But the Foreign Ministry also warned it would take ""necessary measures"" to defend its sovereignty, and accused India of ""violating its solemn commitments on Tibet-related issues"". In the eyes of some Chinese officials, statements by Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu, who said the state bordered Tibet and not China, as well as remarks by the Dalai Lama criticising Chinese rule in Tibet, had ""violated"" India's commitments that Tibet is part of China and it wouldn't allow ""anti-China"" political activities. 
""Definitely this time the stridency of their tone and the kind of language they have used and frequency of their comments is far more than we had seen earlier,"" said Ashok Kantha, India's envoy in Beijing until 2016 and director of the Institute of Chinese Studies, who was also handling relations with China at the Ministry of External Affairs in Delhi at the time of the earlier visits in 1997 and 2003. 
China's response 
Both in Delhi and in Beijing, the Tawang visit has been seen as a shift in India's diplomacy. Supporters of the Modi government say India is finally standing up to China - ironically, a view echoed in Beijing, where State newspapers said India was ""playing the Tibet card"". Hu Shisheng, a scholar at the China Institutes for Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, said the visit was ""part of a series policies the Indian government has been taking in playing the Tibet card,"" referring to the Dalai Lama being hosted in December for the first time at Rashtrapati Bhavan along with other Nobel laureates, and Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju accompanying him to Arunachal. 
""It seems to me that this [the Modi] government's Tibet policy is Americanised,"" said Hu. ""When nearly all the other countries are respecting China's Tibet policy and hold themselves aloof from the Dalai Lama and his group, only the Americans and Indians are still loving to play this card to embarrass or even to disgust China. Modi's government from the very beginning has been stirring up this issue once and again, from inviting Lobsang Sangay [the Sikyong, or ""prime minister in exile""] to attend the inauguration of Prime Minister Modi, to the meeting between the Indian President and Dalai Lama, from the parliament member talking about awarding the Bharat Ratna to the Dalai Lama, to being accompanied by the minister to the disputed area between India and China. What is much worse is the so-called chief minister even saying that his state does not share a boundary with China. This is really too much."" 
How is China likely to respond? Hu says ""China has various resources to deal with such deliberate anti-China policies, like suspending some interaction mechanisms."" Lin Minwang, a strategic affairs expert in Fudan University in Shanghai, adds, ""China has many 'cards' which can be used to counter India, but it would be unwise to try to put economic costs to India or stop some exchanges. This is not the way China conducts its foreign policy."" In the past, with respect to India, Beijing's strong statements didn't lead to specific actions, in contrast to steps China has taken with other countries that hosted the Dalai Lama, most recently Mongolia, which saw a brief suspension of diplomatic and trade ties. 
The sense is Beijing has one eye on the BRICS Summit it is hosting in September, which China hopes will be a grand success, without disruptions, and will showcase Xi Jinping as a global leader. BRICS will take place barely a month before the key once-in-five-year 19th Party Congress, where Xi will hope to consolidate his authority and promote his acolytes. It also remains unlikely China will disrupt a busy calendar of exchanges between both countries in the lead up to BRICS, with three Indian ministers - Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Power Minister Piyush Goyal -expected in June and July, and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval also due for the BRICS NSAs meeting. And for now, China is preoccupied with its major One Belt, One Road forum that Xi Jinping will host in May, with 20 heads of state likely to attend. Somewhat fortunately, there are no major engagements with India until then, yet Beijing could still choose to flex its muscles. 
The Tibet Card 
Beyond the optics, has there been a change in India's approach? ""If there is any change, it is actually on the Chinese side, not on the Indian side,"" said Kantha, the former envoy, suggesting India, in fact, had been very consistent in allowing the Dalai Lama to travel. Kantha makes a persuasive case to underline that the seventh visit, in many respects, reflected more continuity than change, and that perhaps the difference this time was more in Beijing's response. ""Gradually, they have become more strident in their tone,"" he says. ""All Indian leaders including the present Prime Minister have received the Dalai Lama. We didn't go out of the way to publicise these meetings. This is a perfectly routine practice we have pursued for 60 years. It is fairly routine for local chief ministers and dignitaries to receive him too."" 
As for China's argument that the presence of Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju in the first stop in Arunachal underlined that this visit was qualitatively different and ""official"", Kantha dismisses that notion, pointing out that ""the minister comes from Arunachal so accompanying him is not being done by the Government of India to make a point. If the MoS Home wasn't from the state, it's very unlikely a central government minister would have travelled all the way."" The visit, Kantha adds, did not violate any of India's commitments on Tibet. India's position on Tibet being a part of China still stands. ""There is nothing we have done that runs counter to that and by no stretch of imagination can this visit be described as an anti-China activity,"" he adds. ""The Dalai Lama travels extensively as you are aware, both within and outside India. Can we really tell him he cannot go to Arunachal? The Chinese should sit back and think. The visit to Arunachal for us was on par with him visiting Himachal Pradesh, or Tamil Nadu for that matter."" 
The idea that India can use the Dalai Lama as ""a card"" has been suggested by both Indian strategic experts, who see it as easy leverage, and more recently by the Chinese media, that has alleged the recent visit was proof of India ""playing the Dalai Lama card"". Kantha, however, describes it as ""a figment of the imagination"". ""I don't see the Dalai Lama being used by the Government of India. The way the Government of India manages our relations, it's not in such a tactical way. What does the Government of India get out of it? Does it yield any tangible returns?"" Nirupama Rao, former foreign secretary and former envoy to China, says the Tibet card ""is a stereotyped cliche that if Tibet is not China's, it is ours to gain"". ""We have no ulterior motives in Tibet. Our brief is not Curzonian,"" says Rao. ""India has held the line on Tibet with biblical patience all these years."" Rao says, adding that ""Beijing cannot claim even a modicum of moral ground on this issue"". 
Changing China 
The challenge facing India is a greater Chinese assertiveness on its ""core"" interests, and Tibet and Taiwan are top of the list. When the new U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to review the 'One China policy' and had a telephone call with the Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, Beijing threatened to cut off all contact and did not arrange the first telephone call between Xi Jinping and Trump until the U.S. President agreed to publicly reaffirm the 'One China policy'. Xi called Trump only after he agreed to do an embarrassing u-turn on his campaign trail bluster. With Chinese sensitivities already unnerved by Trump, there is a sense that the Dalai Lama's visit, shortly after, perhaps triggered a greater than usual outburst. 
Rao, the former foreign secretary, says India shouldn't cave in to Chinese assertiveness. ""China sees Tawang as 'disputed territory' and is deeply suspicious and insecure about the Dalai Lama's aura and the weight of his global persona. With this latest development it is as if two atoms have collided. The Chinese have shown little sensitivity to India's well-justified grievances on Masood Azhar or their activities in PoK. Rolling over and playing dead cannot be an option for a self-respecting large country like India,"" she says. ""The Chinese keep talking about the sentiments of the Chinese people and how their government cannot ignore them. The same thumb rule applies for the Indian people, too."" 
Succession Question 
Another possible explanation for China's fiery response is its increasing anxiety on the succession question. If the 15th Dalai Lama were chosen from Tawang, Beijing is aware that she or he could emerge as a far more credible successor than the candidate that China will put forward. ""The Chinese are laying down markers in terms of controlling the process,"" says Kantha, ""and its likely to become a contentious issue."" Hence, as the Dalai Lama visited Tawang, China's government, as well as its offiical Tibetologists, came out with strong statements reaffirming Beijing's stand on the succession question. ""The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must be conducted according to religious rituals and historical conventions including drawing of lots from the Golden Urn in front of the Buddha statue at the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, which embodies the Buddhist spirit, and not by what the 14th Dalai Lama has said,"" the Foreign Ministry said. 
Lian Xiangmin, Director of Institute of Contemporary Tibetan Studies at the official China Tibetology Research Centre that advises the government on Tibet policy, said his hope was that ""the Dalai Lama's succession should be found in his homeland, that is China"". ""There are six million Tibetan people. Apart from religious followers who are Tibetan there are also people of other ethnic groups who follow Tibetan Buddhism. I believe they hope to see the 14th Dalai Lama produced in China. So far, there have been 14 Dalai Lamas produced in China."" 
Yet Beijing knows that if the Dalai Lama chooses a successor on his own terms, it will likely face a huge challenge in pushing the credibility of its candidate, as underlined by the difficulties China has faced in promoting its candidate for the 11th Panchen Lama, who hasn't been given a high public profile by Beijing. Nirupama Rao, the former foreign secretary, argues that this is an issue in which India has a stake. ""We are stakeholders because we cannot abandon the interests of the Tibetans who live in India. The window is open during the lifetime of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Our position should be that the religious and cultural sanctity of the process of succession should be respected and upheld above all. We should be flag bearers on this aspect."" 
""The world, not just India, consciously abandoned Tibet to its fate in 1950,"" adds Rao. ""Only His Holiness the Dalai Lama retains his sanctity in this sorry narrative. While Tibet cannot be a geopolitical pawn on the India-versus-China chessboard, given the Chinese stand on the McMahon Line, our signing on the dotted line of confirmation of Tibet as a part of China put us in a twist, condemned to strategic purgatory, neither in heaven nor hell. Hindsight is a hurtful thing."" 
Uncertain Future 
With an increasingly assertive China, coupled with the growing prominence of the succession issue, the Tibet question is emerging again as a prominent factor in India's relations. China's claims on Tawang have grown louder since they were first voiced in 1985, and despite a border agreement signed between both countries in 2005 that both sides would take into account the interests of settled populations when arriving at a mutually acceptable solution for the boundary dispute. 
In Tawang, many fear this may be the Dalai Lama's last visit, even though the Arunachal Pradesh state government has invited him back to conduct a Kalachakra initiation, which would, in all certainty, trigger another diplomatic row with China. For Tawang's residents, however, China is far from their minds. A greater concern is poor roads and bad infrastructure. A 20 km drive into Tawang takes one hour. Few in Tawang are willing to speak about the succession question, which is a highly emotive topic. No one, understandably, wants to contemplate life after the 14th Dalai Lama. Among younger residents, some are aware China will have its say on the reincarnation, given the Panchen Lama controversy. 
Few in Tawang saw the Dalai Lama's visit as being any different from the his previous one in 2009. As then, the entire Tawang town was decked up in flowers, prayer flags, as well as Indian and Tibetan flags. Also as in 2009, there appeared to be some hesitation from the government, as the Tibetan flags vanished overnight in some places, although not at the famous Tawang monastery. Uncertainties notwithstanding, for Lama Lobsang, the caretaker of the Urgeyling Monastery in Tawang where the sixth Dalai Lama was born, the future couldn't be more clear. ""China,"" he says simply, ""should mind its own business.""

A compelling story in the New York Times titled ‘ In India, A Small Band of Women Risk It all For A Chance to Work ’ in January 2016, highlighted the struggle of Indian women to access the labour market, and work and earn a living with respect. The narrative wove in stories of two friends — Geeta and Premwati — of Peepli Khera village, even as it laid bare the disturbing gender inequality in India’s work force. 
The author — Ellen Barry, NYT 's South Asia Bureau chief — says the story was among the most challenging ones she pursued during her four-year stint in India, which comes to an end this August. 
“This is a subject I care about passionately: If more Indian women are able to earn for their families, I think that will have an enormous impact on the treatment and education of girls, age at first marriage and first childbirth, and problems like dowry-related violence and female feticide,” said Barry via an e-mail. It is a problem that she believes has gotten far too little attention from the government and the research community. “It is a challenging subject because it is complex and not as shocking or attention-grabbing as problems like rape or honour killing. It was important to me to shift the focus.” Ellen Barry's report on Indian women's struggles to access the labour market, as seen on the New York Times website 
This story is also an absolute favourite of Barry’s friend and colleague Geeta Anand, who also liked her second piece about young women (working) in manufacturing in Bengaluru, on the same subject. “She (Ellen) spent months with these women, finding those telltale anecdotes and descriptions that elevated the pieces into great literature. They are fresh stories and they are among the best narrative nonfiction I have ever read,” says Anand, via an e-mail. 
Barry’s quick turn-around time and great writing skills makes the mother of two daughters one of the most sought after journalists in the field. “I loved her story about the injuries to protestors’ eyes in Kashmir,” says Anand. “Read it. I was amazed that she could turn around a news feature in just two or three days and that it could be so compellingly written and deeply reported. She begins by describing the eye surgery to repair a damaged eye. Read it,” she repeats. 
Barry though is never satisfied with her work and is always striving to be better. “I think Ellen’s great strength, besides her great talent, is her self-criticism. It’s hard to give her a compliment, because she doesn’t quite believe it,” says Anand. “Every story of hers that you tell her was great, she’ll point out the things that weren’t quite up to her standard, where she should have done more. This tortures her. But it makes her a better and better journalist with every passing year.” 
In 2011, while posted in Russia, Barry was part of a team which won the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for highlighting instances of impunity in the country’s justice system and also covered the resurgence of Russia’s Cossacks; a meteor that slammed into the atmosphere there and a scandal at the Bolshoi Ballet, which started with a dancer throwing acid into the face of creative director. Ellen Barry will leave India this August, when her four-year stint as South Asia bureau chief for the New York Times ends. Image courtesy Ellen Barry's Facebook page 
In August 2013, after five years in the former Soviet space, Barry was exhilarated to be India, which she says is a wonderful place to report as people are not afraid to speak their mind in public, including to reporters. “It is a free society in that sense. More frustrating is that top officials rarely feel compelled to answer challenging questions about policy and performance, which makes it difficult for journalists to hold them accountable,” says Barry. “This country is full of excellent, courageous journalists. They need institutional support from outlets and their owners in order to hold leaders' feet to the fire.” 
As a bureau chief who shapes coverage of South Asia, Barry’s extremely ambitious, stays well informed and is constantly looking for how to tell the most important stories of the region is the most compelling way, says Anand. 
Of Barry's understanding and coverage of India, Anand says Ellen is among a handful of westerners she has met who have amazed her with how rapidly they can understand a country, its history, its politics and its people. “And so she wrote knowledgeably and with subtlety and compassion and curiosity about India.” 
Anand also goes on to say that Barry’s are almost always the best stories on whatever topics she tackles. “Her strengths are her speed and her intelligence and her writing talent. She’s also extremely hard working. Many people who are as talented writers might try to cut corners on the reporting. But Ellen makes twice as many calls as most reporters I know, and then begins writing. That means her stories are not only accurate but incredibly in-depth.” 
Not everyone is as pleased with Barry's work. Avirook Sen, author of the book Aarushi , based on the double murder in Noida, picked on Barry at an event for her critical review of his book. “I wrote a critical review of Avirook Sen’s book on the murder investigation. He did not like my review,” puts Barry simply. 
Come August, at the end of the stipulated four-year posting in any country by NYT , she will head to London to take on new responsibilities as Chief International Correspondent and is free to write on any region where she finds compelling stories, including India. But she plans to focus on Europe. “I am interested in the rise of right-wing populism and nationalism in the west. This is a process I observed in Russia, where I was posted between 2008 and 2013. It also reflects political changes going on in the United States and the decline in the US's global influence,” says Barry. 
Anand thinks that Barry has elevated the standard of journalism in India. “When you read an Ellen Barry story, you knew it would be deeply reported and accurate and you knew it would be written more compellingly than anything else on the subject,"" says Anand. ""Her project on working women in India is the best feature writing I’ve read since I’ve been here.""

Week 33 of the English Premier League sees Spurs closing the gap to four points, with six games to go, after destroying Bournemouth at home while Chelsea lost to Man Utd at Old Trafford. 
Spurs closed the gap to just four points after annihilating Bournemouth 4-0 at White Hart Lane. It was Spurs 12 th home league win on the spin, and 15 in all competitions. The place is a relative fortress. 
Bournemouth didn’t half make it easy though. Eddie Howe’s side has not won a Premier League game away from home this side of the New Year festivities, and he must be concerned about the way his team have lacked desire once safe, particularly since they finished last season in the same way. 
Harry Kane returned to the starting lineup for the first time since injuring his ankle. It was a solid comeback scoring one and assisting for Son Heung-Min to score his 19 th goal of the season. Kane’s delightful turn and finish was his 13 th goal in 13 games and 20 goals in the Premier League. He is only the third player behind Alan Shearer, Ruud van Nistelrooy, and Thierry Henry to score 20+ league goals three seasons on the tamp. Moussa Dembele and Vincent Janssen were also on the scoresheet. 
Last week , Spurs played earlier than Chelsea and won by 4-0, but Chelsea replied with a notable victory of their own. This week, Antonio Conte’s side were in a similar spot, only you had a feeling that Man Utd at Old Trafford was going to be an entirely different proposition than playing Bournemouth. 
There is nobody who knows Chelsea better than Jose Mourinho, and he used all of that experience to put one over Conte. Despite scoring 17 league goals this season, Mourinho relegated Zlatan Ibrahimovic to the substitute’s bench preferring the lightning quick duo of Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard. 
The two youngsters were a nightmare for the Chelsea backline, and it was Rashford who opened the scoring in the seventh minute after latching on to a superb through-ball from the industrious Ander Herrera, barely a minute after the future England star had another great opportunity to open the scoring. 
The other crucial decision Jose Mourinho made was to do a man-marking job on Eden Hazard. Herrera was superb in the role and had the little Belgian on a leash all afternoon, and he still had time to seal the points for United with a deflected shot in the 49 th minute – his first Premier League goal of the season. 
It was a big day for Spurs, but to highlight the gargantuan task ahead of them if they are to overtake the Blues, Chelsea is going to have to lose another two games in six, with Spurs going through the season unbeaten. 
Here is the run in and you have to say, Spurs have the tougher task with three London derbies, Man Utd in a Champions League race, and Hull desperate to escape relegation. Chelsea, on the other hand, has a tough trip to Everton, and that’s about it. 
But the pair face each other in the semi-final of the FA Cup at the weekend. If Spurs can beat Chelsea in that game then maybe the seeds of doubt planted at Old Trafford may begin to stretch towards the light?

While North Korea has been taking up the headlines of US Vice-President Pence’s trip to South Korea and Japan, a little noticed meeting is taking place tomorrow in Tokyo that could spark the re-ignition of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that new President Trump ditched almost immediately after coming into office. It is worth remembering that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was among the first world leaders to meet with Trump in Miami, and now Vice-President Pence is scheduled to meet with Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso on Tuesday. 
Japan is looking to get the United States back on track as regards the aborted TPP deal, and will be asking Washington to show some sort of commitment to Asia-Pac Free Trade. If necessary, Tokyo is prepared to go it without the United States. Mr Aso, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said last week “I want Japan and US to take the lead in creating (trade) rules that other nations in the region can adopt.”

Tokyo sees the TPP, which would have covered 40% of all global trade, as a “gold standard” of trade deals, given its inclusion of provisions not usually found in most trade deals, such as labor standards and governance and transparency standards. Japan is now working to resurrect the pact with just 11 members, local media reported yesterday. The other signatories are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. 
It remains unclear whether a “TPP-lite” agreement without the United States would be of much use or interest to countries such as Malaysia and Vietnam. These two in particular would have benefited from the US market open to them for the sale of raw products, while American businesses in both food and textiles would have benefited by securing a non-Chinese source of raw materials and by adding value to create end consumer products – a point seemingly lost on the Trump administration. It also remains unclear whether Japan would countenance any Chinese involvement. The TPP itself may be a dead deal, but it is possible it could be re-invented under a “Trump TPP” that he can be seen to approve and that would still secure for American business interests, raw Asian materials at zero import tariffs for them to add value too, and spin it as a “job creating” exercise. With the Trump administration capable of U-turns and learning fast on the job, Vice-President Pence may yet come away from Tokyo with clearer thoughts about the United States trade involvement with Asia.

TOKYO: U.S. Vice President Mike Pence kicked off talks with Japan on Tuesday the White House hopes will open doors for U.S. goods and attract infrastructure investment, after seeking to reassure Washington’s key ally amid rising tensions over North Korea. 
Pence first joined a working lunch with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe before meeting Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso for economic talks that the vice president said he hoped would yield a framework for further dialogue. 
Earlier, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met Japan’s trade minister, Hiroshige Seko. Ross, seen as more hardline on trade, told reporters Washington was eager to increase trade ties with Tokyo through a two-way agreement. 
Pence landed in Tokyo from South Korea after a trip that included a visit to the heavily fortified border separating the North and South. He described the U.S.-Japan alliance as the “cornerstone” of regional security. 
Pence’s 10-day tour of Asia is aimed at emphasizing that U.S. President Donald Trump wants to boost U.S. trade in the region even though Trump has abandoned the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact. 
Advocates for the TPP, negotiated by former President Barack Obama and supported by Abe, said it would have opened markets for American exports. U.S. business groups supported the deal but U.S. labor unions argued it would hurt American workers. 
Trump campaigned for office on an “America First” platform, saying he would boost U.S. manufacturing jobs and shrink the country’s trade deficit with countries like Japan. 
Trump also vowed to renegotiate existing regional trade deals to focus on bilateral agreements. Tokyo is wary of a two-way free trade agreement (FTA), fearing it would boost pressure to open up politically sensitive sectors such as agriculture. 
“It’s a little bit early to say just what forms things will take but we are certainly eager to increase our trade relationships with Japan and to do so in the form of an agreement,” Ross said when asked about a possible FTA. 
TRADE IMBALANCES 
Japan had a US$69 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, the U.S. Treasury Department said, expressing concern over what it called the “persistence” of the imbalance. 
Japanese officials counter that Tokyo accounts for a much smaller chunk of America’s deficit than in the past, while China’s imbalance is much bigger. 
Trump has complained that Japan keeps its currency artificially low, although a Treasury Department report last week did not label Japan a currency manipulator. The issue was not expected to be raised in talks on Tuesday. 
Pence said in Seoul earlier on Tuesday the Trump administration would review and reform a 5-year-old free trade agreement with South Korea. 
The Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association expressed concern about any review of the pact, which removed tariffs on auto trade between the two countries. 
Trump and Abe agreed in February to have Pence and Aso, who is also Japan’s finance minister, open an economic dialogue. The two sides were expected to agree on principles and a process for further detailed discussions between ministries. 
“Obviously, the first high-level talk is not going to have an immediate resolution of anything but I think we have a reasonable path forward,” Ross said. 
Aso told reporters before the talks he would not discuss any bilateral free trade deal with Pence. The White House adviser said Tuesday’s talks would not prescribe a free-trade deal but talks might eventually lead to such negotiations. 
INDIANA TIES 
Pence developed ties with Japanese business and political leaders as governor of Indiana, a state that is home to Subaru , Honda and Toyota plants, and about 260 Japanese companies employing about 60,000 residents. 
“To some extent, we want to do for the United States what we did for Indiana,” the White House adviser said. 
Indiana is the top U.S. state for per-capita foreign direct investment from Japan, including higher-technology and better-paying manufacturing jobs, said Victor Smith, Pence’s commerce secretary when he led the state. 
The Trump administration wants to attract more foreign direct investment, hoping to lure some with a US$1 trillion plan to rebuild U.S. roads, bridges and other infrastructure. 
Pence will take that message to upcoming stops this week in Jakarta and Sydney. While no immediate announcements are expected from Tokyo, the White House expects a “handful” of investment announcements while Pence is in Australia at the weekend, the adviser said. 
He is due to meet corporate leaders at each of his stops to reassure businesses that trade in the United States is worth their while. 
“Part of the trip is the very big symbolism of listening,” a White House adviser said. “We’re not pivoting away from the region.”

Chef Chai Chun Boon and Zeehan Zahari are the husband-wife team behind Copper. – Pictures by Choo Choy May KUALA LUMPUR, April 16 — With its distinct amber sheen and soft metallic finish, there is no denying that copper is one good-looking metal. It has been around for centuries and used as cookware for as long — and continues to be favoured by chefs — making it traditional yet modern, an enduring classic that speaks of sophistication. But it’s not “elitist” like silver or gold; copper is approachable. 
It is these qualities that inspired Chai Chun Boon and his wife Zeehan Zahari to name their restaurant Copper, which opened in January 2015 at Menara Shell, in the KL Sentral area. Conceived as a chic, casual restaurant where diners can feel at home and yet have a fancy meal and impress guests, the modern European menu reflects Chai’s vast experiences. 
In the 12 or so years since graduating from DCT International Hotel & Business Management School in Switzerland, he has racked up an illustrious résumé cutting his teeth in the kitchens of 2- and 3-Michelin star restaurants in Spain and the Netherlands, and stints in Shanghai and Singapore. 
A delightful yuzu-pepper sauce accompanies the Wild Caught Wildfish (left). A pork-free restaurant, Copper serves alcohol-free wines from Belgium (right) For Copper, Chai doesn’t focus on any particular cuisine but presents a smörgåsbord of European flavours with a strong Mediterranean profile. 
Emphasising freshness, their set lunches are built around the best produce they can source for the day. About 80 per cent of their ingredients, including sauces and breads, are made in-house. 
They make it a point to source locally wherever they can, like the hibiscus that adorns their Valrhona Chocolate Mousse with aerated chocolate, savoury chips, and marinated berries. The edible flowers are from a friend’s conservatory in Ampang. 
Angus Short Ribs with foie gras-sherry potatoes raviolis, white beans and a Parmesan churro Chai also favours the use of a Pira charcoal oven, using it to add flavour and body to everything from appetisers all the way to desserts. Their Pira Spiced Pineapple dessert, served with an Earl Grey granita, salted pineapple, meringue, vanilla espuma and dill is a fine showcase of not only the charcoal oven’s versatility but also Chai’s. 
His forte, Zeehan reveals, is taste. “If he doesn’t make it fine, he makes it taste good!” and when devising a recipe, Chai starts with the flavours, textures, and colours. The presentation is secondary. 
You can see that in appetisers like the bravas, featuring crispy potato wedges, battered jalapeños and onion rings with a spicy Spanish paprika dip. Simple yet highly satisfying, it’s very easy to keep going at it! 
Spätzle, a soft egg noodle, is served with the beef stew Chai prefers not to have any signatures but there is a stand-out dish that has been on the menu from the beginning, and it’s one that the couple themselves like too — the Foie Gras Brûlée. If you love goose liver, this is not to be missed: A silky pâté topped with thin slices of pickled green apples bathed in a balsamic reduction, flavoured with sea salt, and garnished with savoury nuts. 
Break off pieces of the grilled toast that’s served on the side and dip it in, making sure to scoop up a bit of everything. Altogether, it’s a symphony of flavours (umami, savoury, and sweet) and textures (mousse-like, crunchy, and crusty). 
Copper’s menu is not extensive but changes every few months and includes daily specials, so even regulars haven’t had a chance to get bored with their offerings. “We encourage people to share our food, so come in a group of four of more,” Chai offers as a tip. 
The tomato dip in the Salmon Ceviche references the jellies that feature in Laotian cuisine The Valrhona Chocolate Mousse is garnished with edible hibiscus sourced from a conservatory in Ampang “You can order more small plates and fewer mains. That way, you get to try a better variety of our dishes.” 
He also obliges off-menu requests and does a lot of customisation to fit diners’ palates and dietary needs. “Some of our regulars come three to four times a month,” says Zeehan, “and some are on specific diets, like Paleo. We tweak the dishes for them. We’re a small set-up so it’s easy to customise. I think that actually gives us an edge — the fact that we’re always willing to do off-menu items.” 
It also means that Chai and his team get to flex their culinary muscles beyond their usual offerings. Catering is another avenue for them to do that. “We usually do canapés when catering for events, and we try not to repeat the items,” Zeehan shares. “As we get to plan ahead, the team can do even more amazing stuff.” 
You won’t want to stop popping these battered bites into your mouth! The daily specials that do well are eventually incorporated into the menu and the next cycle will see hearty fare like the Pot au Feu, a stew of beef offal served with German spätzle (a soft, short egg noodle), mushrooms, and fried red onions. 
The stew is richly flavoured, its thick sauce cooked to a slightly gelatinous consistency, with different cuts swimming in it — cheeks, brisket, tongue, tendon and tripe among them. 
Another good meaty option is the Angus Short Ribs that are glazed in shallot jus, served with foie gras-sherry potato raviolis over white beans, and a coiled Parmesan churro that lends textural balance to the tender meat. 
Copper Salmon Ceviche was partly inspired by Laotian cuisine On the seafood front, the Wild Caught White Fish poached in oil is a melt-in-the-mouth delight paired with curried cauliflower, semi-frozen marinated grapes, charcoal emulsion, and a yuzu -pepper sauce with herb oil. The grapes are partially frozen to hold their shape and to contrast the hot protein. 
One of Chai’s newest recipes is the Copper Salmon Ceviche, a photogenic dish of salmon cubes in an Asian dressing flavoured with chilli, garlic, lime and gula Melaka, and tiny dollops of tomato dip. It’s refreshing and appetising, a dance of zesty, tangy, spicy flavours across the tongue. 
A week earlier, Chai had collaborated with chef Mark Arunsaphai in the Laos: Beyond Borders event, where they presented an eight-course degustation menu that saw Laotian cuisine being presented on a contemporary platform for the first time. “I was partly inspired by what I came to know of Laotian cuisine,” Chai reveals. “They use jellies as dips, and I’ve incorporated a tomato dip into this dish.” 
The Foie Gras Brûlée has been on their menu from the beginning Such creative get-togethers with other chefs is what stokes Chai’s fire. He will be collaborating with Table & Apron for a special menu slated for end of April, and hopes to work with a mixologist next. “We don’t serve wine at Copper, so it will be a challenge for the mixologist!” Chai says with a laugh. 
Currently, they serve the Vintense range of non-alcoholic wines from Belgium and an interesting variety of mocktails (try the Wicked Ginger for a lovely punch of heat with a refreshing citrus base). 
Since opening in 2015, Copper’s popularity has grown through word of mouth Chai and Zeehan are also hoping to build an indoor garden at their restaurant, and already have a space set aside for it but are having trouble sourcing the right expertise for it. Their vision is motivated by the Royal Mail Hotel in Grampians, about four hours from Melbourne, which has an organic kitchen garden that grew what Chai considers “the best vegetables.” 
He recalls carrots of all shapes and sizes that you can pluck right out of the ground but as soon as you did, they start to lose flavour. Having a similar set-up is “a very faraway dream” but an indoor vegetable and herb garden might be more achievable. 
In the meantime, his focus is on constantly improving what Copper has to offer. His experiences around Asia and Europe has put him in good stead where culinary repertoire is concerned, but running his own restaurant has been a steep learning curve for both him and Zeehan. 
Copper was conceived as a casual restaurant where diners could feel comfortable yet have a fancy meal “Just because I have experience doesn’t mean that I am right or that everyone will like what I like. Malaysians have very tricky palates... our Chinese customers are particularly discerning,” Chai reveals, “so they’re my benchmark: If we can please them, we can please most people!” 
Perfection, he says, is a goal but not a reality. Judging from the number of repeat customers and glowing reviews, Copper is as close to perfection as it gets where Kuala Lumpur’s European cuisine scene is concerned.

We'll let a lot of stuff slide to get the same feel, bum notes, bits that are just plain wrong, new bits or new songs with minimal takes to get a feel of almost falling apart. Because that's what it's like for us playing live. Just on the edge of falling apart. We try and get tight, but it's just not in us as a band. by Chad Murray | April 15, 2017 | Interviews 
Ahead of the release of their stupendous new album IV ( reviewed here ) and their performance at Wrong Festival in Liverpool on the 22nd April, Chad Murray asked Part Chimp the big questions such as first and foremost, “cheese toastie or bean breville?” 
PC: Cheese and beans for ultimate scald factor. 
(((o))): The first thing I’d like to ask about the new is whether the album is intended to be referred to as four or “I.V” or even in vitro or something like chicken wings? 
PC: Iv, rhymes with div 
(((o))): Ok, so, I get you might not be able to explicitly answer this but exactly what part of you is chimp exactly? 
PC: You are right, I am not able to answer that question. 
(((o))): *Jake Murray also asks* “Part Chimp… Part Biscuit?” 
PC: No. 
(((o))): All the easy stuff aside, what exactly is it that you, as a band, feel helps to elevate your live sound from the studio? Especially, as you are frequently championed by people who’s opinion I trust as a fucking incredible band to behold in person. 
PC: A natural looseness that comes with the characters in the band. We try to get that factor onto the records but it’s sometimes difficult in the studio. We’ll let a lot of stuff slide to get the same feel, bum notes, bits that are just plain wrong, new bits or new songs with minimal takes to get a feel of almost falling apart. Because that’s what it’s like for us playing live. Just on the edge of falling apart. We try and get tight, but it’s just not in us as a band. 
(((o))): The big question on a lot of people’s minds seems to be what the fuck is gonna happen when Part Chimp storm Merseyside and swarm the stage for Wrong Festival, the first half of the true Merseyside derby? 
PC: I’m not sure that’s really the big question on a lot of people’s minds, unless you know something we don’t. Is it a trap? Have you rigged up some kind of Carrie-esque blood bath over the stage or something? What the fuck IS going to happen??! We just don’t know. 
(((o))): I won’t say too much but, bring wellies and a hook-hand. 
(((o))): I believe the next time I’ll be seeing you after that will be at the 100 Club with Baba Yaga, can you tell us about your history with Baba Yaga and your overall experience with the promotion? Personally, I feel like Baba Yaga is where live music is at as far as London is concerned, though, I obviously love Goodsoul Promotions and Chaos Theory as well but, I guess there’s some bias there. 
PC: I think it started at The Corsica Studios, which is a really great venue in South London. Adrian has been putting on great shows there for ever. And then one day it was Anthony booking us to play there and there was Baba Yaga’s Hut putting on lots of good shows. Which was cool. I’m not really clued in to the scene but it seems pretty good. Usually, if there’s an interesting show going on, it turns out it’s one of theirs. 
(((o))): I feel the same, recently moving to London it seems that there’s just a constant torrent of great gigs being put on by them. I also see that you’ve released a beautiful new t-shirt, what other merch might one be able to purchase whilst you’re on tour? 
PC: Yes. Along with the classic Beardface shirt, now in a beautiful 3 colour print! there is a hand screen printed design from a bloke called Lada in Hungary who has done some great shirts for a few bands in the past so I thought it was about time he did one for us. It’s got a slug on it and the Eye-sparagus from the cover of the record. It’s lovely. You will also be able to get the new album on white vinyl and anything else we can dig up. We also have copies of the 7? split with Grey Hairs we did for God Unknown. 
(((o))): …And coming round somewhat palindromically or in some sort of paraprosdokian, how did you get that drum sound on your album? It’s fucking colossal. To be honest, at Echoes and Dust HQ, that was fuck loads of people asking how you got various sounds on your album; so, I guess if you guys could tell us about the recording process and what weird and wonderful shit went into that, I think that’d appeal to all of those curiosities? 
PC: We recorded in a barn in the middle of nowhere in Norfolk in February. It was really cold. Apparently it’s the cold that helps the sound waves travel through the air in a truer waveform and also microphone membranes perform better in low temperatures. This was all engineered by our engineer, Hieronymus, a dutchman born in the same town as Hieronymus Bosch, so what you are also hearing is traces of the mindset of the painter of the Garden Of Earthly Delights etc. 
(((o))): Well, I believe it was The Dude who said: “that’s fucking interesting man, that’s fucking interesting”. Kind of reminds me of something from Sylvia Massy’s Recording Unhinged. I dunno, the science of it myself but I imagine beers staying cold for longer also helped you guys to create the resulting Facemelter that we are all know and love here at Echoes and Dust. 
Last but not least, who would win in a collision one trillion lions or The Sun? (*the source of life; not the source of bogus “news”) 
PC: The person who managed to get one trillion lions into space.

Thanks to Part Chimp for taking part in this interview, they will be playing Wrong Festival and the 100 Club on the aforementioned dates and IV was released last Friday 14th April ; get it down your fucking gullet. It’s magnificent.

He’s known only as Wren. A wealthy, dangerously secretive man, he specializes in making problems disappear. A professional fixer, Wren hides a dark past, but his privacy is shattered when Emery Finn seeks him out—and what she wants from him is very personal. 

Some people disappear against their will. Emery’s job is to find them and bring closure. Wren is the only person who can help solve Emery’s own personal mystery: the long-ago disappearance of her cousin. Just tracking down the sexy, brooding Wren is difficult enough. Resisting her body’s response to him will prove completely impossible.

Anonymity is essential to Wren’s success, yet drawn by Emery’s loyalty and sensuality, he’s pulled out of the shadows. But her digging is getting noticed by the wrong people. And as the clues start to point to someone terrifyingly close, Wren will have to put his haunted past aside to protect the woman he loves.



I feel like I'm a bit weird, but it is rare for me to marathon a series, especially romantic suspense. I will most likely do a blog post about this, but it all stems from a series that I read in the past and it left me in a fog of ""what the heck just happened?"" Ever since, there's never been a series that has made me want to devour all the books in record time. Why am I saying this? Well, that flew out the window when I finished The Fixer . The minute I put it down, I immediately wanted the next book. In fact, if all of the books were out, I would have spent the week reading the entire series. That is how much I flipping loved this book. I wanted to forget all my hang-ups about marathons and hibernate until I finished them. It's a good thing there is a bit of a wait or my family would have to send out a search and rescue team. Oh, can I request Wren? He can find me any day of the week and twice on Sunday... 
Okay, I fear that I've gone way off point now... 
I am a relatively new-ish fan of HelenKay Dimon, but she's been on my ""need to read"" list for sometime now. After finishing The Fixer , she's now an auto-buy for me and a new favorite romantic suspense author. HelenKay's writing style is phenomenal. I loved the mixture of intensity and lighthearted moments. I love that Wren is a whole bag of goodness. He's sexy, but adorably clueless. He's total alpha with a bit of awkwardness, especially when it comes to Emery. I loved that he's all take charge, but knows Emery could easily kick his ass if he ticks her off. Emery is tenacious. She's determined to find the truth about her cousin and will go to the end of the Earth to get justice. She will go toe-to-toe with anyone that dares step in her way. You'd think these two characters would butt-heads, right? They do, but in the sexiest way. Three words... Suit. Strip. Scene. Two more words... Hell. Yes! I can go on about what I loved with The Fixer , but trust me, if you are a fan of romantic suspense books that make you laugh and swoon while keeping you guessing, then you will love this book.  

HelenKay Dimon is a divorce lawyer-turned-romance author. After dedicating years to helping people terminate relationships she now writes romance novels full time. Her books have earned praise, appeared on bestseller lists, won numerous awards and twice been named Red-Hot Reads and excerpted in Cosmo. She sometimes writes erotic romance, sometimes writes romantic suspense and sometimes writes contemporary romance. But no matter what she's writing her books are always filled with smart banter and sexy times, and a HEA is guaranteed.

It was announced today that the Centre of Unique Business Evolution (CUBE) has launched a Business Mentoring initiative for the Upper Clutha community. The free initiative is open to all start-ups and businesses and the CUBE will match participants with experienced business people that can act as a sounding board for people’s ideas. 
Jason Watkins, Business Development Manager of the CUBE says “this business mentoring initiative has been in the making for some months and I have been absolutely blown away by the level of interest shown by potential mentors once they had heard about our plan to offer business mentoring for our community”. There are almost 20 mentors in the pool that Jason has assembled and they come with a broad range of experience and expertise in business. Jason commented “we have always thought that Wanaka was a place that talent comes to live and the mentor pool is a reflection of this and we are very lucky to have so many exceptional business people volunteering their time to become mentors”. 
People wanting to be considered to have a business mentor are asked to register their interest online via the CUBE website ( www.cubewanaka.co.nz ). Applicants circumstances and requirements will be reviewed and assuming there is a suitable mentor available at the time, a match is found. Jason says “this mentor initiative has a high degree of flexibility for both parties (the mentee and the mentor) and this will hopefully ensure we get the best matches possible and that the mentoring engagement benefits are maximised”. 
Jason encouraged anyone involved in a start-up or trading business to visit the CUBE website and see if having a mentor could help them with their business endeavours. “From my experience, many people in business I meet, often talk about how it would be great to run their ideas past someone who is independent and unbiased (not necessarily family and friends) and this is where the real value of mentoring lies”. 
The CUBE is excited to develop this latest initiative in support of the local business community and believe it is a fantastic addition to it’s current offerings. Jason commented “it’s a fundamental objective of the CUBE to assist in the capability development of the business community and we do this by offering business support initiatives. We know that the development of capability within local businesses is a long-term undertaking. However, the development we see from people and businesses through our other initiatives like the Cell and Co.Starters tells us people are actively seeking help and are appreciative of the support the CUBE provides”.

In the wake of last week, the weather looking ahead is a lot closer to ""normal"" for New Zealand autumn. A low to the west of Taranaki is expected to track east tomorrow, bringing showers and possible hail for a time to some North Island and northern South Island areas. Further south a cold front and southerlies bring cloud and scattered rain to the east coast today before breaking to fine tomorrow, though a few showers linger in the south as another, weaker cold front moves northward. 
The first half of April has been a wet one with two major systems crossing New Zealand. The remnants of Cyclone Debbie affected a widespread area of the North Island early this month and the latest combination of a slow moving low in the Tasman sea with the short sharp hit from Cyclone Cook has led to above average rainfall for a lot of regions. 
A quick look at the cumulative rainfall, most areas north of Bay of Plenty along the east coast have received over double their monthly averages. Whakatane has recorded 267mm of rain so far this month (average rainfall for the whole of the month of April is 117mm) and Whitianga 338mm (April average is 168mm) which are both the highest on record for the month of April since 1991. This last week the South Island didn’t get off ‘scot free’ either with Nelson getting an unusual 153mm already this month (about triple their April average). More can be found on the week that was and the impacts of Cyclone Cook on our blog http://info.metraweather.com/e/60812/CycloneCookSummary/cpjlvd/526802411. 
It does look as if a more regular weather pattern of predominating westerlies will be the recipe for the later part of April as Georgina Griffiths predicted in our rural monthly outlook (available at http://info.metraweather.com/e/60812/MonthlyOutlook/cpjltn/526802411). ""Though showers are expected for those hard hit areas of Bay of Plenty over the next couple of days, with isolated thunderstorms possible, a ridge pushing onto the country on Tuesday marks a more settled weather pattern for the area and generally the country"" said April Clark, meteorologist at Metservice.

Aged Care Provider Enliven Says Pay Equity a Game Changer 
Aged-care service provider, Enliven, is welcoming the recently announced pay increase for care and support workers. 
Part of the not-for-profit organisation Presbyterian Support, Enliven provides a wide range of aged-care services across New Zealand. 
Enliven’s national spokesperson, Gillian Bremner, says the organisation’s pay rates are based on the funding they receive from the Government, “so this is great news for our staff”. 
“We value our employees and want to see them receive fair remuneration for the training they undertake, and the essential work they do to support the elderly. We also firmly believe gender should not affect what people get paid, and we support this step by the Government to address that gender pay gap.” 
Mrs. Bremner says Enliven will be closely reviewing the detail around this landmark decision by the Government, and the suggested sustainability and implementation plans. 
“We see this is as an important step forward for our sector, and the people who are delivering these essential services.”

Wasim Akram, in an unexpected but well thought move, was appointed as honorary CEO of Careem . During his appointment — which lasted for a single day — he had the power to issue one executive order, and as you might have guessed it, he reduced Careem fares for Lahore and Karachi. 
Fare Reductions: 25% in Lahore on Go Rides 20% in Karachi for Go Rides 
The former Pakistani cricketer and left-arm fast bowler Wasim Akram was announced as Careem’s new honorary CEO. Post retirement, much like many former cricketers, Akram became a prominent commentator. He then took up the role of coach of Indian Premier League (IPL) side Kolkata Knight Riders and has helped them to be crowned champions in 2012 and 2014. 
In view of this change, MD Careem, Junaid Iqbal stated: 
I am excited to announce Wasim Akram as our Honorary CEO of Careem Pakistan. He is the perfect cultural fit for Careem. And there is no one more qualified than the Sultan of Swing, Wasim Akram to head Careem Pakistan. I am proud to pass the torch to him and I have full confidence that he will bring out the best in our employees, Captains and Customers. 
After being instated as the CEO, Wasim Akram asked both Captains and customers to share one change they would like him to make to Careem given his new authority. 
Since the announcement, Wasim has looked over comments, experiences and reviews and as a result has decided to complement this change in Careem’s structure with a change in prices. 
As honorary CEO, Wasim Akram has made an executive order to cut prices in Lahore and Karachi. This price cut is only for GO cars where 25% price cut has been applied in Lahore and 20% in Karachi. The drop in prices is significant as fares in Lahore (for instance) can go as low as PKR 100.

CALGARY – It was a laugher that turned into a crier. Now, the Calgary Flames are one defeat from being swept out of the playoffs. 
Corey Perry capped a crazy Anaheim Ducks comeback 1:30 into overtime at the Scotiabank Saddledome on Monday night when his centering attempt banked off a couple Flames and wound up in the net for a 5-4 Ducks triumph. It was a stunning final blow in a game that saw Anaheim crawl out of a 4-1 deficit to snatch victory. 
Now, thanks in large part to two goals from defenceman Shea Theodore and a three-point night by grinder Nate Thompson, the Pacific Division champs are one win from advancing thanks to a 3-0 series lead. 
“A 4-1 game, you gotta close that out,” said Flames captain Mark Giordano . “There’s no excuses.” 
There are, of course, reasons when something like this happens and there’s no hiding from the reality that goalie Brian Elliott had a large hand in Calgary’s undoing. 
The Flames appeared to be cruising near the end of the second period, riding power-play goals from Sean Monahan , Kris Versteeg and Sam Bennett , as well as an even-strength marker by Michael Stone to a three-goal cushion that prompted Anaheim coach Randy Carlyle to yank John Gibson in favour of Jonathan Bernier . The shots after 40 minutes were 24-14 in favour of the Flames, but one of the Ducks’ last attempts – a sharp-angle floater from Theodore – eluded the glove of Elliott. 
In a sombre Flames room, the goalie shouldered much of the blame. 
“That’s not an easy one, especially personally,” he said. “I didn’t feel I played very well and I let the team down a little bit. 
“I have to own that. It’s not an easy thing to do. The guys spotted four goals, we should win a game like that.” 
While Calgary was still in prime position to do so after 40, there’s no doubt Anaheim sprung to life after the goal. In fact, the Ducks nearly made it 4-3 in the dying seconds of the middle frame when Jakob Silfverberg rang one off the post. 
“We couldn’t seem to make two passes together for the better part the first two periods,” said Carlyle. “We got a goal that gave us some life and made us believe that we have a chance.” 
Based on past precedent, that should not have been the case. Calgary was lights out when it came to closing games in the regular season, posting a league best .971 points percentage in contests it led after two periods. 
And for 10 minutes of the third, there was no further indication of an Anaheim threat until Thompson – who was bumped up from the fourth line to the third during the game – tipped home a point shot with a stick video review confirmed was under the league’s legal height limit. 
Then, with fewer than five minutes remaining, a point shot from Theodore nicked off Bennett and found the net for the equalizer. By that point, the ‘C of Red’ was full of white knuckles as the home team crumpled. 
“We didn’t have enough push or drive,” said Giordano. “We allowed them to come and a few shots from the point went in. We sort of shelled up a little bit.” 
The “what if” game will surely be played well into the night in Calgary. Both Monahan and Troy Brouwer had tap-in misses in the second period that inspired face palms and there’s no denying Anaheim continues to be on the right end of some fortuitous breaks. 
Game 2 was decided on a puck that caromed off Lance Bouma ’s skate in the high slot and somehow found the net; for most of the time it took to review Thompson’s deflection, Twitter was rife with non-partisans saying the goal would come back; Perry’s overtime winner kicked off Elliott’s stick, plunked Stone in the back of the leg while he battled Thompson on the lip of the crease and went into the net.

A pity party, however, is not something Stone wants any part of. 
“I think those bounces are caused by different things that happen before it gets to that point,” he said. 
Even after all that, redemption seemed at hand for a precious moment in overtime when Johhny Gaudreau slipped behind the Anaheim defence. 
“We had a chance there with Johnny,” said Calgary coach Glen Gulutzan. “We were a foot away from springing him on a break.” 
The pass, though, went just past the outstretched stick of the Flames sniper and, only seconds later, the game was over. 
And if Calgary can’t solve its problems quick, the series soon will be, too.

Pence first joined a working lunch with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe before meeting Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso for economic talks. 
U.S. President Donald Trump and Abe arranged the talks between their deputies at a Washington summit in February, soon after Trump took office. 
""When President Trump agreed to this dialogue, he envisioned this as a mechanism for enhancing bilateral commercial relations between the United States and Japan, and achieving results in the near future. And I share that vision and impatience,"" Pence told Aso at the start of the talks, comments that could be construed as a warning to Tokyo not to use the dialogue to kick touchy topics down the road. 
Aso in turn said U.S.-Japan trade friction, which soured ties in the 1980s and 1990s, was a thing of the distant past and the allies were now entering an era of cooperation. 
In a statement after the talks, the two sides said they had agreed the dialogue should produce ""concrete results in the near term"" adding that they had ""discussed specific sectors where improved commercial relations will promote mutual economic benefits and job creation in both countries"". 
Earlier, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met Japan's trade minister, Hiroshige Seko. Ross, seen as more hardline on trade, told reporters Washington was eager to increase trade ties with Tokyo through a two-way agreement. 
Pence landed in Tokyo from South Korea after a trip that included a visit to the heavily fortified border separating the North and South. He described the U.S.-Japan alliance as the ""cornerstone"" of regional security. 
Pence's 10-day tour of Asia is aimed at emphasising that U.S. President Donald Trump wants to boost U.S. trade in the region even though Trump has abandoned the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact. 
Advocates for the TPP, negotiated by former President Barack Obama and supported by Abe, said it would have opened markets for American exports. U.S. business groups supported the deal but U.S. labour unions argued it would hurt American workers. 
Trump campaigned for office on an ""America First"" platform, saying he would boost U.S. manufacturing jobs and shrink the country's trade deficit with countries like Japan. 
Trump also vowed to renegotiate existing regional trade deals to focus on bilateral agreements. Tokyo is wary of a two-way free trade agreement (FTA), fearing it would boost pressure to open up politically sensitive sectors such as agriculture. 
""It's a little bit early to say just what forms things will take but we are certainly eager to increase our trade relationships with Japan and to do so in the form of an agreement,"" Ross said when asked about a possible FTA. 
TRADE IMBALANCES 
Japan had a $69 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, the U.S. Treasury Department said, expressing concern over what it called the ""persistence"" of the imbalance. 
Japanese officials counter that Tokyo accounts for a much smaller chunk of America's deficit than in the past, while China's imbalance is much bigger. 
Trump has complained that Japan keeps its currency artificially low, although a Treasury Department report last week did not label Japan a currency manipulator. The issue was not expected to be raised in talks on Tuesday. 
Pence said in Seoul earlier on Tuesday the Trump administration would review and reform a 5-year-old free trade agreement with South Korea. 
The Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association expressed concern about any review of the pact, which removed tariffs on auto trade between the two countries. 
Trump and Abe agreed in February to have Pence and Aso, who is also Japan's finance minister, open an economic dialogue. 
The two sides were expected to agree on principles and a process for further detailed discussions between ministries. 
""Obviously, the first high-level talk is not going to have an immediate resolution of anything but I think we have a reasonable path forward,"" Ross said. 
Aso told reporters before the talks he would not discuss any bilateral free trade deal with Pence. The White House adviser said Tuesday's talks would not prescribe a free-trade deal but talks might eventually lead to such negotiations. 
Pence developed ties with Japanese business and political leaders as governor of Indiana, a state that is home to Subaru, Honda and Toyota plants, and about 260 Japanese companies employing about 60,000 residents. 
""To some extent, we want to do for the United States what we did for Indiana,"" the White House adviser said. 
The Trump administration wants to attract more foreign direct investment, hoping to lure some with a $1 trillion plan to rebuild U.S. roads, bridges and other infrastructure. 
Pence will take that message to upcoming stops this week in Jakarta and Sydney. While no immediate announcements are expected from Tokyo, the White House expects a ""handful"" of investment announcements while Pence is in Australia at the weekend, the adviser said. 
He is due to meet corporate leaders at each of his stops.

Beset with the problem of surplus power, the Punjab Government is all set to approach the Centre seeking permission to export power to Pakistan and Nepal. Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who will meet senior officials of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) soon to review the power scenario, will write to PM Narendra Modi on the issue, it is learnt. (Follow The Tribune on Facebook ; and Twitter @thetribunechd ) Power consumers in the state will have to bear a burden of about Rs 2,750 crore (around 70 paise per unit) this fiscal due to non-utilisation of the fixed quota of power being generated by private sector thermal plants in the state. At the time of setting up such plants, the state entered into agreements with private players that it would pay fixed charges in case its power customers did not utilise the fixed quota of power generated at these plants. In fact, the burden has to be ultimately borne by power consumers in the state. With the setting up of three thermal plants in the private sector in recent years, there has been an addition of 3,950 MW in power generation against the requirement of 1,400-1,500 MW. “PSPCL has to pay fixed charges to these private plants for not utilising the minimal fixed quota of power generated,” said Padamjit Singh, former PSPCL Chief Engineer. During a visit to Pakistan, a representative of a leading corporate house negotiated to supply 4,000 MW to Pakistan from Gujarat. The power deficit in Pakistan is in the range of 35%. China has also offered to export power to it. Sources said if the deal materialised, the authorities would have to first synchronise the power transporting system of the two countries to match power frequency. The Pakistan power generation and supply system (based on American system) functions on a different frequency than the Indian power system, which follows the British pattern. It would take at least one year to set up high voltage direct current back-to-back module at the 400 KV grid, near Amritsar, to synchronise the supply systems of the two countries. The financial viability will also have to be examined. The average power generation cost in Punjab is around Rs 4.50 per unit. The power rates (in Indian currency) in Pakistan at the consumer end is said to be Rs 7-8 per unit.","Capt for export of power to Pak, Nepal, seeks approval",http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_6t5KmapPf.DpRc7O053XOA6LFL40UnSGkd9dSC9AU_4_pBSmgSpFKz9hwLae9WZkJd6GoGfx5lU5r4sboWpGTW6kYwy8rE_Qx2FDOXjx2NEzjrG_GzzScdOjS0VLsqDQh1G8Yk6VS7w--,d547c399de114e2fd5e0a4ae55a7828b7248610a,www.tribuneindia.com,http://www.tribuneindia.com/images/default_image.gif,http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/uttarakhand/,The Tribune: Uttarakhand news ,SG,14236.0,0,tribuneindia.com,1,"Capt for export of power to Pak, Nepal, seeks approval",0.0,news,0,"[{'sentiment': 'negative', 'name': 'pak'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'narendra modi'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'capt amarinder singh'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'padamjit singh'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'chandigarh'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'nepal'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'punjab government'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'pakistan'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'gujarat'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'china'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'amritsar'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'punjab'}]","[{'sentiment': 'negative', 'name': 'sarbjit dhaliwal tribune news service'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'pspcl'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'punjab state power corporation limited'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'tribune'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'facebook'}]"

SYDNEY: Australia will abolish a temporary work visa popular with foreigners and replace it with a new program requiring better English-language and job skills, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Tuesday. 
Turnbull, struggling with poor voter approval ratings, rejected suggestions the visa policy change was in response to far-right wing political parties, such as One Nation demanding more nationalistic policies. 
But in a Facebook announcement Turnbull said: ""Our reforms will have a simple focus: Australian jobs and Australian values."" 
Turnbull said the visa change would attract better skilled workers and see Australians employed over cheap foreign workers brought in under the old 457 visa program. 
""We are an immigration nation, but the fact remains- Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs,"" he said. ""We'll no longer allow 457 visas to be passports to jobs that could and should go to Australians."" 
The 457 visa was introduced in the 1990s to expedite the entry of business professionals and highly skilled migrants but over time it was opened up to include a broad suite of workers. 
The program has become mired in controversy with allegations the visa was being misused by employers to import workers on the cheap, not to fill genuine skill shortage. 
""We are bringing the 457 visa class to an end. It's lost its credibility,"" Turnbull said at a press conference in Canberra. 
Anyone now in Australia on a 457 visa will not be affected by the new arrangements. 
The 457 visa, now used by about 95,000 foreign workers, will be replaced by a new temporary visa and the list of occupations that qualify for a visa will be reduced from more than 200. 
The new visa will be limited to a two-year period and a second four-year visa will require a higher standard of English language. From 1901 to around 1973, Australia restricted non-white immigration under a White Australia policy which required an English language test. 
The Australian Industry Group (Ai Group), which represents more than 60,000 business, said the changes would improve the integrity of Australia's visa program. 
""The temporary skilled visa program should now be considered as settled without the need for further reviews and disruptive policy change,"" said Ai Group Chief Executive Innes Willox. 
Some experts said the government should focus on boosting education and training systems to address Australia's skills needs. 
The opposition was not impressed though. Labor leader Bill Shorten tweeted ""the only job Malcolm Turnbull cares about saving is his own."" 0 0 Australia toughens foreign worker visas, says Australian jobs for Australians was posted in world of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on April 18, 2017 and was last updated on April 18, 2017.

Japan and the U.S. have outlined a path forward for economic talks between the countries. 
The announcement followed an inaugural meeting Tuesday of the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue in Tokyo chaired by visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso. 
It said the dialogue would focus on three areas: trade and investment rules and issues, cooperation in macroeconomic policy and specific industry sectors.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso are kicking off a new U.S.-Japan economic dialogue that was launched during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's meeting with President Donald Trump in the U.S. in February. 
As talks began Tuesday, Aso said the U.S.-Japan alliance has underpinned peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and that trade friction with the U.S. has given way to an ""age of cooperation."" 
Pence said Trump sees the talks as a way to improve business ties with Japan and is hoping for quick results. The discussions are to focus on economic and structural policy and trade and investment strategies aimed at strengthening both countries' economies.

2:15 p.m. 
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese leaders have begun talks expected to focus largely on trade with America's anchor ally in the region, though tensions with North Korea loomed large. 
Pence reassured Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday that the U.S. considers its alliance with Japan to be a cornerstone of security in the region. 
Pence said, ""We appreciate the challenging times in which the people of Japan live with increasing provocations from across the Sea of Japan."" 
He also said, ""We are with you 100 percent,"" adding that the U.S. always seeks peace. 
Abe said Japan hoped for peaceful dialogue with Pyongyang, ""but at the same time, dialogue for the sake of dialogue is valueless and it is necessary for us to exercise pressure North Korea so that it comes forward and engages in this serious dialogue.""

Got my hands on 3 KL minifigs! The others from the same set weren't available yet in my local store. 

From left to right, it's Karnak from the Inhumans, Phoenix Five Colossus from the Mutants/X-Men, and of course the Inhuman queen: Medusa, who will be our focus for this post! 

KL printing is quite good. Not wow, but also not bad. In the same level as POGO or XINH or KF or WM.  

The plastic quality on the other hand is a different story. Look closely at the hairpiece, there's a bit of orange plastic on top. Easily cuttable but still.  

If you look closely at the hair piece again, there's some sort of scratch with white plastic marks on it and it's such a deal breaker. Same goes for the left arm where there's a line of white plastic as if it just got removed from its runner..  

Before anything, take a look at the painted legs. Not dual molded. Printing could've gone better. DLP for me is still the king of leg prints haha.  

Better view of the legs. Black on white floor.  

Side view without the hair. Simple.  

This is the back face. For my minifig though, the head is so hard to remove/move and until now I haven't moved it. Fortunately the face I prefer is the one on default haha.  
KL brand is a welcome addition to our minifig makers! It just sucks that my Medusa is a bad one. I honestly think that the bad plastic on my Medusa was an isolated case  because my Karnak and Colossus from KL too are just as good as POGO/XINH.  
I'll add in reviews of Colossus and Karnak soon! Then maybe their whole set when I complete them!  And of course, WELCOM KL BRAND!

Cheek by Jowl’s modern-dress production , directed by Declan Donnellan and designed by Nick Ormerod, doesn’t get over all the difficulties. Despite a beguiling comic performance by Ryan Donaldson as Autolycus, the pastoral scenes are wasted in a welter of updating: the whole thing is turned into a lurid TV chat show. Yet elsewhere are shafts of that wonderful illumination this company habitually throws on Shakespeare – literally so, in the case of Judith Greenwood’s dramatic lighting.

The jealousy scenes are animated by unusual febrility. Orlando James’s Leontes is from the beginning strained, given to sudden hugs and sudden withdrawals, walking away. When the verdict of the Oracle, denouncing him, is read out, he bursts into hysterical laughter. The sheer number of reactions is greater than usual and helps to stretch the action, making his jealousy look more intricate. It also looks like a family failing. Tom Cawte makes the often weedy part of Mamillius into something riveting. Cawte, who is 20 and went into the company without drama school training, makes himself look like a tantruming infant. His energy is unstable: thwarted in anything, he wails, flings himself to the ground. He is a terrifying mini-Leontes.

The coming to life of Hermione’s statue is wonderfully framed, with Natalie Radmall-Quirke seated, draped like a Sargent painting – though too low down for the instruction for her to “descend” to make sense. Radmall-Quirke is a mellifluous but marmoreal Hermione. Up to this point, the interpretation looked limited: now her qualities come into their own.
Sadly the bear is a washout. In Ormerod’s stripped-back staging, most of the action takes place in front of a large wooden crate over which videos speed. The rampaging creature is disappointingly virtual: no furry beast shambling in, just a blurry image played on those crates, towards which his supper (a court servant) seems to run. Why should the dare of this comic death be dodged when the poignant rebirth is not?

Due to its success as a rehabilitation program for prisoners, the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) is planning to adopt for implementation in Iwahig Penal Colony in Palawan, its Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) with Tagum Development Corporation (Tadeco). The JVA involves about 5,300 hectares of the Davao Penal Colony (Dapecol) in Sto. Tomas town in Davao del Norte that Tadeco developed into a banana plantation. The 25-year deal is primarily aimed at the rehabilitation of the inmates with Tadeco hiring out Dapecol prisoners as farm hands paid with minimum wage. “This rehabilitation program has been found to be very successful by BuCor, to the extent that the latter has even requested Tadeco to replicate the JVA program to its penal colony in Iwahig, Palawan,” said Tadeco in a statement. In response to the BuCor request, in a report in BusinessMirror, Alexander N. Valoria, president and CEO of the Antonio O. Floirendo Management and Investment Corp. (Anflocor), said Tadeco has sent two missions to look into the situation in Iwahig. Tadeco is yet to propose its recommendations to start the project, said Valoria as a resolution was filed in the House of Representatives questioning the Tadeco-BuCor JVA. House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez has filed House Resolution 867 to investigate the allegedly “grossly disadvantageous” 25-year “lease contract” signed by BuCor and Tadeco. Reports say that Alvarez’s motive in filing the resolution was his ongoing spat with Rep. Antonio Floirendo, Jr., top honcho of the Tadeco banana empire. READ MORE PANTALEON ALVAREZ In separate statements, Tadeco and Valoria disputed Alvarez’s claim, saying the Tadeco-BuCor deal, a JVA and not a lease contract, is “legal and advantageous to the government.” The JVA was first signed in 1956 and was last reviewed by Congress in 2012. “The JVA has been reviewed, and found to be advantageous to the government numerous times by the Executive and the Legislative departments in past administrations,” Tadeco said. Tadeco adds that “the most recent review in the 15th Congress in 2012 once again arrived at the same positive conclusion regarding the JVA and its benefits to the government.” Even the “Department of Justice said during the congressional review that the JVA is above board,” Tadeco in its statement further added. For his part, Valoria, in the report in BusinessMirror, said that even former President Benigno S. Aquino III, who was a senator then, “sat at the Blue Ribbon Committee reviewing this agreement.” The bottom line of the JVA, according to Valoria, is “to help the government in providing a good correctional and rehabilitation program for convicts.” Explaining the ground level mechanics of the JVA, Valoria said “prisoners of good standing” are chosen by Dapecol to work in the banana plantation. Valoria said BuCor deploys every day in the Tadeco banana farm about 600 prisoners from its pool of 900 prisoner workers, “as part of the rehabilitation of the prisoners” under the JVA.

A war widow alone… Ellie Meeks promised her pilot husband that if anything happened to him, she would live her life to the fullest. Three years later, she is still alone, raising the twins he never met. She has no interest in dating or meeting men—until one snowy night when a stranger helps her get her sick kids safely home. That stranger turns out to be a former Army Ranger and a member of the elite Rocky Mountain Search & Rescue Team. He’s also tall, rugged… and irresistibly sexy. All it takes is one kiss… Jesse Moretti came to Colorado to get Iraq out of his head, using the adrenaline of extreme sports and high-risk mountain rescues to keep his mind off the past. But getting involved with Ellie might be the riskiest thing he’s ever done. It’s not just their explosive chemistry. There’s something about Ellie that gets inside him, opening him to feelings he’s tried hard to ignore. When passion ignites… Ellie feels alive in Jesse’s arms and happier than she ever thought she’d feel again. But their relationship comes at a price for him, and soon Ellie sees that she must help Jesse fight the demons of his past to protect the love of a lifetime—and save the heart of a hero.

4.5 Stars 

Falling Hard is the third title in the Colorado High Country series, but can easily be read as a standalone.   Although this was my first time reading anything written by Pamela Clare, it will not be my last.  

The story line is well written and well paced.  I was captivated by Ellie and Jesse's story right from the very first chapter.  Both characters are incredibly endearing.  Ellie is a strong, intelligent, hard working, kind, compassionate and caring.  She's an amazing single mother to her precocious and adorable twins Daisy and Daniel.  

Jesse is a protective, sexy, heroic, and sweet hero with a huge heart.  A slightly damaged alpha who is a caretaker underneath his tough guy exterior.  


This is a story of loss, second chances, and finding love again.  It a sweet and steamy blend with moving and emotional heartfelt moments.  Both heartbreaking and heartwarming, you will need the tissues close by.  The emotions felt very realistic and I was enthralled with their story.  

I thoroughly enjoyed watching their relationship develop.  I thoroughly recommend Falling Hard to anyone who enjoys a slow burn, contemporary romance with insta-lust. I look forward to reading more of Pamela Clare's work in the future.  






Barely Breathing  
(Colorado High Country #1) 

Lexi Jewell left Scarlet Springs twelve years ago, vowing never to return to the eccentric Colorado mountain town where she grew up. Now, here she is—over thirty, out of a job and with little choice but to move back in with her father. Lexi knows it’s just a matter of time before she runs into Austin Taylor, her first boyfriend and her first heartbreak. She’s determined to show him she’s over him—until he steps out of a pickup truck and back into her life, looking sexy as hell in his mountain ranger uniform. As far as Austin is concerned, Lexi can turn her snazzy little convertible around and drive back to Chicago. After all, she ripped his teenage heart apart and turned her back on the town he loves. But from the moment he sees her again, he can’t get her out of his mind. Even her smile messes with his head.  When an evening of conversation turns into something else, Lexi and Austin agree to be friends again—with benefits. But as Lexi starts making plans to return to the big city, Austin realizes he’ll lose her a second time unless he can show her that what she’s searching for has been right here all along. Note to readers: This is straight contemporary romance, not romantic suspense.

Slow Burn  
(Colorado High Country #2) 

V ictoria Woodley is done with men. Fresh off a dating nightmare, she flies from her home in Chicago to Scarlet Springs to take part in her best friend’s wedding. Who picks her up at the airport? Eric Hawke. Of course. She made a fool of herself over him last time she was here. He’s cocky, charming, and sexy as sin. But the fact that she’s attracted to him is all the proof she needs that he’s bad news. She would ignore him if she could. But he’s the best man, and she’s the maid of honor. She can’t just tell him to jump in a lake—especially not when her lips are locked with his. 
Eric isn’t looking for a relationship. Between running the firehouse and volunteering for the county’s search and rescue team, he has enough on his plate. He doesn’t need to get tangled up with a woman from the big city, especially one whose idea of roughing it is going without designer coffee. Yet from the moment he looks into Victoria’s big brown eyes, the attraction he feels is too strong to deny. Faster than he can imagine, the spark of desire that has smoldered between them since the first day they met will flare into full-blown passion.  But can Eric convince Victoria to set aside her doubts and trust him with her heart before their time together runs out?

But when I took a look at of Du Iz Tak? by Carson Ellis (Walker £11.99) I wondered at first why anyone would bother to send me a picture book in a foreign language. Then I took a second look. This story is written in “bug language”, an idea that borders on lunacy but is in practice a joy and a quirky triumph. It is enormous fun reading this book aloud and trying to decipher exchanges between talkative insects. The illustrations are as clear as the language is alien. We witness the exuberant construction of a tree – or plant – house that, after a while, sprouts a gladdenboot. A what? A flower, silly. It is a refreshing change from the worthily educational: only the most duty-bound parent could be bugged by this (for ages four and up).
Every dog you could imagine is contained within the covetable, cloth-bound pocket book Dogs by Emily Gravett (Two Hoots £7.99). It is a book of contrasts that depends for its success on the wonderful skill and humour of the drawings. These are not fantasy dogs – they are based on shrewd, exact and affectionate observation. When she writes: “I love stroppy dogs… and soppy dogs”, she has a huge frowning boxer and a little fluffy cur with a pink ribbon round its neck. Her barking dog is a tiny tearaway and her non-barking dog looks cowardly and so on – exactly as such dogs do. Even her sleeping dogs you would not want to let lie. A disarming pleasure to read (ages two and up).
A family’s discussion about how they should paint their home in the country is the delightful context for The House of Four Seasons by Roger Duvoisin (the New York Review Children’s Collection £11.99). This was first published in 1956 and is as fresh as if it had only just been painted, which is very much to the point as it is a book that informs children about colour within the family’s conversation. It would serve as a good model to writers unsure how to structure a picture book, as it comes to a perfect, harmonious conclusion, as pleasingly symmetrical as the house itself with the shutters on its facade (ages four and up).
There’s more than a touch of Roald Dahl’s malign exuberance to There’s a Snake in My School! by David Walliams, with illustrations by Tony Ross (Harper Collins £12.99), involving, as it does, a snake that gobbles up a headmistress alive. (Some relative of Miss Trunchbull, perhaps?) This is not one for the faint-hearted, but a story that is told with an energetic confidence that will communicate itself to all its readers. It starts with children bringing their motley pets into school (including a “stupidly cute gerbil”, a “100-year-old tortoise” and a fat cat in a wheelbarrow). Tony Ross can take a bow for lending the story the vitality it deserves, especially in the lavish coils of a snake named Penelope (ages three and up).

A small boy’s rapture at being able to serve President John F Kennedy with a slice of swiss roll is the basis for Patrick and the President by Irish broadcaster Ryan Tubridy, with illustrations by PJ Lynch (Walker £12.99). This is a book that pulls you in against your better judgment. It is the story of President Kennedy’s visit to County Wexford in Ireland in 1963 and what makes it winning is the sense that it is a true story and the tremendous sense of the period brought home in Lynch’s accomplished, emotionally acute illustrations. I particularly like the picture where the boy’s father is steering him in the presidential direction with a plate of cakes – the slightly tense, aspirational expressions of father and son are perfection (ages six and up).
Starting with a horrified rabbit, The Giant Jumperee by Julia Donaldson, with illustrations by Helen Oxenbury (Penguin £12.99), is a picture book that progresses – a sequence that builds. The rabbit has been startled by a loud broadcast from inside his burrow announcing: “I’m the GIANT JUMPEREE and I’m scary as can be!” One by one, different animals try to get to the bottom of it. What makes the story rise above the crowd is the superlative pictures of the animals by Oxenbury, drawn with marvellous expressiveness. She does not let her marmalade cat metamorphose into a cartoon, but his anxious face can nonetheless be read like a book. There is also a wonderful picture of a terrified elephant, winding his trunk round the branch of a tree for reassurance, and a jubilant and side-splitting conclusion (ages two and up).
A small philosophy manual for readers of all ages is provided by the wonderfully original Penguin Problems by Jory John, with illustrations by Lane Smith (Walker £11.99). You would not believe how many problems a penguin can have – starting with the obvious one about not being able to fly in spite of being in possession of wings. Enter a sort of guru walrus who (over a whole page) offers jewel-like advice about the importance of seeing that you are in the right place and inhabiting the moment. This is, plausibly, lost on the little penguin but will not be lost on readers. Lane Smith makes his penguins look like worried clones, which adds to the humour of the whole (all ages).
Finally, another of the New York Review ’s wonderful salvages from the 1950s is The Frog in the Well by Alvin Tresselt, with illustrations by Roger Duvoisin (the New York Review Children’s Collection £11.99). The charm of this book is that the frog is also on a philosophical journey. It is a story about community, while acknowledging that the world is wider than you thought and infinitely more various. The world does not come to an end when you trade familiarity for newness. These are lessons learned by the brilliant, solitary, stunningly green frog who escapes from a dried-up well and finds himself in the wide – and not necessarily frog-unfriendly – world (ages three and up).

0,Nicky Bond (noreply@blogger.com),2017-04-17T11:27:34.000+03:00,[],,,english,0,2017-04-17T11:27:34.000+03:00,,"There will come a time, hopefully in the very near future, when I sit down to write this blog and my thoughts do not immediately turn to the writing, publishing or launch of Carry the Beautiful . Soz guys, but we are not there yet. 

Yes, I know this is getting tedious. It is for me too. But as this blog has become a record of all the blood, sweat, tears and emotion of the entire 'I want to write a book' dream, I feel the need to share the events of the past week - for posterity only. Definitely not for anyone's interest or public demand. I promise I will shut up about it soon. Probably.  



Regular readers will know the book came out last week. That means it became available online in paperback and ebook formats. And whilst I knew that wasn't the end, I had assumed it would signal a calm, chilled out period of time whilst I regrouped and got ready for beginning the next project in a month or so. 

This is the exact opposite of what happened. After feeling all jolly at everyone's good wishes on the launch day, the same feelings lurched dramatically into nausea and panic when I realised real people were actually going to be reading the damn thing. After all the build up, I'd forgotten that people other than my family (who have to be nice) will have paid money for a product I provided. 

Day by day people sent me photos on Facebook or Twitter of their copies of the book arriving in their homes. Current mates, old friends from years ago, and friends of friends I didn't really know, all commented on Twitter , Facebook  or Instagram  that they had their copies. It was utterly thrilling on the one hand. I'd written a book and people had my book. That is the dream! But on the other hand it was terrifying. I'd written a book and people had my book. That is the nightmare! 




As the week has gone on, I have got used to it and the panicky nausea has been truly tempered by the positive things people have said. At the time of writing I have two 5 Star reviews on Amazon, and two 5 Star reviews on the Carry the Beautiful Facebook page.  The buzz of reading those was amazing. I've also had some lovely emails from my scariest reader - a retired English teacher. She definitely knows my grammar is a bit dodge in places, but she said wonderful things that made me smile. I imagine she is having to turn a blind eye to a lot of my nonsense. 

Whilst all this is going on internally, externally I am having fun. I've posted a copy to the British Library  as required. (I am convinced they will just type the details into a database before pulping it, but still.) I've put copies in several Oxfam drop off bins, as well as leaving one on a train I was on. I know my sister is leaving a copy in Mauritius after her holiday, so that's Africa boxed off. A friend in Japan has ordered one so that's Asia taken care of, and Australia is well and truly served by my relatives ordering copies for themselves. I just need to crack on with North and South America, and then global domination is pretty much mine. And the Arctic and Antarctica of course. 



Until that day, I shall continue to swing between elation and the urge to puke. Whilst I'm doing that, have a lovely week, folks.

Are you interested in learning how to generate more customers to your business? If so, you need to know all about lead generation. Here, you will discover many of the techniques that businesses worldwide use to gain leads. TIP! Consumer reviews can help you when attempting to revamp your lead generation techniques. Consumers like to see supportive data before providing you with their personal data or purchasing dollars. 
Make sure the consumer’s purchase cycle is in the forefront of your lead generation planning. Consumers frequently research items before making a final decision. If you are able to flow with this same pattern, you will be far more successful. 
Make certain that you have good landing pages. Try not to send your contacts to a general website. The landing page should give your leads the information they need. Add in a contact form, too, and you should see your leads soar. TIP! Know that leads are valuable. Certain leads may not fit your current campaign. 
Giving an incentive to purchase is a great way to succeed at generating quality leads, because a lot of people will get on board just for the incentive. For instance, if you offer an incentive for something that they want to purchase, they will sign up for your offer. Giving your customers increased incentives to purchase your product will generate more leads for your business. 
Utilize consumer feedback and case studies to produce a larger number of leads. They can help convince customers to work with you. Utilize applicable research to support your claims and also provide real-life testimonials. TIP! Be clear with privacy issues. People who have opted out or chosen not to receive any benefits you offer should not be followed up. 
If you’re trustworthy, you’ll get way more leads. Don’t use ads that have too much hype or are too garish. It is better to use provide facts in your offers to show your consumers the actual value. If you are honest and forthright, people are more likely to trust you. 
Understand lead values. Certain leads are likely not a good fit for your current campaign. By using quality leads, your marketing efforts will be more effective. It’s important to get proper leads. TIP! Make sure that any leads you get are original ones. It is not difficult to get so involved in purchasing or obtaining leads in other manners that you forget that some of your leads may be duplicates. 
Respect people’s requests when it comes to privacy and opting out. Keep track of the leads that you’ve had opt out of getting incentives and offers. You’re not only going to miss out on sales, but you’re going to irritate the people that have asked for privacy. 
When developing lead generation, it is important to find people who want to purchase your product. If you’re looking for a broad audience, generic leads are fine. Your results will be better if your lead gathering is tailored to gather key pieces of information that informs you your product is needed. TIP! Pick up the phone and dial. Pitching your product or service to the local community and businesses will drive more business than you expect. 
Get a calendar set up for lead generation. Possible leads are sometimes delayed if they pose a schedule conflict with your efforts to generate more leads. Creating a schedule makes you come off as more professional and friendly. This keeps you from developing useless pitches towards your leads again and again. 
Seek out subscriptions for your blog. A subscription ensures that your target audience is reminded to check out your business blog and share the things you post. This is always a secondary way for you to get new leads through your current customer base. Blogging can be effective in generating new leads in a multitude of ways. TIP! Are there local events pertaining to your niche that you can take advantage of? Wedding shows may be of benefit to someone in the real estate market. If this is your field, make yourself available at related shows. 
If you really want to bring in leads, you must pair up your website with social media as well. Including Pinterest and Facebook ads will increase the effectiveness of your efforts. Make sure to diverse your marketing campaigns so that you can familiarize yourself with effective and ineffective methods. Direct Mail TIP! One easy option, should your job mesh accordingly, is to reach out to businesses in your community. If you are an experience landscaper, share your knowledge of exotic flowers. 
Don’t take the view that you can’t get anywhere with direct mail. Some marketers are totally focused on saving money with their campaigns, and now ignore direct mail as a viable option. That could mean you will stand out as a business that still prefers this method for marketing. Try it out to see if you get more leads. 
Make sure that your lead database is good for your business. It is likely that there are a limited number of customers interested in your business. When there hasn’t been a pre-qualifying effort, it makes no sense to purchase a lead database. The leads you end up with might not be applicable to your demographic needs. TIP! When thinking about what keywords to use to help gather leads, consider using long-tailed keywords. You have to be careful not do overdo it, but they can be really useful if you choose the right ones. 
Be sure that all visitors to your site know what they are supposed to do. Review each page of your site. You need to make sure the next step is clear. If not, change it so that it is. 
Work on getting more traffic on your lead generation page. It doesn’t matter what type of page you create. Without a way to deliver potential clients, you simply cannot build a list of leads. Focus on driving traffic to your webpage to help ensure success. TIP! Always talk to others around you when you are out and about. There’s no harm in being friendly and you never know who might need what you’re selling. 
Don’t get too focused on contests. If you offer too many contests, your site will only be viewed as a place to win something. Rather, limit your contests to one or two per year just to keep the interest in your business strong. 
Make Facebook a part of your lead generation plan. You can even offer Facebook-specific incentives to your followers. TIP! Be clear on what every part of your website is for. Regardless of your product or service, folks need to understand how to get it. 
You must test your lead generation. This lowers risk as you enter new markets. This is key because it is important to remain open for new avenues for growth without the risk of making major blunders. Testing is an important part of any marketing technique. 
As you can see, it is important that your leads are relevant. A targeted lead could mean a life-long customer. Keep these tips in mind to succeed.

WASHINGTON — Laura Poitras' travel nightmare began more than a decade ago when the award-winning filmmaker started getting detained at airports every time she tried to set foot back in the United States. 
She was stopped without explanation more than 50 times on foreign travel, and dozens more times on domestic trips, before the extra searches suddenly stopped in 2012. Only now is Poitras beginning to unravel the mystery, which goes back to a bloody day in Baghdad in 2004. 
Time after time, airport authorities searched her baggage, rummaged through her electronics and quizzed her for hours about her trips. 
In Germany, she was told her name lights up ""like a Christmas tree"" when security officials scan flight rosters. In Austria, she was told her threat score was ""400 out of 400."" 
At John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, her laptop, video camera, footage and cellphone were taken and held for 41 days. In Newark, New Jersey, a security officer threatened to handcuff her for taking notes with a ballpoint pen that he said could be used as a weapon. 
""I asked for crayons because I thought that would be less threatening to him as a weapon,"" recounted Poitras, whose 2014 documentary film, ""Citizenfour,"" about the National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, won an Academy Award. ""He denied me any kind of writing device."" 
Poitras, 53, knows U.S. government officials are not exactly fans of her politically sensitive work. 
""Citizenfour"" depicted Poitras and journalist Glenn Greenwald's rendezvous with Snowden in a Hong Kong hotel where he handed over classified material documenting NSA's widespread surveillance program. Her new film, ""Risk,"" is about WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. 
Still, she never knew why the security delays started in 2006. She unsuccessfully sought answers from the Homeland Security Department. She finally took the government to court, filing a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in 2015 with help from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties advocacy organization. 
Late last year, as a result of the suit, the government released more than 1,000 pages of documents to Poitras, which she shared with The Associated Press. The documents show for the first time that the U.S. government investigated Poitras on suspicion she might have been involved in an ambush that led to a U.S. soldier's death in Iraq in 2004. 
On Nov. 20, 2004, Poitras was in Baghdad filming ""My Country, My Country."" The film depicts Iraqi elections from the perspective of an Iraqi doctor, who criticized the U.S. occupation yet hoped democracy would take root in his homeland. 
Members of a U.S. Army National Guard unit from Oregon reported seeing a ""white female"" holding a camera on a rooftop just before they were attacked. David Roustum, 22, an Army National Guardsman from West Seneca, New York, was killed. Several troops were wounded. Some guardsmen who saw Poitras suspected she had a heads-up about the attack and didn't share that information with American forces because she wanted to film it. If true, Poitras would have broken U.S. criminal law. 
Poitras called the allegation false and said she didn't film the attack. 
""There is no ambush footage,"" Poitras told the AP. ""That's the narrative that they created, but it doesn't correspond with any facts."" 
After the attack, a lieutenant colonel, whose name was redacted from documents, reported the woman with a camera to his superiors. No action was taken. 
But after returning home, the lieutenant colonel was contacted by author John Bruning of Dallas, Oregon, who was interviewing guardsmen for a book about their experiences in Iraq. According to the government's documents, the author learned about the woman filming on the rooftop before the ambush. 
In an email exchange on Jan. 15, 2006, Poitras confirmed to Bruning that she was filming in the area the day of the attack, but didn't think she could help the author with his research. 
""I was staying in the house of an Iraqi family I was following so my record of the fighting is from the perspective of the family,"" Poitras wrote to Bruning. ""I did not venture out onto the street that day — didn't seem like it would have been a good idea. So I really don't have a document of what took place on the streets."" 
Bruning told the lieutenant colonel that Poitras was the woman on the rooftop. The lieutenant colonel then informed the U.S. military that she could have been involved. 
In February 2006, a military police agent from Fort Lewis, Washington, interviewed the lieutenant colonel and the author. 
Bruning declined to speak to the AP about Poitras. 
But in his sworn statement to military investigators, he said he believed Poitras had prior knowledge of the attack. He said Poitras was staying in a pro-Saddam Hussein neighbourhood ""and she was not in fear of her life or being kidnapped at a time when Western journalists were being abducted and executed."" 
Nevertheless, the Army Criminal Investigation Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, wrote a two-page letter shortly after to the FBI, saying the Army lacked sufficient evidence to charge Poitras. 
It said: ""A review by our legal staff of the information developed thus far revealed credible information does not presently exist to believe Ms. Poitras committed a criminal offence ; however, this could quickly change if Ms. Poitras were to be interviewed and admitted she had knowledge of the ambush and refused to notify U.S. forces in order to further her documentary and media interest."" 
Poitras said she was never interviewed. 
In May 2006, Army officials sent a summary of their investigation of Poitras to FBI headquarters in Washington. 
The airport detentions and delays began shortly thereafter. 
David Lapan, a Homeland Security Department spokesman, said other agencies control who is flagged as a high-risk traveller . When people are flagged, he said, authorities must ""put them through enhanced screening procedures. This is the reason for Ms. Poitras' repeated referrals to secondary screening."" The FBI, which had investigated Poitras, declined to comment. 
The detentions stopped abruptly six years later after a 2012 news article highlighted her travel problems. 
Lapan said Poitras was deemed no longer of ""significant interest."" That allowed Customs in June 2012 to ""discontinue its enhanced screening procedures,"" he said. 
Poitras worries her ordeal will resume. 
She is seeking more information from the government. A federal judge in Washington ruled late last month the FBI hadn't provided adequate justification for withholding some information. 
""I don't know if the investigation is ongoing,"" she said. ""I don't know if it was ended or why it was ended.""

One in a series of posts on Facebook Security and Privacy 
If you use Facebook, you should take the time to review your privacy settings and be deliberate about what details you share with the public (as distinct from just your friends). Setting this appropriately can help prevent annoying people from creating fake Facebook accounts that have the same profile photo and name as you, and that then try to trick all your Facebook contacts into become friends with them. 
There’s no one answer to setting privacy settings. Some people might be quite happy to share everything with everyone whereas others will prefer to keep things strictly between friends. The important thing is that you understand and are comfortable with what you’re sharing to whom. To review your general privacy settings Click on the drop-down menu on the top right in Facebook in your web browser On the left, click Privacy Review the settings and change to your preference if necessary. To restrict who can see your profile picture Go to your Facebook profile (click on your name in the top menu bar in Facebook in your web browser) Click on your profile photo To the right of the photo, click on the icon next to the date Review the current setting and change to your preference if necessary. Choosing a non-public option will reduce the risk of someone copying your profile photo. On the other hand it will make it harder for potential friends to find you. To restrict who can see your friends Go to your Facebook profile Click on Friends Click on the ‘Pencil’ icon (Manage) Click Edit Privacy Review the current settings. Choosing a non-public option will reduce the risk of someone pretending to be you trying to contact all your friends.

Utah Jazz's Joe Johnson scores over the Clippers' Jamal Crawford and DeAndre Jordan to win Game 1. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY Sports)
705 CONNECT TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE LOS ANGELES (AP) — Joe Johnson has seen a lot in his 16 years in the NBA. So the veteran didn't flinch with the clock ticking down and the game tied.
All that experience is why the Utah Jazz brought him in this season.
It paid off when Johnson drove the lane and hit a floater at the buzzer, giving the Jazz a 97-95 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers after Utah lost Rudy Gobert 17 seconds into their playoff opener on Saturday night.
""I just wanted to get as close as I could to the basket, and it was a good thing it went down,"" Johnson said.
Johnson, who scored 21 points, was left isolated against Jamal Crawford on the final play. He powered his way inside and lofted a shot over Crawford and DeAndre Jordan that bounced around the rim before falling in. A video review confirmed it was good.
""I just try to be patient, get to a sweet spot, and make the right play,"" Johnson said.
He's made an NBA-best eight game-winning buzzer-beaters in the past 10 years.
""That's what he's been doing all his career,"" Utah's Boris Diaw said. ""So when he gets the ball at the end of the game, we are pretty confident.""
The Jazz were dealt a blow before either team had settled into the game.
Gobert sprained his left knee on the game's first play when he banged knees with Clippers forward Luc Mbah a Moute, leaving the Jazz without their 7-foot-1 center who averaged 14.0 points and 12.8 rebounds during the regular season.
""We felt and knew that a lot of people probably were counting us out when he went down, but man, we stuck together,"" Johnson said.
Utah steadied itself behind Johnson and fellow veteran George Hill, both of whom were brought in to balance the inexperienced Jazz. Johnson finished with 21 points off the bench and Hill added 16 points.
Gordon Hayward had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Utah.
Blake Griffin scored 26 points and Chris Paul added 25 points and 11 assists for the Clippers, whose seven-game winning streak ended with their first loss since March 26 against Sacramento.
A driving Paul banked in a floater with 13 seconds to go, tying the game at 95.
The Jazz didn't call a timeout.
""We just wanted to have it where they couldn't set up on us,"" Hayward said, glancing at Johnson. ""We just wanted to get it and go and let this man go to work.""
Making their first playoff appearance in five years, the Jazz outshot the Clippers and narrowly controlled the paint, owning a 42-40 edge.
The teams tied with identical 51-31 records in the regular season. The Clippers earned the No. 4 seed and home court by virtue of winning the season series 3-1.
""We fought until the end of the year to get it, and now we've given it right back,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said.
Utah withstood Paul's offensive outburst in the fourth after the Jazz led by eight on Hill's 3-pointer. Paul rattled off 10 straight Los Angeles points, drawing the Clippers to 90-89 on a three-pointer.
Hayward and Johnson scored, keeping the Jazz ahead 94-91. But Johnson lost the ball and Hill fouled Griffin, who made both free throws to get the Clippers to 94-93 with 23 seconds left.
After a timeout by the Jazz, Griffin fouled Derrick Favors, who missed the first and made the second after it hit the rim and went in for a 95-93 lead with 18 seconds left.
""We've got to be better,"" Paul said. ""They played harder, they were more physical.""
Gobert was setting a screen when he and Mbah a Moute made contact and Gobert fell to the court clutching his left leg.
He had to be helped off by Diaw and Hill. A team spokesman said X-rays were negative, and Gobert was taken from Staples Center to have a precautionary MRI.
""We felt a little bit stunned out there,"" Diaw said, ""but then we regrouped and got back on the horse.""
The matchup between Gobert and Jordan was expected to be a key in the best-of-7 series. Jordan finished with 10 points and 15 rebounds and got called for a technical in the fourth with the Clippers down six.
""We have the rule, no fourth-quarter techs, and he got one,"" Rivers said. ""It didn't make a huge difference, but it could have for sure.""
Utah outscored the Clippers 16-10 to open the third before Crawford's jumper put Los Angeles ahead 70-68. Hayward singlehandedly outscored the Clippers 6-0 to send the Jazz into the fourth leading 74-70.
Neither team led by more than six points in the first half. The Clippers were ahead by six when the Jazz outscored them 14-2 in the second quarter to take their own six-point lead. Griffin got stripped under the basket by Hayward, but he hit a 3-pointer and made a layup on the Clippers' next two possessions to key a 14-8 spurt that ended with the half tied 52-all.

Ronald A Guillemette   Krauthammer is a pedestrian neo-con. Trump's unconstitutional attack of Syria was grossly ineffective: he didn't take out Syria's air force; he didn't take out chemical plants. Trump make a knee-jerk decision, contrary to what he said about Obama under similar circumstances years earlier. He did not consult with Congress--something even Obama paid lip service to on Syria. This was an impeachable act. We are over $20T in debt; we cannot afford to be the world's policeman.

If Planned Parenthood's business model is not viable, we have no business propping it up.

It is with a heavy heart that I write to inform you of The Proprietor's decision to axe The Sunday Items. It has always been the errant child of his newspaper group,  Nudes International, and a constant irritant for its incessant attacks on the American and British politicians who he entertains lavishly, and whose strings he tweaks from time to time. In this era of the new illiberalism he can dispense with The Items at a stroke of his pen, by executive order; and without protest, as we have come to accept far worse incursions into freedom of speech and human rights as part of our daily diet of news.

Back in the day when we started as a niche publication, pulling in at least 6 readers a week, and some of those representing keyboarding errors, we could be safely ignored. Since the dramatic upsurge of interest in the Autumn, peaking at over 2000 views per week, we have clearly been seen as a threat to the transatlantic Establishment, the military-industrial complex, the CIA/FBI, the Freemasons, the patriarchy, the Illuminati and FIFA. It was just a matter of time. Dark threats were uttered by intermediaries that Washington in particular was displeased with The Items' depiction of the President as something less than a blessed intellectual giant, paragon of justice and human rights, and orator second only to Dan Quayle in his grasp of languages and World Geography. When the axe fell last night it came swiftly.

The Items is dead. Long live The Items! We will continue without the backing of Mr Merdeok, but on a less frequent basis. We will maintain our name and masthead, for brand recognition but will appear on a monthly basis, at most. This is the only alternative to staff cuts, and the Editor rather feels that his body has suffered enough  from the 'slings and arrows of outrageous fortune' without getting cut in half - not even by a conjuror with a promise of restoration.

Other media will cover this development rather differently, of course. They will say that The Editor was preparing to jump before he was pushed. That age and infirmity meant that the human fabric was being stretched too far between his various commitments, and was threatening to rend apart. In short, he was heading for a gravy Earl, as Dr. Spooner might have put it. There may be a kernel of truth in this, in that staff have heard him muttering about 'spending more time with his dogs' recently. It is true that in the last few years, in addition to editing The Items, he has revised (but not finally signed off, a novel), published an autobiography, written 1.95 plays (which he's had no time to promote) and recently begun to re-launch a company he was forced to abandon a few years back through serious illness. His house needs painting inside and out, his garden is a wasteland and his younger daughter alleges neglect.

Something had to give. Perhaps there is another clue in a recent interview he gave to the Neasden Gazette & Bugle (incorporating the Dollis Hill Review of Books): ""I never meant this blog to be a dialogue or a conversation, but in 63 issues over 15 months, no-one has availed themselves of the Comments section on the blog, not once, not ever. Is there anyone there?  Sometimes it feels like I'm throwing a cocktail sausage around an empty Albert Hall (although I'm aware this image has another connotation). Do Blogspot just make up the numbers? There is no feedback. I'm not bitter, just a little disappointed"", he said, with a slight moistening of his good eye. On the other hand he reported an astonishing breadth of global support for the Items as audience analysis reveals a sprinkling of readers in Thailand, Alaska, Albania, Brazil, Romania, Iraq, Russia, China, and South Africa, to name a few. And that 80% of the total readership come from the US. Nostalgic expats, presumably,

The Items, like HMS Titanic McArkface (featured last week) has choppy waters to negotiate. It will need your support and loyalty. If you have enjoyed any of it, say so and tell your friends and us. It is not sunk, nor holed below the waterline, it is simply a less frequent ferry to that rather bizarre country of peculiar humour, single-issue politics and embarrassing fits of personal disclosure. We hope you will stay with the ship (enough maritime metaphors. Ed). All issues will be well flagged up on Twitter and Facebook. Who will salute?

The Editor asks a favour: please communicate either your name or your email address to The Items via facebook chat (to David Milner), or the Items' comments section (at the end). We need proof you exist and an individual channel of communication. Or send something you might like to see 'in print,' text or picture, original or second-hand. Don't make us beg.






       








                                                       



In June 1994 I was invited to visit the orphanage in Siret, N.E.Romania (see FESS, chapters  53-5) one of many left behind by the monstrous Ceaucescu dictatorship and their disastrous population- expansion programme. It was a place of such massively insanitary deprivation that the stench of urine and faeces that had soaked into the floor-boards over years, greeted the visitor before entering the building: inside, it was like a hammer blow. Inevitably, back in the UK, I became involved in fund-raising activities, the most successful of which was an annual quiz-night in the University of Westminster, the first one raised £150, the last over £1000. There was a unique chemistry in these events that guaranteed a good night for everyone; there was never a dud one. Good-natured competition, constant banter, humour in the quiz itself, feats of memory and enlightened guesswork or fabrication or cheating, plus alcohol or medicinal cannabinoids, were the vital ingredients in evenings which were by far the most successful social events of the year. On one particularly memorable night, a Professor (whose name escapes me), compèred the evening in full drag. At the end of the evening a brave student challenged him to 'show us your tits', whereupon he reached into his bra with both hands and scattered about 20 odd socks over the audience: the sequence somehow found its way onto 'You've Been Framed', thankfully without attribution.

Going off at a slight tangent, I have to tell you that academics are are not paid very well. Similarly qualified professionals in medicine and law generally earn at lest 50% more, and even greater sums in business and industry, or local authorities. Academic pensions are proportionately meagre. Discovering the mismatch between income and outgoings in retirement, I decided to busk while selling the Big Issue at the same time. David Bowie made this possible: ""Ch-ch-ch change is 25p"" works for a while, but the sympathetic glances of old students, much richer than I, were unbearable.

Then I had the idea of putting the long experience of quiz nights I had acquired over the years to 'commercial' use by starting a company to produce and distribute quizzes: high quality, innovative, entertaining quizzes that would appeal to many different audiences. When I went 'on the road' to sell them to pubs, it was very successful: could I think about what colour Aston Martin I might order? Not really, because coincidentally I became seriously ill with acute thyrotoxicosis, which I survived, obviously, but not by much. A long period or recovery and convalescence followed, succeeded by the birth of FESS, and a lot of other writing. The quiz business quietly gathered dust, on the shelf.

Something stirred, just before last Christmas: the realisation that we could deliver the quizzes via a website, which solved a key difficulty of the earlier system. Other ideas for a much wider constituency of audiences emerged: it had always been intended that the quizzes would be made available to the NHS for bedside televisions on a not-for profit basis; in addition we realised it could be supplied to charities and other causes to raise significant income through local groups on a long term basis. In a good way this completes the circle, for the origins of the whole enterprise and the motivation behind it were purely altruistic, for the benefit of the Romanian orphanage.

Just to get an idea of possible demand, I put up Quizmas, the Christmas quiz, on this blog. Despite all the competing demands of television and social life over the holiday, there was an overwhelmingly positive response: nearly 75% of the usual readership 'hit' the quiz.

'Q&A quizmasters' was formed as a limited company in January. There is now a period of several months 'research and development' while we accumulate a catalogue of quizzes, covering not only an all-purpose general knowledge quiz, but also a football quiz for pubs and sports bars, and a Senior Quiz for entertainment and cognitive stimulation in residential care homes, day-centres etc. It has to be stressed that this is simultaneously a commercial enterprise (at a commercial rate of payment), and an aid for charities and other fund-raising bodies at minimal or no cost.

A website is under construction, but a temporary site with the most basic information has just been published at:   www.davidmilner7773.wix.com/qandammq   

This is not a one-man-band, but it is not an orchestra, either. We are hoping that other people may wish join us, to 'crowd-fund' the enterprise NOT with money, but with assistance, for example, submitting questions (and answers!) If either the commercial or altruistic aspects of the enterprise appeal to you, please get in touch through Facebook chat (Q&A quizmasters) or through the email address on the temporary website. Before there is any revenue stream we cannot pay for these contributions; as that materialises we intend to do so, and for major contributions we will consider offering equity in the company. 

Charity quiz-nights operate on the principle of raising money while enjoying yourselves: preparing quizzes operates on the same principle. Do a Good Thing today: have a look at the site and get in touch...



A quiz company seems like a trivial pursuit in the context of the last 72 hours: the Cuba Crisis meets Groundhog Day as Trump and the North Koreans posture like caricatures of macho narcissists. Sabre-rattling it may be, but the weapons are 20-megaton nuclear warheads: twenty times the explosive force of the bombs which produced these pictures. If you have a God, pray your ass off.

Each woman contains individual instincts and tendencies relating to signaling attraction, however, many approaches are compatible with others. If you prefer to let a man know you may be interested, you might gain from a 2007 study inside theUniversity of all thePhilippines Baguio which will identified nine alternative methods people signal interest one to the other and rated them with regards to how theywere definitely received. Picking the biggest rated of these approaches may get you off towards great start. Instructions 1 
Be fine. Coming on overly strongmight shock the guy from. Touching is just the right example. A slight touch--a quick hands on his limb, for instance--shows a interest. A too-aggressive look shows you're threatening. A subtle approach usually is more pleasing, therefore will give him longer to think all the attraction was some idea. 2 
Smile. A legitimate smile is a good universal signal in fondness, and it enables you to more beautiful, also. 3 
Say greetings. A warm greeting as soon as you seehim undoubtedlybeats shier conducts, which could discover as cold as well as indifferent. 4 
Start a new conversation. This is certainly maybe the trickiest tip. Talk about a thing interesting and neutral--a topic which sometimes be discussed by any 2 different people, attracted or certainly not. The weather is actually a cliche because is it doesn't ultimate common surface. Use it being model. Bring up a thought as well as a perception that matters to your. 5 
Generate closeness. Bit by tid bit, your goal is to sort through know him and then be known through him. Obviously, once he knows you potentially he'll know on the subject of your feelings in the direction of him. So move things where direction, gradually. Reveal understanding of yourself, and make inquiries about him. 6 
Ask your man for his thoughts. It's an easy solution to get him to speak about anything from motion pictures and music in order to global politics and philosophical ideas. 7 
Show involvement with what he states. Active listening is a superb indicator of ones own interest. It don't hurt his confidence, either. 8 
Offer that can help him. Be very careful, though. You don't desire to seem too ingratiating. If ever the situation arises whereby he clearly needs give assistance with something and you may be easily able to remain of service, do not delay - volunteer. 9 
Create how to spend time withthe help of him. Sharedtasks are an alternative way to do this. If you ever both need to surf for lamps, do research inside a library, or look at the DMV, then an individualhas a window of chance. You'll be permitting him know you happen to be interested, and you'll have the opportunity to get to know the other person better without rushing a ask for date.

You need to do an exhaustive research when you require the services of a reliable specialist in commercial cleaning. This is because identifying a competent cleaner is not a walk in the park. You are therefore encouraged to carry out the exercise in a cautious manner in order to make an informed decision. To actualize this, you are expected to be in the know of certain aspects that need to be put into consideration. For the right professional commercial cleaning services Indianapolis IN residents may search locally or online.

Interrogations can be very helpful to a person looking for the services of these cleaners. Arrange to interview several of them exhaustively. This way, you stand a good stead to know who among the many shortlisted candidates is reliable. In order to ask only the relevant issues, prepare a good questionnaire early in advance. Below are some aspects to consider so as to land an experienced cleaning expert in Indianapolis IN.

To start with, people around you can give you recommendations that can be very helpful. Close acquaintances and family members can recommend you competent expert cleaners in your state. Avoid at all costs engaging with the first specialist you are recommended to.

Secondly, consider doing online search if recommendations from other people are leading you nowhere. You simply need to have the relevant keywords in order to gain access to the websites of commercial cleaning service providers. Go for those who have done praiseworthy work to their customers. That is why it is important to look at the review pages to check comments posted by past clients. Avoid at all costs dealing with companies with bad comments from past customers.

Thirdly, your potential cleaning specialist ought to be willing to furnish you with references. Get the contact information of all the people they have worked for in the past. Consider calling them so as to ask about the quality of services delivered by the company in question. If a cleaner is willing to give you a referencing list, just look elsewhere.

Again, the level of experience of your chosen candidate should not be forgotten when considering the other aspects. Remember that apart from knowledge acquired in training, cleaners gain a lot of hands-on experience. This way, you will get all the value for your money. Do not risk engaging with inexperienced quacks.

It is true that you are on the safe side by hiring a qualified cleaner in your state. Look at the qualification level of your prospective candidate before you make that vital decision. Also, ascertain that the qualification papers have been issued by an established training institution. Make sure you check the documents in person to prove their authenticity.

In conclusion, a company with the necessary operating permits is the one that should be given the first slot. Make sure that the license is valid and up to date. Also, remember that the same document spells out the area of jurisdiction of a certain service provider.

I admit it. My life isn’t everything I hoped for at this stage. But it’s more than I hoped for in terms of my business, career, finances, freedom, and world impact. 
I’ve done well in business because of certain principles I’ve followed, which I’d like to share here. It will mostly be geared towards writing books (my main business), but the applications are broader than that. 
These are the nine principles of business I operate by. 
Make every decision for it’s impact in five years, not by today’s impact. I’ve released only four products in the last four years because I don’t really consider the initial book launch to be very important for my business. The launch is important for exposure, but beyond a minimum amount of exposure, I believe the best products will thrive for years on word of mouth advertising. Many people say you can’t rely on word of mouth, and that’s true to some extent, but people are going to talk about what they like. 
If you do a search of “mini habits” in Google, you’ll see it has been mentioned on dozens of blogs, and I didn’t ask a single person to write about it. They all chose to do it. It’s amazing! 
Make your customer feel like they got the better deal. Many businesses aim to squeeze every possible penny out of customers, and there’s honestly nothing wrong with it (it’s just business). I, however, want customers of my products to feel like they ripped me off. Strategically speaking, that makes them feel somewhat indebted to you because you’ve given them more than you’ve taken. 
This is the way I feel about Amazon (my favorite company), even though I’ve spent many thousands of dollars on their site and services. Their customer service, offerings, and overall experience is so beyond what I’ve experienced elsewhere that I don’t even consider giving other companies my money. 
Don’t create products to make money, create products to solve real problems. This is controversial, because you can definitely make money by trying to make money directly. Personally, I think you can make more money long term by focusing on solving real problems (when combined with the other strategies I’ll mention). Maybe I’m just lucky, but this is what’s worked for me. I think book readers are perceptive and can tell the intent of the author, and it’s obviously better to give the impression that you’re really trying to add value to their lives. 
Create unique products in popular categories. Don’t copy anything unless it’s a process, tactics, and strategies. There are a lot of things you should copy. For example, I’ve copied the model of giving something away as an incentive for people to sign up to my email list. I’ve copied the idea of using a pop up to drive email subscriptions (because they work). In my book, I’ve copied the idea of advertising my other products in the beginning and end of the book. These are tactical moves to increase my number of subscribers, views, and sales. I use Scrivener because I saw other authors use it successfully. 
My products’ content, however, is unique. You will find some similar ideas in other books, but on the whole, my books are only comparable to those who have copied me . To create unique products, look for gaps . 
I look for gaps in the market where my ideas and skills can fit. When you look for gaps in the market, you are automatically trying not to copy anyone else. A gap in the market means there’s a currently unmet need, and if you copied someone else, you wouldn’t be meeting that need. 
Do your research. You can research many different things: your market, relevant science, similar products, and more. This basically means to be prepared. When you do more research than most, you’ll have the knowledge to create a superior product than most. Mini Habits for Weight Loss took me 1.5 years of daily work to research and write. 
Prioritize the customer experience. Whatever your product or service, it helps to imagine yourself as the customer. What does the experience with your product feel like? For this reason, I add humor to my books, often in unexpected places. Especially since my books cover scientific topics, it’s extremely important for me to make my books entertaining and not a long lecture. 
Never cheat. Many people in the book business will compromise their integrity to gain reviews. Not me. I have never and will never pay or trade or ask for a positive review of any of my books. I even guarantee that on each of my books’ pages on Amazon. 
If you’re cheating, it means you don’t believe in your product, which means you shouldn’t be in business in the first place. 
Name your products wisely. I like to coin terms for my products because it makes them easier to remember and tell others about. If you tell someone about Mini Habits , they’ll be able to find me and my books with a simple Google search. If I had written a book called “Habit Formation Tips,” they would more likely forget the name or confuse it with another book. 
Coining terms like “mini habits” or “imperfectionist” comes with some risk. People aren’t going to search for your made up name before they know about it. Products that rely heavily on search engines to get initial customers might be harmed by having an unexpected name. That’s where generic but descriptive titles have an edge. If “Habit Formation Tips” was my book name, people probably search for that exact phrase in Google and might stumble upon it. 
It comes down to risk and reward. Because I coined the term “mini habits” and it did so well, I now have a brand . Brands are the best way to establish and build trust with consumers. The mini habits brand is extremely valuable because it’s well-liked by many. 
Build trust and protect it above all else. I spent so much time on Mini Habits for Weight Loss because it is a part of that brand, and I knew it would either continue to build trust in the brand or harm it. Every person who has read both books has said that Mini Habits for Weight Loss was worth reading on top of the original Mini Habits book. That exemplifies everything I’ve said. If it was basically the same as the first book but with a few weight loss mini habits tacked on, I would have made some money just from the success of the first book, but it would have damaged trust in me and the Mini Habits brand. 
Look at United Airlines to see the importance of trust. Their recent fiasco in which they forcefully removed a passenger has already cost them more than a billion dollars in stock value. Even worse, I’ve seen something that’s much scarier for them—several of my friends on Facebook vowed to never fly with them again . They’re not the only ones. Here are just a couple comments by people on a Youtube news video about the event (notice the high amount of upvotes). 
This was one small event in 90 years of their company’s existence, but because it damaged their trustworthiness, it will hurt their business permanently unless they can regain consumer’s trust. That could take a long time. It’s much easier to maintain trust than to try to recoup it once you’ve lost it. Conclusion 
I believe the best thing a business can do is create and build trust with its customers. That’s what I strive to do, and that alone with a long-term perspective are the driving forces behind all of my business philosophies.",My 9 Principles of Business Success,http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrGjhmuRPu61mLlIaP0Z6gXcV_8XKLBLEQi5DtoVD.I_bU2A6wIZMTC3GdIMJqRT.1N5bZBYKIQtQ--,1009fed2f1b051de9f20f5367a3d3a6b9ce7df9e,stephenguise.com,,http://deepexistence.com/feed/,Stephen Guise,US,,0,stephenguise.com,1,My 9 Principles of Business Success,0.0,blogs,0,[],"[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'amazon'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'united airlines'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'google'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'amazon'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'facebook'}]"

This article is a non-exhaustive list of political achievements (and failures) of United States President Donald Trump (and also Congress ) in passing conservative legislation, advancing conservative ideals, and ""Making America Great Again"". 
When adding additional examples, please add at least one reliable source for each example for future reference. Contents Republican National Convention and 2016 election Primaries and convention See also: 2016 U.S. presidential election#Primaries and convention The National Rifle Association strongly endorsed Trump in May 2016 in one of its earliest endorsements ever, before Trump became the official GOP nominee. [1] [2] The Republican Party drafted and approved a very conservative platform in 2016. [3] Among its many provisions was very strong pro-life language that recognized the right to life of unborn human beings and condemning Planned Parenthood . [4] Historic general election victory 
Not only did Trump experience a major and historic election victory upset, winning states like Wisconsin , Pennsylvania , and Michigan , that Republicans had not won in years, but they broke other records and won in other levels of government as well. Trump Transition 
Despite not even being inaugurated, Trump made several notable accomplishments. November 2016 — In an effort to ""Drain the Swamp,"" Trump instituted a 5-year lobbying ban for potential administration picks as well as transition team members. [5] This is much longer than Barack Obama 's ban, which was for two years. [6] After Trump's election and because of his strong criticism of outsourcing, numerous businesses have specifically backed off from outsourcing jobs to foreign nations, citing Trump as either the reason or a large reason. [7] [8] [9] In June 2016, President Barack Obama told a Carrier employee at a town hall meeting that there was nothing that could be done about the trend of jobs leaving America. Less than a month after Trump’s election win, Carrier tweeted that they reached a deal with the President-elect to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indiana. Trump also motivated Ford to scrap their plans for a $1.6 billion plant planned for Mexico and instead will invest $700 million in a Michigan assembly plant creating 700 new jobs. [10] Trump picked the most conservative cabinet , at least in recent U.S. history. [11] [12] In addition, rather than picking establishment Washington RINOs with worthless governmental experience in the capital city , Trump chose an unorthodox cabinet of true conservatives, small-government proponents, and outsiders. [13] [14] Additionally, Trump nominated David Friedman —one of the most pro- Israel figures in the entire world—as U.S. ambassador to Israel (which other Republicans likely would not have done), [15] [16] and he ordered all of Obama's ambassadors to leave by Inauguration Day. [17] [18] December 2016 — In foreign policy, even before being inaugurated, Trump broke decades of leftist policy instituted by liberal Jimmy Carter by answering a phone call from the president of Taiwan , which showed he is able to stand up to the ""People's"" ""Republic"" of China . [19] [20] December 2016/January 2017 — Trump criticized Boeing and Lockheed Martin for selling the U.S. overpriced weaponry (including the failed F-35 Lightning II program), and he criticized Boeing for planning an extremely overpriced new Air Force One . [21] After criticizing Boeing over Air Force One and meeting with its executives, the company's CEO assured Trump that the new plane would not be over budget. [22] January 2017 — Trump stopped the GOP-controlled House from changing the House Ethics Oversight panel rules after tweeting against the change. [23] While the panel does have problems that the proposed change would address and many fake MSM news surrounding it, [24] Trump reminded the House to focus first on helping the American people rather than themselves. Due to Trump's election, U.S. generals in Iraq fighting the Islamic State began taking greater freedom to conduct operations in the way they saw fit. [25] As U.S. President Trump being sworn in, January 20, 2017. 
Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017, giving one of the strongest inauguration addresses in American history. [26] [27] [28] His first bill signed as president was to allow retired general and Defense Secretary nominee James Mattis to be confirmed. [29] Trump had a very busy and productive first week, undoing Obama's legacy and instituting conservative executive orders. [30] [31] [32] He made a large impact by his 50th day in office. [33] 
Due to his promotion and support of conservative, America First [34] policies, President Trump faced large opposition from the left, including from within the government bureaucracy. [35] [36] (The fact that members of the Deep State have grown visibly scared of reports stating such confirms this view. [37] ) As a testament to the deep opposition and hatred towards him by the left-wing, at least 217 violent protestors were arrested in Washington D.C. on Inauguration Day. [38] [39] Additionally, Senate Democrats unduly delayed Trump's cabinet nominees at historic and unprecedented proportions—by February 8, 2017, only George Washington had fewer cabinet nominees confirmed by this length of time into his presidency. [40] As in the 2016 presidential election, the mainstream media strongly opposed Trump and wrote him off as a failure early in his presidency, despite his numerous accomplishments by that time. [41] 
Congressional Republicans were more united during Trump's presidency than in any other time in recent U.S. political history. [42] Social policy Legislation signed March 27, 2017—One of the four Congressional Review bills that Trump signed into law that day repealed Obama's Blacklisting Rule , which would have required firms contracted by federal agencies to release every claim of unfair labor practices concerning them – something which would have given unionized contractors an upper-hand. On the same day, President Trump signed an executive order repealing the contracting rule. [43] Executive actions January 20, 2017—On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that would lessen Obamacare 's burden while Republicans work to repeal and replace the failed bureaucratic law. [44] [45] February 9, 2017—President Trump signed three executive orders pertaining to law enforcement. The first cracked down and strengthens the law against international crime organizations, the second deals with anti-law enforcement crimes, and third with finding a strategy for reducing crime in general, ""including, in particular, illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and violent crime."" [46] February 22, 2017—President Trump rescinded former President Obama's pro- transgender guidelines for schools receiving federal aid that are subject to Title IX . [47] A day earlier, the Trump Administration announced it would discontinue Obama's pro-transgender policies. [48] March 27, 2017—President Trump signed an executive order repealing Obama-era requirements for federal contractors, along with signing a bill that day on the same topic. [43] April 3, 2017—Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the Department of Justice to review Obama's agreements with local police departments. Sessions made this order to give back local control to police departments. [49] April 14, 2017—President Trump appointed Roger Severino, a strong defender of religious liberty , to the HHS Office for Civil Rights. [50] [51] April 14, 2017—The Justice Department dropped its lawsuit against North Carolina that alleged discrimination with its ""bathroom bill"" (filed under the Obama Administration) after a compromise bill was passed. Homosexual activists still opposed the new bill. [52] Abortion Legislation signed April 13, 2017—President Trump signed a Congressional Review bill into law annulling a pending Obama Administration regulation that would have required states to fund abortion organizations such as Planned Parenthood . [53] The Act was ""the first major national pro-life bill in more than a decade."" [54] Executive actions January 23, 2017—President Trump signed an order reinstating the Mexico City Policy , which defunded International Planned Parenthood and other organizations that promote foreign abortions. [55] [56] April 4, 2017—The Trump Administration halted U.S. funding of the United Nations Population Fund, which has links to inhumane abortion programs such as China 's one-child policy . Instead, the $32.5 million was shifted to the U.S. Agency for International Development. [57] Gun politics Legislation signed February 28, 2017—President Trump signed a bill into law (Public Law 115-8) [58] repealing a Social Security Administration rule adding mental disability determinations to the background check registry, subject to a person applying to be removed from the list. [59] [60] [61] Congress had passed a law requiring federal agencies to search their records for people who were ""mentally defective"", and the Social Security Administration had published their method of gathering names on December 16, 2016. The regulation would have added the names of disability beneficiaries who have a mental illness or are not competent to manage their own finances, potentially leading to the removal of Second Amendment rights to many perfectly competent, mentally healthy citizens. [60] [62] By signing the resolution of disapproval, the Social Security Administration cannot come up with different criteria for supplying names to the background check registry for 10 years. Executive actions Immigration, illegal immigration, and border security 
According to data released early in Trump's presidency, illegal border crossings decreased by 40% in the first month of Trump's presidency – a remarkable achievement, considering that illegal immigration usually increases by 10 to 20% in January and February. [63] [64] In March, illegal immigration had fallen by over 60%. [65] It was reported in April that illegal immigration levels had fallen to the lowest point in 17 years. [66] Illegal immigration dropped so much that U.S. Customs and Border Protection was able to close on of their temporary holding facilities. [67] This drop was probably due to the Trump effect . [68] 
President Trump worked to eliminate Obama's legacy of giving privileges to illegal immigrants in detention centers. [69] Legislation signed Trump signing his Jan. 27, 2017 order regarding refugees and travel from high-risk countries. Countries affected by Trump's Jan. 27, 2017 travel ban. January 25, 2017—Trump signed two executive orders. The first one included ordering the ""immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border,"" the hiring of 5,000 additional border control agents, and ending ""catch-and-release"" policies for illegal immigrants. The second order called for hiring an additional 10,000 federal immigration officers, re-establishing the Secure Communities Program and other local partnerships, making the deportation of criminal illegal immigrants a priority, directing the State Department to use leverage to ensure countries-of-origin take back illegal immigrants, and stripping federal grant money from sanctuary cities and states . [70] [71] January 25, 2017—Trump promised to investigate voter fraud in the U.S. While this appears to have only been an announcement of a future action, it shows that President Trump is serious about voter fraud. [72] January 27, 2017—Trump signed an executive order indefinitely banning the admission of Syrian refugees, suspending the overall refugee program for 120 days, suspending entry and the issuing of visas from seven failed Middle Eastern countries [73] for at least 90 days, and reducing the number of refugees allowed into the nation during the fiscal year from 110,000 to 50,000. [74] [75] [76] Additionally, Trump made clear that he would help Christian refugees, a reversal from the Obama Administration. [77] Despite criticism from leftists and non-conservatives, 49 percent of the American public supported the decision compared to 41 percent opposed, according to the ""mainstream"" Reuters, [78] and 57% percent of likely American voters supported the ban according to Rasmussen. [79] Additionally, while the leftist establishment European leaders opposed the ban, a strong majority—55% average—of Europeans support the ban, according to a poll in 10 European Union nations. [80] [81] March 6, 2017—President Trump signed a second executive order concerning the temporary suspension of refugees and others from certain high-risk countries after the first one was blocked by the courts. The second order made some clarifications and minor improvements over the first, such as exempting green card holders from the ban and excluding Iraq from it as it had developed an acceptable vetting process. [82] [83] On March 31, 2017, after talking tough against ""sanctuary cities"" and illegal immigration, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a plan to speed up the deportation of imprisoned illegals. [84] [85] On April 11, 2017, Sessions issued a memorandum to U.S. attorneys, instructing them to enforce much stricter guidelines against immigration crimes, [86] and he announced the Justice Department would hire 125 immigration judges in the next two years. [87] Late March/Early April 2017—The Trump Administration cracked down on H-1B visas in a series of actions, making it much more difficult for entry-level programmers to enter the U.S., combating corruption in the program, and making sure that Americans were not discriminated against. [88] April 14, 2017—President Trump appointed two conservatives on immigration issues to senior positions in the Department of Homeland Security. [89] Energy and environmental policy Legislation signed February 14, 2017 - Trump signed H.J.Res.41 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of a rule submitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to ""Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers"" (see ""Size of Government"" section below). [90] Executive actions January 24, 2017—Trump signed two orders reviving consideration for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline projects, which Obama halted due to supposed environmental concerns. [91] On March 24, 2017, the Trump Administration approved the Keystone XL Pipeline. [92] January 24, 2017—In addition to the above, Trump signed three other orders, one requiring the United States Secretary of Commerce make a plan within six months mandating all new or improved pipelines be made with American steel, another order requiring every federal agency to streamline manufacturing regulations, and the third allowing fast-track approval for important infrastructure projects. [93] March 18, 2017—The Trump Administration forced the G-20 to remove any mention of climate change from its joint statement. [94] [95] (See ""Foreign policy"" section below) March 28, 2017—President Trump signed a major executive order repealing several Obama-era environmental regulations unfavorable to coal. In addition to this, the order started an immediate review of Obama's Clean Power Plan, help create American energy jobs, bring American energy independence by stimulating domestic energy production, and giving authority back to the states. [96] [97] Economic policy Legislation signed Executive actions February 3, 2017—Trump signed an order directing Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, upon his confirmation, to plan changes to the Dodd-Frank bank regulatory law in order to cut much of it. [98] [99] Trade Legislation signed Executive actions January 23, 2017—Trump signed an order which withdrew the United States from the globalist Trans-Pacific Partnership . [100] March 18, 2017—The Trump Administration forced the G-20 to remove its opposition to protectionism and its support for free trade from its joint statement. [101] [102] (See ""Foreign policy"" section below) March 31, 2017—President Trump signed two orders. The first order instituted a crackdown on violations of anti- dumping laws and help to officials to collect penalties already owed to the U.S. The second order ordered a report by the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative on the causes of the U.S. trade deficit due within 90 days. [103] [104] Foreign policy President Trump being briefed on April 6, 2017 concerning a military strike on Syria. 
President Trump was observed early in his presidency to have adopted a strong foreign policy. [105] This was as opposed to Barack Obama's foreign policy. [106] As the North Korean vice-foreign minister stated, Trump's foreign policy was ""more vicious and more aggressive"" than that of Barack Obama. [107] Fox News reported that the Trump Administration has adopted a more critical stance toward the United Nations than the Obama Administration. [108] Legislation signed Executive actions February 3, 2017—After Iran tested a ballistic missile in apparent violation of a UN Security Council resolution, the Trump Administration instituted unilateral economic sanctions against 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies. [109] [110] March 2017—After the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia authored a destructive and anti-Semitic [111] [112] report against Israel , the report and agency were strongly criticized by the United States and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley , and the executive director of the commission resigned in response. [113] [114] On March 18, 2017, the Trump Administration successfully forced the G-20 to remove its opposition to protectionism and temper its support for free trade , [101] [102] and any mention of climate change [94] [95] from its joint statement. Later, in April 2017, the Trump Administration refused to sign the G7 joint statement because the other nations could not agree to include support for nuclear and fossil fuels without support for the Paris climate agreement. The G7, thus, went without a joint statement. [115] [116] April 6, 2017—After the Syrian government used chemical weapons on its people, President Trump ordered a one-time airstrike against a Syrian air base, firing 60 cruise missiles at it. [117] The U.S. destroyed about 20 Syrian jet planes and caused extremely heavy damage on the base. [118] Defense Secretary James Mattis stated the attacks destroyed 20% of Syria's operational aircraft. [119] As even the New York Times reported, Trump's action was a show of U.S. strength, and it was in stark contrast to Obama, as Trump used surprise and speed in the attacks. [120] World leaders supported the strong action. [121] This was the first direct military action the U.S. took against the Assad regime. [122] MOAB, the ""Mother Of All bombs"" April 13, 2017—Under the increased autonomy President Trump have to his generals, [123] the U.S. dropped a GBU-43B (also known as MOAB or the ""Mother Of All bombs""), the largest non- nuclear bomb in existence at 21,000 pounds on a complex of Islamic State tunnels in Afghanistan . Although tested in 2003, the bomb had never been used in combat before. [124] It was estimated to have killed 36 ISIS fighters, [125] including ISIS commander Siddiq Yar. [126] Size of Government 
President Trump and Congress spent much time rolling back regulations, particularly those created by Obama. [127] [128] In the first six weeks of Trump's presidency, over 90 regulations were repealed, whether through executive orders, Acts of Congress, or other means [129] [130] — clearly keeping his promises. [131] He has successfully made use of Congressional Review numerous times to roll back Obama-era regulations—even more than expected. [132] [133] Prior to Trump's presidency, the Congressional Review Act had been used only once successfully, sixteen years prior. [134] Legislation signed February 14, 2017—President Trump signed a bill into law repealing an Obama Era relation requiring energy companies to disclose financial transactions with foreign governments. [90] [135] [136] February 16, 2017—President Trump signed a bill into law blocking the ""Stream Protection Rule,"" an environmental regulation. [137] [138] March 27, 2017—President Trump signed four bills undoing Obama-era regulations. [132] [139] Two of those bills rolled back federal education regulations. [140] March 31, 2017—President Trump signed another bill undoing an Obama-era regulation, giving the power back to the states to expand drug testing for unemployment benefit applicants. [141] April 3, 2017—President Trump signed a bill reversing an Obama-era FCC privacy regulation applicable to internet service providers. The FCC had adopted the rule to fill a gap created by a court case which ruled that the FTC did not have jurisdiction to extend its privacy rule over internet service providers because they were regulated by the FCC. The new law repealed the FCC rule and prohibits the FCC from enacting a replacement for 10 years without giving the FTC jurisdiction to regulate internet service providers' privacy practices. [142] Part of yet another series of bills undoing other Obama regulations. [143] Executive actions January 20, 2017—On its first day in office, the Trump Administration ordered a regulatory freeze on all federal governmental agencies. [144] On Inauguration Day, 2017, the Trump administration instituted a federal hiring freeze. [145] On January 23, 2017, Trump signed an executive order instituting the hiring freeze, from which the military was exempted. [146] On April 12, 2017, the hiring freeze was replaced with a plan to restructure and shrink the executive branch. [147] [148] January 30, 2017—Trump signed an executive order that requires two federal regulations must be eliminated for every regulation created. [149] [150] [151] February 3, 2017—President Trump signed a memorandum directing the United States Department of Labor to review a regulation signed by Obama set to go into effect. [152] February 24, 2017—President Trump signed an executive order requiring every federal agency to create a ""regulatory reform task force"" to find unnecessary, burdensome regulations to repeal. [153] This order was called ""the most far reaching effort to pare back U.S. red tape in recent decades."" [154] February 28, 2017—President Trump announced that he did not plan on filling numerous government positions he considered unnecessary. [155] According to one source, about 2,000 positions were vacant, and most of them were likely included in this list. [156] As of April 4, 2017, President Trump did not make a nomination for nearly 500 positions requiring Senate confirmation. [157] March 13, 2017—President Trump signed an executive order to perform an audit on every executive branch agency in order to reduce spending and waste and improve services. [158] [159] [160] Military Legislation signed Executive actions January 27, 2017—Trump signed a memorandum to begin the expansion and rebuilding of the U.S. military. [161] [162] February 3, 2017—The Trump Administration and Lockheed Martin reached a tentative deal that would purchase 90 F-35 jet at the lowest price in the program's history. [163] Proclamations January 20, 2017—The day he was inaugurated, Trump instituted a national day of patriotism for the country, [164] and a few days later Trump officially designated his inauguration day the National Day of Patriotic Devotion . [165] [166] January 22–28, 2017— National School Choice Week , as proclaimed by President Trump [167] Other On January 5, 2017, the U.S. House passed a motion condemning Obama's allowing a leftist anti-Israel resolution to pass in the UN. [168] [169] Additionally, Trump voiced his strong support for Israel during his transition. [170] [171] January 20, 2017—On the day he took office, Trump returned the bust of UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the Oval Office that Obama removed when he took office. [172] He also accepted the United Kingdom 's offer to re-loan the second identical bust of Churchill, which Obama removed and returned after the first loan expired. [173] January 28, 2017—Trump signed an executive order banning administration officials from lobbying their federal agencies for five years, as well as banning them for life from lobbying foreign nations and political parties. [174] [175] January 30, 2017—Trump showed he would not tolerate incompetent leftist administration officials when he fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates (a left-wing Obama holdover) when she refused to defend his refugee and immigration ban executive order. [176] [177] Trump emulated Ronald Reagan 's firing of the striking PATCO workers in 1981 by doing so, [178] contrary to the mainstream media spin. [179] That same night, Trump replaced the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (another Obama holdover) with a more competent official who had a reputation for enforcing immigration laws. [180] [181] March 10, 2017—Conservative attorney General Jeff Sessions asked the 46 remaining U.S. attorneys appointed by Obama, arguably the most left-wing president in U.S. history, to resign. [182] [183] One of those U.S. attorneys was the failed Zachary Fardon, who was lax in his prosecution of gun crimes (Sessions directed the Justice Department to increase prosecutions on gun-law violations and to reinforce harsh sentences for such). [184] When one of those attorneys, Preet Bharara, refused to resign (likely for political gain), he was fired. [185] March 21, 2017—President Trump signed a bill into law not only funding NASA , but setting a goal of having humans visit Mars ""in the 2030s"" and potentially colonizing another planet. [186] The bill also funded the agency, the first time such a bill was signed into law in seven years. [187] Non-legislative or policy achievements Trump has been bold enough to meet with conservative, right-wing figures who stand boldly for small government and conservatism, unlike many other Republicans. For example, he met with Alex Jones , becoming the first president to have ever met with Alex Jones (the meeting occurred during the campaign). [188] Also, Trump has had very strong relations with Nigel Farage of the United Kingdom Independence Party ., [189] [190] Trump has stood up to political correctness and the left-wing consensus in numerous aspects, most notably for rejecting political correctness and communicating directly to the public rather than the mainstream media . Also, Trump has been bold in rejecting the term ""happy holidays."" January 20, 2017—Trump became the first president to say ""radical Islamic terrorism"" in his inaugural address. [28] [191] January 27, 2017—Vice President Mike Pence became the first vice president in United States history to speak at the annual March for Life march in Washington D.C. [192] [193] Additionally, Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway also spoke at the event, and Trump himself strongly expressed his support for the march. [194] [195] March 1, 2017—The Trump Administration played a large role in successfully helping prevent CIA officer Sabrina de Sousa from being extradited to Italy. [196] President Trump and his administration have not been afraid to criticize the left-wing Obama Administration for its failures, such as its failed and broken ""red line"" promise concerning the Syrian Civil War . [197] The courts Supreme Court President Trump announcing his nomination of Gorsuch, January 31, 2017. 
On January 31, 2017, Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court . [198] [199] The nomination was well received by many conservatives. [200] [201] Others, however, most notably Andrew Schlafly , disagreed with the nomination due to concerns about Gorsuch's position on abortion. [202] [203] The Senate ultimately confirmed Gorsuch on a vote of 54–45, even though the GOP was forced to initiate the nuclear option and lowering the vote threshold to overturn a filibuster for Supreme Court nominees due to Democrat obstructionism. [204] Gorsuch assumed office on April 10, 2017. [205] Trump and the stock market 
With expectations that Trump's election victory would cause the markets to plunge, the Dow Jones Industrial Average actually performed very strongly, closing at the highest level it had ever reached in history after the second day. [206] It is rare for the stock market to rise immediately after a U.S. presidential election regardless of the winner. [206] The stock market had its best week in five years due to optimism of a Trump presidency. [207] 
Trump was very busy in his first week and showed he was serious about his campaign promises. This caused the stock market to increase, and the Dow Jones passed 20,000 points for the first time in its history. [208] [209] On March 1, 2017, the day after Trump made his first address to a joint-session of Congress, the stock market rose dramatically again, with the Dow Jones passing the 21,000 mark for the first time in history. [210] [211] [212] Donald Trump's victories over the liberal media establishment See also: Fake news and Liberal media Donald Trump helped further discredit the mainstream media due to his repeatedly challenging their honesty and by demonstrating that their predictions regarding his candidacy were repeatedly false. Americans who trust the media is at 32%, an all time low, according to the Gallup organization. [213] Additionally, between the 2016 election and late January, trust in the media fell from 21 to 15 percent among Trump voters, and even among Clinton voters it fell from 57 to 51 percent. [214] Donald Trump's humor has cut down leading media figures to size. He told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that if Megyn Kelly didn't repeatedly attack him, her audience would be even smaller than Blitzer's. When asked by George Stephanopoulos what his biggest mistakes were on the campaign trail, he pointed that Stephanopoulos has regrets too and pointed out his donation to the Clinton Foundation. [215] At an hour-long press conference on February 16, 2017, Trump repeatedly criticized the press as biased and ""so dishonest ... out of control."" [216] On February 17, 2017, Trump tweeted: ""The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!"" [217] On February 24, 2017, President Trump excluded several liberal media organizations from attending a press briefing. [218] [219] Donald Trump's establishment of a massive direct line to the public via social media 
Via Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, Donald Trump has established a massive direct link to the American public which is unfiltered by the mainstream media. His social media audience is about 45 million people. [220] Donald Trump's association with conservative media 
Rather than associate with the leftist mainstream media, Trump has associated himself with the conservative media , particularly Fox News . [221] He also became the first president to have ever met with Alex Jones (the meeting occurred during the campaign). [188] Failures January 31, 2017—President Trump announced he would keep a 2014 executive order signed by former President Obama that gave protected status to homosexual employees of the government and federal contractors. [222] [223] Additionally, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner reportedly derailed a proposed executive order protecting religious liberty at the same time. [224] However, supporters of homosexual privileges claimed that a March 27, 2017 order, which repealed much of Obama's 2014 executive order, went against Trump's statement to keep the 2014 Obama order (which, if true, would annul this supposed failure). [225] February 2, 2017—Trump stated that building new settlements in the West Bank ""may not be helpful"" to achieving peace in the Middle East , and he appeared to shift his formerly strong stance on moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem as he had previously stated. [226] President Trump did not sign an executive order ending ""no gun zones"" on schools early in his presidency as promised. [227] February 2017—Despite enacting a crackdown on illegal immigration, [228] President Trump announced he would keep DACA, which basically allows illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to stay. [229] President Trump and congressional Republicans did not repeal and replace ObamaCare immediately or quickly as promised. [230] They failed to agree on or pass a replacement bill for ObamaCare as a part of 2017 budget reconciliation. They withdrew the bill to avoid losing a vote on the House floor. [231] [232] This may not have been a total failure, as polling indicated that only 17% of Americans supported the bill, [233] and its passage would have likely led the GOP to an electoral failure in 2018. [234] Some commentators have stated that Trump used this failure in order to further his agenda in the long run, [235] and Trump himself made clear he was not finished with the issue. [236] As of early April 2017, several Obama-holdovers still hold their positions in the Trump Administration with little to no indication of leaving. [237] [238] As of March 9, 2017, President Trump has not fired Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen , who targeted conservative groups under the Obama Administration. [239] Trump also stated he had no plans on asking FBI director James Comey to resign. [240] In April 2017, President Trump stated he had chosen not to label China a currency manipulator, contrary to a campaign pledge. [241] This action is disputable as a failure, as he said he changed his mind ""because he now believes that China hasn't been manipulating its currency for months and because labeling Beijing a manipulator might jeopardize his talks with the Chinese on confronting the threat of North Korea."" [242] Trump also changed his mind regarding the Export-Import Bank of Washington .

0,Joanna L. Grossman,2017-04-18T11:27:16.000+03:00,[],,,english,0,2017-04-18T11:27:16.000+03:00,,"For the first time, a federal appeals court held squarely that Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. By a vote of 8-3, the Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc , ruled that Kimberly Hively’s lawsuit against Ivy Tech Community College could go forward, giving her the opportunity to prove that she was unlawfully fired because she is a lesbian. This may not sound like a huge victory—just getting permission to start the process over again—but it is. The question whether Title VII protects against LGBT discrimination has been kicked around in federal courts for decades, and no federal appellate court has ever ruled as the Seventh Circuit just did. But as the Seventh Circuit wrote in this new case, Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College , it had “been asked to take a fresh look” given the social and legal developments of those decades, and that is just what it did. The interesting part about the “fresh look,” however, is that the court was able to see what might well have been obvious decades ago—discrimination against people because of sexual orientation is just another species of sex discrimination. Kimberly Hively’s Story Hively is open about her sexual orientation, at work and elsewhere. She took a job as a part-time, adjunct professor at Ivy Tech in the year 2000. She made a significant push to find a full-time position between 2009 and 2014, but her efforts were not successful. In July 2014, her part-time contract was not renewed. She filed a complaint with the EEOC without the help of a lawyer, but she made her point: I have applied for several positions at IVY TECH, fulltime, in the last five years. I believe I am being blocked from fulltime employment without just cause. I believe I am being discriminated against based on my sexual orientation. I believe I have been discriminated against and that my rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act were violated.

And with that simple factual allegation and assertion about her federal rights, Hively tapped into one of the most important controversies in employment law. At the trial court level, her claim was dismissed for failure to state a claim—even if she could prove her sexual orientation was the reason for the failure to hire her full-time or renew her contract, that conduct did not violate Title VII. As has happened in many recent cases, the court didn’t take a serious look at her claim. It simply referred to a line of prior cases that had squarely rejected the legal theory and deferred to them (as lower courts are bound to do). On appeal, however, the Lambda Legal Defense & Education Fund, one of the premier advocacy groups for LGBT rights in the United States took over her case. And that is where the case got interesting. Title VII and Sexual Orientation Claims: A Troubled History Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is the core of federal anti-discrimination law, prohibiting employers with at least fifteen employees from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Sexual orientation is not on the list—nor would one to expect it to be specifically identified in a statute drafted when that term was not routinely used. But courts early on were asked to treat claims of sexual orientation discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. It was a simple enough argument—men should not be discriminated against for being attracted to men, when women are not punished for the same thing, and vice versa. But it was roundly rejected. In Ulane v. Eastern Airlines, Inc. (1984), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit¾the court that just decided Hively’s claim—rejected such a claim with a simple truism: sex discrimination “implies that it is unlawful to discriminate against women because they are women and against men because they are men.” That opinion typified the superficial level of analysis that federal courts engaged in when asked to decide sexual orientation claims. Another well-known example is from the Ninth Circuit in DeSantis v. Pacific Telephone & Telegraph (1979). But like the Ulane opinion, it lacks much by way of meaningful analysis and found it sufficient to note that Congress did not intend to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination when it enacted Title VII in 1964. The problem with that line of reasoning is that Congress probably did not contemplate many of the things we have come to understand as sex discrimination. The meaning of sex discrimination has developed incrementally and grown to encompass a wide variety of policies, practices, and behaviors that impede workplace equality. This happened as courts (especially the Supreme Court) began to understand the true nature of sex discrimination and its deep connection to equal employment opportunity. (This incrementalism is documented and examined, case by case, decade by decade, by Gillian Thomas in her recent book, Because of Sex: One Law, Ten Cases, and Fifty Years that Changed American Women’s Lives at Work . ) During the decades when federal courts were simply unwilling to interpret Title VII in a way that protected LGBT employees, some stop-gap measures were put in place. President Bill Clinton signed an executive order in 1998, which banned sexual orientation discrimination in the civilian federal workforce; President Barack Obama renewed and extended its scope in 2014. The original order was in response to a long history of explicit discrimination by the federal government, which banned gay and lesbian individuals from civil service jobs. (See the unfortunate relics of that history here .) President Obama also, finally, revoked the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” order in 2011, permitting gay and lesbian individuals to serve openly in the military. Meanwhile, in Congress, advocates spent decades trying to amend Title VII to provide express protection against sexual orientation discrimination (and, in some iterations, against gender identity discrimination, as well). No bill of this type ever made it through both houses of Congress, and efforts eventually stalled. State houses took greater initiative to protect LGBT individuals; many of them now have laws prohibiting LGBT discrimination. Supreme Court Rulings That Reflected a More Nuanced Understanding of Sex Discrimination Although plaintiffs did not prevail when asking courts to rule that Title VII prohibits LGBT discrimination, they did prevail in two cases before the High Court that would seem to portend the same result. They both flow from a simple requirement that actionable sex discrimination must have occurred “because of sex.” First, in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins (1989), the Supreme Court ruled that reliance on sex-role stereotyping can be an actionable form of employment discrimination. There, the Court held that a woman was a victim of sex discrimination when her employer denied her partnership in an accounting firm at least in part because she was insufficiently “feminine” in the way she dressed and conducted herself. That decision catalyzed sex-stereotyping theory as an independent cause of action under Title VII, and it was quickly put to use by effeminate gay men and masculine lesbians who claimed that the hostility and adversity they experienced was sex, rather than sexual orientation, discrimination. Second, in Oncale v. Sundowner Services (1998), the Court considered a claim of same-sex harassment. The conservative Fifth Circuit ruled that such a claim could never be actionable under Title VII regardless of the facts or circumstances surrounding the discrimination. It just simply could not be “because of sex” if the claim involved one man harassing another. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed, in an opinion written by Justice Scalia. The Court held that the “because of sex” requirement could be met in at least three ways: (i) with evidence of the perpetrator’s homosexuality; (ii) with evidence that the perpetrator in fact targeted only members of one sex; or (iii) with evidence that the harassment took the form of gender-role policing—under the Price Waterhouse ruling—to punish an employee for failing to live up to traditional gender norms. Oncale has both reinforced the use of Price Waterhouse in sexual orientation claims and fueled separate claims for harassment rooted in homosexual desire or gender-targeted bullying. The Ruling in Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College Although Price Waterhouse and Oncale provided some support for LGBT employees who suffered discrimination—as many of them do—they still faced significant obstacles to addressing discrimination. In the initial appeal in Hively’s case, heard by a panel of three judges, the court applied the Seventh Circuit precedent dictating that Title VII should not be construed to cover sexual orientation discrimination. But when the same issue came before the court en banc (eleven judges instead of three), it got a more serious look. The world had changed since the Seventh Circuit had ruled in Ulane in 1984. It changed in obvious social ways—gay and lesbian Americans came out of the closet in droves, and other people became significantly more tolerant and accepting. But the legal landscape also changed. Those two Supreme Court opinions had created a chink in the armor, opening the door to a wide variety, if sometimes a random variety, of LGBT discrimination claims. Perhaps as importantly, the EEOC adjudicated a case in 2015 in which it held, as a matter of agency interpretation, that discrimination against a man because he was gay constituted a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII. The EEOC’s ruling depended on its view that “[d]iscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is premised on sex-based preferences, assumptions, expectations, stereotypes, or norms.” There is no way to understand this type of discrimination, the ruling reasons, without reference to a person’s sex. Sexual orientation is, by definition, being attracted to a person of the same sex. The EEOC ruling sparked a second look in many courts, leading several federal district courts, which reached the same conclusion. (Discussion of some of those cases can be found here and here .) The Seventh Circuit’s en banc opinion is refreshingly simple. It concludes that discrimination against an employee because of sexual orientation is a form of unlawful sex discrimination. The court, in an opinion written by Chief Judge Diane Wood, began by stating the obvious: it has no power to amend Title VII to add a protected characteristic to the list. But it does have the power to interpret the words already in the statute, including “sex.” It then correctly rejects the suggestion by Ivy Tech that Congress’s repeated, but failed attempts to amend Title VII to add explicit reference to sexual orientation and/or gender identity discrimination make clear that the statute did not already cover those forms of discrimination. A legislative body’s failure to adopt a law could mean any number of things, some of them diametrically opposed to one another. In this case, Congress could have failed to adopt the proposed laws because legislators deemed it obvious that the statute already prohibited those forms of discrimination—or it could mean the opposite, that the statute did not already prohibit LGBT discrimination and advocates did not have the votes to make the change. The court thus rightly left all evidence on that subject to the side. What it did find relevant was the Supreme Court’s opinion in Oncale —not only because it supported protection for harassment motivated by bias against gay and lesbian workers, but also because of the interpretive guidance the Court provided. Justice Scalia wrote in that opinion that while same-sex harassment “was assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII,” courts are charged with interpreting the words used and prohibiting any type of discrimination “that meets the statutory criteria.” The Hively court noted the long evolution of the meaning of “sex discrimination” in Supreme Court opinions that unfolded over several decades. From a simple rule that employers could not refuse to hire a woman for a particular job came a broad spectrum of prohibitions—discrimination against any subset of women, sexual harassment, harassment based on actual assumptions about longevity rooted in gender, and so on. The court identified two reasons that compelled its conclusion that Title VII prohibits sexual orientation discrimination. First, sexual orientation discrimination, at its core, punishes a woman for being attracted to another woman, when it would not punish a man for being attracted to a woman. This “tried-and-true comparative method” shows the significance of the plaintiff’s sex to the employer’s decision. With respect to Hively’s claim, the court wrote that it is “critical . . . that only the variable of the plaintiff’s sex is allowed to change.” Thus, the court does not ask whether the employer would have failed to hire Hively if she was involved with a man. It asks whether she would have been fired if she had been a man who was involved with a woman. This is exactly what the Supreme Court suggested and validated in Oncale , and what many courts have relied on since. This approach, when applied to sexual orientation claims, also draws on the Supreme Court’s ruling in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins . As the Hively court wrote, Viewed through the lens of the gender non-conformity line of cases, HIvely represents the ultimate case of failure to confirm to the female stereotype (at least as understood in a place such as modern America, which views heterosexuality as the norm and other forms of sexuality as exceptional): she is not heterosexual . . . . Hively’s claim is no different from the claims brought by women who were rejected for jobs in traditionally male workplaces, such as fire departments, construction, and policing. The employers in those cases were policing the boundaries of what jobs or behaviors they found acceptable for a woman (or in some cases, for a man).

Second, the court in Hively drew on Loving v. Virginia , in which the Supreme Court held Virginia’s ban on interracial marriage unconstitutional on race discrimination grounds. Virginia could not punish a white person for intimately associating with a black person when it would not have punished a black person for the same thing—and vice versa. Although the Constitution does not regulate the decisions of private employers, this opinion provides a theory of discrimination that is as persuasive in interpreting Title VII as it was in interpreting the Equal Protection Clause. As the court wrote, “[i]t is now accepted that a person who is discriminated against because of the protected characteristic of one with whom she associates is actually being disadvantaged because of her own traits.” This principle had already been accepted in the employment context when employees were punished for interracial relationships; the same principle protects Hively from being discriminated against because she chooses to associate with a person of a particular gender. Conclusion The Hively court did not take its job lightly—it acknowledged contrary authority, and a strong difference of opinion even on the court (the ruling was 8-3). But it was guided by the “logic of the Supreme Court’s decisions, as well as the common-sense reality that it actually impossible to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation without discriminating on the basis of sex.” It’s just that simple. The en banc ruling in Hively is bound to have an effect. In other recent cases, the Eleventh Circuit, in Evans v. Georgia Regional Hospital , ruled similarly, though it did not hit the nail as squarely on the head. Meanwhile, the Second Circuit, in Christiansen v. Omnicom Group, Inc. , bound by an earlier panel ruling in a case that had said sexual orientation claims were not cognizable in Title VII suits, allowed an LGBT plaintiff to proceed on a gender stereotyping theory of discrimination—an alternative path to the same outcome. Hively may just be at the beginning of the trend, but it also may queue up review by the Supreme Court, which just acquired a ninth justice, Neil Gorsuch, a deeply conservative, pro-business jurist.

The Embassy Cafe Address Level 2, The Starling Mall, Jalan SS21/37 Damansara Uptown Petaling Jaya, Malaysia
The Embassy Cafe Facebook Inspired by the warmth and gracious hospitality of embassies from around the world, The Embassy café seeks to bring the exciting spirit of the journey, adventure, friendship and comfort through its food and interior space.
With a nature theme and the signature usage of lines in the interior design, The Embassy infuses natural clean lines that symbolise the fluidity of time, space and evolution that connects all of us in our daily journey and adventure. The Embassy offers cuisine from East & West that blends a culinary combination of something for everybody on one menu.
Our review started off with an order of the cool Iced Mocha RM 14.00 which is matched with our breakfast set.

The Breakfast set that we ordered to taste is the Ambassador’s Big Breakfast  RM 28.00. Our orders came with 2 sunny sides up, toasted sourdough; with 2 pieces of hash brown, beef bacon, chicken bratwurst, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes and baked beans.

Next; we decided to order a salad which is the Oriental Grilled Ribeye Salad RM 24.00. This salad is a little heavy as it comes with streaks of grill rib-eye that is accompanied with fresh leafy greens, tomatoes, cucumber and cilantro served with sesame-soy dressing. A balance salad which can easily be a meal for small eaters.

Next, comes the mains which I ordered the SynFull Roast Chicken for a half chicken portion (RM 35.00). For the smaller eater, you can order the quarter chicken set (RM26.00). You can see that this is a real treat as the skin was a roast to a nice crisp while the meat was still juicy and succulent. We can taste the strong flavor of the spices and herbs marinade that was imbued into the meat. This wholesome meal is served with seasonal vegetables, rosemary butter potatoes and served with a creamy mushroom sauce.

For those that loves the carbs; can order a pasta which we had is the Carbonara (RM 22.00). For those that loves the cheesy feel of the Carbonara sauce will attest to this dish. The pasta was cooked with a smooth cheesy cream sauce,  mushrooms, Parmesan cheese and topped with beef bacon. I am not a big fan of pasta, but this one hit the right note for me.

Our last main was the Embassy Nasi Istimewa RM 28.00. Here at Embassy, they do provide a number of local delights. Apparently, the recipe of these dishes is from one of the owner’s mothers which she has meticulously trained the chef to cook it at close as possible to her recipe. This Nasi Istimewa is served with the Ayam Pindang together with fried rice, anchovies, Tempe Sambal, fried cabbage, Papadams, Kerabu Mangga and topped with sunny side egg. I would have preferred the dish served with plain white rice, as it will be more tasteful.

By the time we tasted the last mains, we were too full to even order our dessert.

Submit Embed this comment into your blog: Comment URL: Presentation Transcript Slide 1 Top 3 DVD Copy Software for Windows and MAC The USB and Cloud storage has become the main source of the data storage, transfer, and backup but still, DVDs have their own status. Most of the important data and games are still coming into the form of DVD. So, DVD is old but not obsolete. Users still prefer to store their personal data on DVDs due to their safe nature. Yes, they are breakable but when corrupting or damaging data there is not many chances. Unlike USB storing or moving the data from the DVD is not just copy/paste task. You need a dedicated DVD burning tool and proper software to do that. Out their many tools are available but not all of them are too friendly and efficient in this task. So, we listed Top 3 DVD software for you. Let's take a look at them one by one: Top 3 DVD Copy software DVDFab DVDFab is the renowned DVD Copy software, it has the 13 years of experience of the development in DVD cloner and DVD burner. The tool can read and backup DVD disc, ISO file or folder to any blank disc. Despite the flash processing speed, DVDFab can output a DVD with quality by no means inferior to the source. And with its Clone mode, you can get a totally lossless output DVD. The reason we choose it on the top in our list features, UI, Performance, Copy speed and much more. The Software has some extraordinary features 6 different copy modes, as Full Disk, Main Movie, Clone/Burn, Merge, Split etc. These modes will enable you to copy the entire DVD or any content you may need with one mouse clicks. Slide 2 Taking about the UI is very much simple and attractive. You can also customize the background of software. It compatible with almost all popular platform like Windows, Mac as well. DVD Cloner DVD cloner is another best tool for the copy the DVD. DVD Cloner is one of the easiest to use, versatility and high-quality output provider. It can make the exact clone of the original of your data and also perform compress the data so it can fit onto smaller-capacity blank discs. Like DVDFab, it also Slide 3 DVD Cloner DVD cloner is another best tool for the copy the DVD. DVD Cloner is one of the easiest to use, versatility and high-quality output provider. It can make the exact clone of the original of your data and also perform compress the data so it can fit onto smaller-capacity blank discs. Like DVDFab, it also performs the merge of contents of multiple DVDs onto a single disc. The UI is pretty much easy to understand for the non-techy users. Like DVDFab, it does not have the 6 Different modes but still got the two copy modules: Express and Expert. Modes work as the name Express mode will let you make the copy of a disk with as little effort on your part as possible. On the other side, Expert mode provides tools to customize and configure your copy before you burn it onto a new disc. In the expert mode, you can select the merge, split as well other options. Slide 4 123 Copy DVD 123 Copy DVD Gold wins the third position in our list, last but not the least. It is more than just DVD copy software also does the converts part like DVDFab. The multifunctional 123 copy DVD allows you to make 1:1 copy of your movies. If you are not a tech user then for you interface would be more complex than the above-listed software. The reason of that, it has tools like converting video files for your Smartphone, creating data discs and more. All the features are not listed as well so it confused a bit more for the first time. Slide 5 The feature which no one does is Decryption DVD. The commercial discs are protected with anti-piracy encryptions that prevent copying. 123 Copy DVD requires you to download and install a decryption plugin before it can copy these DVDs. The software makes the plugin easy to find, and you only have to do it once. After it's installed, you can make new copies of your entire DVD Over to You All 3 are the best DVD copy tools, have some unique features. But we liked the DVDFab because of the simplicity and perform more than one task as Burning DVD, and converting file format. Well this is our opinion, share your also through comment.

F8 fails to surpass the box-office opening sales of Fast and Furious 7 on Thursday. By Charlie Monforte , EnStars on Apr 16, 2017 12:13 PM EDT Sign Up for Newsletter ""Fate of the Furious"" aka F8 fails to surpass the box-office opening sales of Fast and Furious 7 on Thursday. (Photo : The Flash 4K/YouTube) Advertisement Despite the revved up social media mentions of the ""Fate of the Furious"" before its Thursday's opening, it has failed to surpass the box-office opening sales of Fast and Furious 7. Furious 7 grossed $147.1M on its opening day two years ago while industry estimates now for the ""Fate of the Furious"" aka F8 hit only a modest $74.7M based on the $44M advance ticket sales in China, on the maximum $11M domestic B.O. sales and the $19.7M log abroad Thursday night. Furious 7 took $1.5B worldwide, placing second after Avatar - which made $2.8B, first placer in 2015. The Telegraph said that Furious 7 was faster but less furious but still the film made it because it was the tribute film to the actor who died due to car crash in 2013. It looks like that F7 is hard to be surpassed by F8. Based on West Coast ticket sales alone, F8 made $10.4M Thursday night, another $35.1M on Friday and $45.5M and $32M estimated for Saturday and Sunday, respectively, or a total of $123M. The $123M would be added by $82.2M sales abroad, plus China's separate haul of $64M, resulting to a total of $269.2M for F8 as of Friday. F8's sales on Thursday to Easter weekend show a rather not so furious trend, which is not giving it a momentum to surpass F7 although there high hope is still there that F8 can draw a little tie with F7. The revved-up social media mentions for ""The Fate of the Furious"" days prior the showing reached 412.8M in all social media combined. The official Fast and Furious Facebook page is already past the 60M total as of Thursday night. ""The Fate of the Furious"" topped the social media chatter last week with more than 80,000 new conversations compared 26,000 conversations of Disney-Marvel's ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2"", according to media-measurement firm comScore and its PreAct service. In a review of the New York Times, F8 still evokes a ""lingering existential crisis created by Mr. Walker's death "" as ""do the tears that fall in the story"" even as the movie does what is expected, with its fantastic car chases and its assorted machines and locales.

? THE SUNDAY POST   is a weekly wrap-up feature hosted by Kimba at the  CAFFEINATED BOOK REVIEWER . 
TELL ME TUESDAY LAST. NOW. NEXT 
One post, guess why... I broke my new Kindle! I am waiting for Baz to give me the purchase info because he ordered it with his student two day shipping. I want to try and get them to replace it. I was pulling a label off a storage container and my hand slipped and I bonked it with my elbow, not very hard, and the whole top of the screen is black now. It should not be that easy to damage it, but I am sure they will still tell me it isn't covered because it was my neglect. ? ? ? At first it was semi okay because I could still access things on the bottom of the screen and could reply to comments on my blog, and comment on blogs I could find links for at the bottom of pages. I was even able to play my audiobooks from the bottom half of the library screen, but it did one of the Kindle Fire ""known problems"" and spontaneously shut down and disconnected from the wifi. To reconnect to the wifi I need to access the top of the screen, so now Igor is totally useless. ? ? ? I was expecting to get more blogging done on my laptop because I was off work this week for the holidays, but my boss changed our filing service and I was having to mess around with that and get it up and running for next week. I can only manage sitting at the computer for so long, so blogging will be sporadic until I get a new Kindle. I don't want to buy another one until I see if Amazon will replace the broken one. ? ? ? Thank goodness I have my faithful little grey 1st generation Kindle e-reader to read my ARCs on, and I figured out how to download my audiobooks. for my Audiobook Boom reviews, to my laptop. 
April had her baby! It is a beautiful healthy boy. There are videos of the birth and first steps on the ANIMAL ADVENTURES Facebook PAGE . The Canniff Curse was in full effect because after watching from five am yesterday (I set an alarm because the vet said labor was to be expected within 24 hours), I ran to the bathroom and back and she had pushed the baby out while I was gone! Then I thought that was okay because I would still be able to see it stand for the first time... nope, I bent over to grab the cord to plug the laptop in and while I was doing this, well, you guessed it. Ha ha.  There were a lot of people complaining about the paid alert app and the baby name voting, but all of it has gone to giraffe conservation, the Animal Adventures charity for people with seriously ill children (their baby daughter has a rare form of epilepsy and they wanted to help others with out of pocket expenses), and funds to build the park's new welcome and education center. These people live very modestly because they put most of their money towards the park and conservation efforts. It was very disheartening to see an article on Mashable saying they had an inside scoop that the baby was dead and everyone was being lied to to keep the money rolling in. They dissuaded a lot of people from contributing to conservation efforts for no reason other than clickbait for their stupid e-zine. I left a nasty comment on Mashable's Twitter celebratory announcement of of the birth. I will never click on a Mashable link again. I hope you will consider the same.

Baseball has never been sexier in an all-new novel by New York Times Bestselling Author, K. Bromberg. Easton Wylder is baseball royalty. The game is his life. His passion. His everything . So, when an injury threatens to end Easton’s season early, the team calls in renowned physical therapist, Doc Dalton, to oversee his recovery. Except it’s not Doc who greets Easton for his first session, but rather, his daughter, Scout. She may be feisty, athletic, defiant, and gorgeous, but Easton is left questioning whether she has what it takes to help him. Scout Dalton’s out to prove a female can handle the pressure of running the physical therapy regimen of an MLB club. And that proof comes in the form of getting phenom Easton Wylder back on the field. But getting him healthy means being hands-on. And with a man as irresistible as Easton, being hands-on can only lead to one thing, trouble . Because the more she touches him, the more she wants him, and she can’t want him . Not when it’s her job to maintain the club’s best interest, in regards to whether he’s ready to play. But when sparks fly and fine lines are crossed, can they withstand the heat, or is one of them bound to get burned?

REVIEW 
I just recently started getting into K. Bromberg's books again and I'm kicking myself for wandering away for so long. This was yet another excellent read by her and I was really impressed with the depth of emotion it was able to evoke. The Player is not your typical fluffy sports romance, but doesn't have an overtly angsty tone either. It was the perfect balance of romance, heat, and witty humor. 


Easton is the cocky golden boy of baseball, yet not obnoxiously so. He's filled with confidence, and an abundance of energy and magnetism and he isn't afraid to use it to his advantage. What he isn't prepared for is to be assigned to the new trainer who immediately puts him in his place and sees past his star power. After getting injured, the pressure is on for him to return to his position in the time allotted to him, or his career may be in jeopardy. However, no one's expectations are as high as his father, baseball legend Cal Wylder.

Easton and Cal's relationship is one of the main points of conflict. Living in his father's shadow is not a comfortable place to be, and fighting for his father's respect seems to be a losing battle. Though he is gifted at the game, works relentlessly to improve himself, and gives everything he has, he always seems to come up short in his father's eyes. This feeling of inadequacy has leaked into the love of the game until he's started to wonder whether he's playing for the right reasons anymore. 

It’s fucking beautiful. A blessing and a curse. My pleasure and my pain. The only thing I’ve ever known. The only thing I’ve ever wanted to do. 


I really sympathized with Easton. His father wasn't necessarily mean spirited, but selfish and unable to open up to his son. And it definitely seemed to me that there is more going on underneath the surface with his father that hopefully will come to light in the following book. 

Scout Dalton is a no nonsense woman who doesn't pull any punches. But Easton has her rattled and running scared very quickly. The instant attraction and desire he makes her feel is overwhelming and unwanted. Her one focus and priority needs to be getting him back in fine physical shape and back in the game. For more reasons than she's willing to share with anyone. Quietly suffering and with no one to turn to, it hasn't been easy to put up the strong front. 

But with Easton, they seem to slide into a natural and comforting dynamic without even trying. Add onto that their passionate, off the charts, combustible heat? Suddenly Eason's game involves a lot more than the one on the field. He's determined to gain Scout's time, her trust, and most importantly, her heart.

I’m putting myself out on a limb for a woman who wants to run, when for the life of me, I’ve never been one to stay. But I’m not going anywhere. 


I absolutely loved this couple together. Easton was firm and decisive in his resolve to make her his. And Scout was tough, intelligent, and a strong heroine that could hold her own against anyone. I appreciated the lack of unnecessary drama from their secret relationship. I was a little worried that would crop up, but thankfully not. There is a cliffhanger at the end, so be prepared. It wasn't a horribly uncomfortable one, but be aware that everything will be revealed and come to a conclusion in the final installment, The Catch, in June. 

If you love sports romance, this is a must read. The characters are well thought out and engaging, the storyline fast paced and sensual. I'm really looking forward to seeing how this couple finds their HEA in the conclusion.

Contact: Coming Up In The May Online Hotel Business Review Feature Focus Eco-Friendly Practices: The Value of Sustainability The hotel industry continues to make remarkable progress in implementing sustainability policies and procedures in their properties throughout the world. As a result, they continue to reap the benefits of increased profitability, enhanced guest experiences, and improved community relations. In addition, as industry standards are codified and adopted worldwide, hotels can now compare how their operations measure up against their competitors in terms of sustainable practices and accomplishments. This capacity to publicly compare and contrast is spurring competition and driving innovation as hotels do not wish to be left behind in this area. Water management and conservation is still a primary issue as population growth, urbanization, pollution and wasteful consumption patterns place increasing demands on freshwater supply. Water recycling; installing low-flow fixtures; using digital sensors to control water usage; and even harvesting rainwater are just a few things that some hotels are doing to preserve this precious resource. Waste management is another major concern. Through policies of reduce, reuse and recycle, some hotels are implementing ?zero-waste? programs with the goal of substantially reducing their landfill waste which produces carbon dioxide and methane gases. Other hotels have established comprehensive training programs that reinforce the value of sustainability. There is employee engagement through posters and quizzes, and even contests are held to increase innovation, sensitivity and environmental awareness. Some hotels are also monitoring a guest?s energy usage and rewarding those who consumed less energy with gifts and incentives. The May issue of the Hotel Business Review will document how some hotels are integrating eco-friendly practices into their operations and how they and the environment are benefiting from them.

Last week, I started a review of many of the new features in the Creators Update , including gaming enhancements, app throttling, paint 3D, virtual reality, privacy dashboard, windows update improvements, and Cortana changes. 
Here are a few more new features: 
Night light 
Simply put, this is a night shift mode for Windows 10 that tones down the blue light that emits from a screen. This comes in handy when using a device at night, putting less strain on eyes when reading. 
Ebooks 
One very welcome feature is the ability to read ebook formats like EPUB straight from the Edge web browser. You will be able to customize font sizes, and Cortana will be at hand to assist with word lookups. Creators Update also brings about a dedicated ebook section in the Windows Store. 
Edge additions 
Microsoft Edge, the web browser, also comes with subtle improvements. There is a new chevron located on the right of tabs that pops open a bar that contains rich visual previews of each tab. This can be scrolled through with touch, touchpad or mouse. Edge also gets a new set aside tabs feature, which basically stashes all open tabs for recollecting later. Another notable change that Microsoft has made is making Flash content click-to-run. 
Users can also launch InPrivate windows on Edge straight from the jump list in the taskbar. There is support for Microsoft Wallet in Edge, and thanks to the Payment Request API, the browser stores your payment and shipping preferences to make online purchases fast and easy. 
Microsoft also bills the Edge web browser as a portal for interacting with 3D digital content while wearing a HoloLens headset. 
Start menu folders 
This might wind up being real useful for heavy users of the Start menu. Starting with the Windows 10 Creators Update, you will be able to drag your Start menu apps on top of each other to create folders that expand when selected. 
Better theme support 
The Creators Update packs enhanced options for people that want to customize the look of their PCs. It moves theme control into the Personalization section of the Settings app, and users can now choose theme accents from the entire color spectrum, as opposed to a handful of predefined options. Windows will actually warn you if you choose a color combination that is difficult to read! 
Microsoft is also offering users the ability to download and buy new themes from the Windows Store, and although the selection is small right now, it is sure to improve as time goes by. 
Windows Defender overhaul 
A complete overhaul. Windows Defender, the default antivirus app part of Windows 10, has received a fresh new coat of paint in the Creators Update that brings with it new scanning options along with reports on the health and performance of your PC. 
Defender also adds a nuclear option. A link to Refresh your PC that reinstalls and updates your computer, wiping most of the applications, but keeping personal files and settings intact. This option was hidden away deep down in Settings previously, but could come in handy if a nasty malware infects your PC. 
Handoff 
This is the ability to jump from device to device. Apple already has this continuity feature in its ecosystem that lets users pick up where they left off with files on other Apple devices, and now Microsoft is embracing this functionality. Cortana combines with the Action Center here to allow you to switch computers. 
When switching devices, quick links to any websites you were browsing in Edge on other PCs will be displayed in the Action Center, along with links to any cloud based documents that you were working on. The functionality is somewhat limited right now, but future improvements are expected. 
Dynamic Lock 
This is something that could benefit business users immensely. Microsoft internally calls this feature Windows Goodbye, and it basically automatically locks your PC when you walk away. Think of Dynamic Lock as the reverse of Windows Hello. 
Power slider 
This is something that probably not all users will get, as Microsoft has said that it will be working with OEMs to determine the best settings for their customers so that they can ship this new functionality on new Windows 10 PCs. 
The idea here is to allow users the ability to adjust the power performance of their device, thanks to a new Power Mode slider in the battery section. You will be able to crank it up to full when you need more oomph, or dial it down if you do not need as much computing firepower in order to increase battery life. Again, only select devices will be getting this, but it is a neat little improvement. 
Settings improvements 
The Setting apps in Windows 10 are now the hub of new additions to the operating system. Creators Update tweaks things around a bit, and shows all devices connected to your PC in one centralized location — from mouse to keyboard to peripherals like the Surface Pen. No longer will you have to scour through various submenus and panels to find all the information on your PC hardware. 
Business features 
While professionals and enterprise users will find many of the new features in the Creators Update welcome additions, there are a few that specifically cater to the business crowd. Like the ability to block installation of Win32 software programs. 
Another is streamlined support for virtual private networks, VPNs, that makes it possible to easily activate a connection without opening your network connections. This is, once Windows, knows your VPN credentials. 
There is also a new Quick Create option that makes it easy to deploy Hyper-V virtual machines. 
And this is just a brief summary of the new features!

Michael Wolraich's Unreasonable Men is an engaging exercise in political map making, following the fashions of the times with the entrenched interests of every year. The period in this case is the turn to the 20th century up to pre-WWI America, when her social development lagged significantly behind her economic success, but I found myself wishing for similar vignettes in other ages and historical climes. It's not the most weighty of tomes - finished in 1 day - but I'm not alone in not having time for say Carl Sandburg's 6-volume set on Lincoln - Unreasonable Men is more in the spirit of Hamilton, the Musical - a theater piece you can enjoy and put down, though revert to and contemplate with pleasure. 
Unreasonable Men is a multi-tragedy combined with a soothing but ironic ultimate success - the one we all kind of know about, the America Made Great Yet Again. But the proof is in the details, not in any assured outcomes, and Michael provides those details. Aside from the figures we know or kind of know - Roosevelt, Taft, a bit of Wilson, J.P. Morgan, Vanderbilt and early cro-Rockefeller clan - there are the Congressional and business characters usually well forgotten after their period shelf-life. And this part of the tale is the most worth remembering - the bipartisan logjam of entrenched power controlling the sausage making. There are no accidents in this factory - it's a well-run machine producing an exact product to specification, whatever the occasion. There's an assuredness to the actors' certainty of what is and what should be, born in the conceit of the scientific marvels of the late 19th Century driving progress with seemingly no brakes. But like Casey Jones' famous locomotive, speed and haste portend more than a safe arrival, and America's trains built on fealty to the robber barons is soon to come apart at the seams. 
To not give away the good parts, the core issue at play is America's tariff system, the sole serious means for government to raise money at that time and the playing field for most that was corrupt. But the book highlights the increasing political and personal divides in the new century - the conquest of the West completed, the people turning to more basic and mundane but fragmented wants. Nothing unites a country like a shared goal, and nothing divides it like that goal completed. 
At the heart of this book's heroic journey is Bob LaFollette, a quixotic character from then ""out west"" Wisconsin who discovers somewhat early on that he wants to help people, and doesn't seem that intent on playing the game as intended. He's not a grand chess master - his play seems to look 2-3 steps ahead where most people see only the gotcha enticements of 1 - but his playing is good enough to keep him going into the big leagues. If this were a novel - and you have to keep pinching yourself to remind that it's not - there'd be one primary evil foil. But in the pattern of America's shifting alliances, characters like Roosevelt provide a powerful ally and enemy at once, just as the Senate and House and party leaders provide a palpable enough villain. Even JP Morgan's appearance is more benign than malignant, though it serves to show part of what's wrong with this supremely patronistic system. While LaFollette is billed as the ""won't take no for an answer"" type, he's surprisingly reasonable in his ambitions - focused on digestible mouthfuls moreso than swallowing the whole hog, but insistent on those mouthfuls, along with (at least in retrospect) attuned to obvious needs rather than unhinged demands, and that reasonableness in a time of undistributed plenty and seemingly unbreakable agreements makes him a dark horse to root for. He's not a Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington type in the sense that this isn't a movie - his ardor and persuasion has to be carried across his rise as Congressman, Governor, Senator and short-lived Presidential aspirant against real foes and obstacles. 
Lincoln Steffens and the budding socially conscious news media (in contrast to the Hearst/Pulitzer-style yellow journalism of the previous decade) provide a useful messaging outlet in those telegraph-and-sparse-telephone days, and it's heartening to see them skeptically persuaded rather than bought by the growing populist furor, even though the press plays its usual fickle role between strings pulled from behind the set and the drive for sensation from the (as Michael helpfully defines) ""muck rakers"". 
Aside from the political foils, the backdrop is the collegiate setting of the well-heeled - the Long Island clan we know from high school's The Great Gatsby, but a step earlier in its development - when that wealth was created amidst the self-assurance of the rail and coal and electricity boom and land grabs out West, when train and ocean travel became the connective tissue of that generation's jet set - and indeed, half of the book mentions this or that character off on an enviable 6-week to 3-month vacation. Wolraich's description isn't roman-à-clef - it's more utilitarian, a bit like mug shots or quick snaps to identify the usual suspects - but it's sufficient to get us involved and identified with a scene we thought we knew enough about, but was much more involved and transformational than that overlooked in Civics class (and at last we get some inside skinny on those 4 turn-of-the-century amendments that snuck in after a 40 year drought). 
These are not smiling people - they're earnest and hard-charging in that Teddy Roosevelt we do likely glimpse, my way or the highway, but even there, Wolraich's descriptions and dredged out historical references bring more nuance and understanding to the well-trod character, and that nuance makes Roosevelt's role in this tragedy much less predictable and more engaging as the plot develops. There are some gaps in the mosaic - New York's sweatshops and the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist fire would have fit in well with the budding outrage that drove the new ""progressivism"" that LaFollette introduced, while women, even the suffragettes, play a quite minor role as was usual for the time - but the book foremost is about Washington and its inner workings and how that changed - not any particular piece to the puzzle. 
And in that regard, Unreasonable Men is instructive as well as retrospective - a reminder that the wheels can come off at any time, not just with the big wars, but the tense moments of the Panic of 1907, and how the most prepared can take advantage of these shock points in history. It's also ultimately optimistic in its outlook, how the system eventually won - at least in values the progressive left would acclaim - even as most of the players go down in defeat. In the original 1972 movie Rollerball, John Houseman proclaims, ""no man is bigger than the game itself, Jonathan"" - and as this chapter of America unfolds, the game, not the house, is the winner. Well done, Wolraich - bully.

0,Nightdragon (noreply@blogger.com),2017-04-16T09:18:36.000+03:00,[],,,english,0,2017-04-16T09:18:36.000+03:00,,"I guess we can now call them the Trumpbots. 
The people for whom the great Jerry Williams used to say, ""they're out there!"" The ones who could listen to Trump announce that he was going to declare himself king of the universe with George Soros as his deputy and say, ""U ... yeah. Sure! Well done, Mr. President! America First!"" 
The ones who apparently are so firmly attached to the President's caboose that they absolutely cannot hear anything that doesn't blindly support their guy. Trump's been doing a lot lately that makes me wonder how America will be made great again, but these folks don't want to know. 
Even the Obamabots, at least during his first term, were willing to call out the Dear Leader. Remember in 2011 when Matt Damon was asked about him, to which the Mass-hole actor sadly shook his head, sighed and replied, ""Not a fan."" The Obama butt-kissers, including Damon, soon stepped back into line during his second administration—after all, what could they possibly have not liked?—but when Barry failed to completely bring the hammer of soft socialist dictatorship down on the ""bitter clingers"" before 2012, they spoke up. I've said it before and I'll say it again, at least you know where you are with the Left. 
The Trumpbots, however? Stick your fingers in your ears, a blindfold over your eyes and use your mouth only to shout down the ""alt-right"" when it rightly expresses concern over the path down which your man is headed. Just sit there like dopes, praise everything he does and question nothing. That's brilliant, folks. What a gang of geniuses. We should be inclined to leave democracy in your hands? 
Trump is infinitely better than Hillary the Pantsuit. We have Jeff Sessions as Attorney General and Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. The coal industry has been given a new lease on life and some bureaucratic red tape has been cut. Some jobs have been created and the economy has responded with an uptick. Hell, if this keeps up, Standard and Poor's may give the U.S. back its AAA credit rating. Things are okay. There are green shoots springing up from the decaying matter of the last eight years. 
But, listen to me, fellow Trumpsters: You knew the deal. You were aware that he had to be held to his word—by us . You cannot allow yourselves to be so taken in by his aura that you will not question him because you think that's unpatriotic. You have to question those you support. Or else, you risk supporting a cult of personality and nothing more. 
Fifteen years ago, I was totally taken in by the rah-rah jingoism of the Iraq War. Saddam Hussein was a bad dude, he had weapons of mass destruction, and, if we searched hard enough, there was probably a link to 9/11 with his regime as well. We had to free the Iraqi people and bestow Jeffersonian democracy on them. Bush, Bush, U.S.A., U.S.A.! I ate that shit up—hook, line and sinker. And now? Oh, what kind of fool was I? 
I now loathe the neocons who brought us that war (among so many others). I despise the jingoistic yellow journalism behind ""Remember the Maine"" and the My Lai massacre. Another conspiracy by the internationalists to keep us mired  in a conflict that keeps the war machine churning. As for Dubya, I now cringe at the thought of ever having had that idiot's back. He was just another tool of the global establishment. He promised us in 2000 to keep out of foreign entanglements, and then dropped us in two of them. There was some justification for action in Afghanistan albeit, but we should have got out once we shot every Taliban member out of that tree they were in, and not get bogged down like the Soviets circa 1979. 
Bush voters did not hold him to account. In fact, they put him in for a second term. Granted, his opposition was Pepé Le Pew, a.k.a. John Kerry. Still, the ""U.S.A! U.S.A!"" chants started getting old; obscene, in fact, given the flag-draped coffins that started to multiply. 
The lesson we should all have learned? Fight only when we're attacked. Have a massive, well-trained military with plenty of air and sea power on reserve for times when it is genuinely required to defend the homeland. Let's try living as a nation of peace for once and leave the rest of the world to it. 
A great place to start is to recognize that avenging the babies of the ""sarin"" gas attack in Syria is not going to save the whole world. Children die everywhere, it's a grim fact of life. From a metaphysical standpoint, death is death. Why don't we lob a few Tomahawk missiles at Vatican City for the Children's Crusade of 1212? Even better, what about declaring war on the police force of Rio de Janiero for the 1993 Candelaria child massacre ? Hey, the deaths of sixty young 'uns still need avenging, don'tcha know! Don't you care about the children ? 
In fact, among the worst contemporary massacres involving children are the Beslan School attack in 2004 which killed 156 children, the 2014 Peshawar Public School attack in Pakistan that killed 100 children, the Baghlani-jadid factory massacre in Afganistan in 2007 that took out 61 children, and the attack on the Yazidi community in Iraq by ISIS last year and by al-Qaeda in 2007, death toll numbers for which have not been provided but are thought to have wiped out scores of children. All of these attacks committed by ...? Yep, radical Islamists. And we attack Assad's secular regime and take a hard line against Russia, the nuclear superpower we were promised vastly improved relations with by the new President. 
So, people, I don't want to hear any more about ""the children"". I'm sorry to say it, but it's immaterial. And here's the thing: I'm still waiting for the proof that Assad committed the gas attack in Idlib province, and that the gas was even sarin. If you look at the health workers tending to the children after the attack, you will see that they're only wearing gloves and dust masks. Those alone would not have saved them from the effects of sarin—just sayin'.  Were the more scientifically agile among us not supposed to notice this? 
By the way, a car bomb exploded west of Aleppo on Saturday, killing 24 people who were being moved as part of the ""Syrian swap,"" arranged by the Syrian government and the opposition to evacuate people from towns and cities that have been besieged for years. I suppose Assad whipped this up too, even though suicide bombings are the hallmark of Islamic terrorists in the Middle East? Who's your next bomb going to hit, Mr. President? I certainly hope it'll take out more than just 94 ISIS militants as with your MOAB strike in Afghanistan. Now, 940— then we're talking business. 
But enough about that. Let's have a quick review of some of the other bewildering moves by Trump lately and the wackiness of his administration, discounting the previous health care and travel ban disasters: 

He has reversed his position on the Import-Export bank, one the biggest corporate welfare rackets operating, in which only the biggest companies benefit. (And we all need Facebook and Google and Amazon to be even more powerful than they already are, don't we?) NATO, that anachronism, was declared by Trump to be ""no longer obsolete"". China will not be declared a currency manipulator. This, despite Trump having talked about this since the 1980s. Chief advisor Steve Bannon was publicly dressed down by Trump while Jared Kushner is seemingly taking the lead in almost every committee meeting. James Comey won't be persuaded to step down as head of the F.B.I. and will not pursue ""locking her up,"" that is, throwing Hillary Clinton in prison where she belongs. And if he won't put Hillary away, Susan Rice probably won't be doing the perp walk anytime soon as well. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer embarrasses himself and the educational reputation of the United States by claiming that ""Ashad"" is worse than Hitler because the Nazi leader did not use chemical weapons. When asked to clarify this by a member of the press, Spicer noted that indeed Hitler brought gas into ""the Holocaust center,"" but not deliver chemical attacks from a plane. This bumbling idiot is the best Trump can do for his White House Press Secretary, especially when he could have Laura Ingraham in that role? Nicky Haley, our ambassador to the United Nations, as Michelle Bachmann-like a boob as you can get, says that ISIS is ""obviously"" the problem, but justifies regime change in Syria [ OK, so I lied about ""enough of that"" ]. Trump has nominated a partner at Mayer Brown, a global legal services provider including advising on trade and visas and work placement for migrants, and former Dubya Bush administration member as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's number 2 guy at the State Department. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos told illegal alien students that they ""should not be concerned"" about losing in-state tuition. In saying this, DeVos parroted Homeland Security leader John Kelly who said last month that, ""the least of my worries right now is anyone who falls under the general category of DACA"" and also ""the least of my worries are undocumented illegal aliens who are living lives."" On that subject, the Department of Homeland Security has suspended its sanctuary cities list, alleging the inaccuracy of some of the data used to produce it. In other words, the threat to pull federal funding from municipalities sheltering illegal law-breakers, if that's not a redundancy, is being challenged and, as always, the principled position is taking a back seat to social justice radicalism. So they had to ... uh, you know, ""suspend the list"". Where are the tax cuts Americans were promised? When will the tax plan Trump laid out during his candidacy be implemented? When will that wall start getting built? When will Trump call that quisling Paul Ryan out for betraying conservative principles by not crafting a budget that will include tax cuts and funding for the border wall? 
Incidentally, dear reader, remember how I recently asked  if Devan Nunes, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence chairman, would recuse himself regarding the investigation into whether the Obama administration spied on Trump, for which evidence was found and he was excoriated by the Democrats and the media for not first going to Democrat hack Adam Schiff with it? Let me claim to have been among the first to foresee this. I wrote the entry April 2, and Nunes recused himself on April 6. I called it, mes amis . I called it. 
I'll tell you what. Maybe we've been snookered here, Trump fans. Did this dude just pull the mother of all arts of the deal on us? If Donald Trump is the Archie Bunker that the nation's deplorables elected, he's been spending too much time listening to Mike and Gloria, in this case, Jared and Ivanka, than following the desires of the base that got him where he is. 
This president needs to start listening to us now and put a halt to all the reversals and policy shifts that he and his cabinet have been engaging in. And he needs you , my dear little Trumpsters, to hold him to account. 
Don't be a Trumpbot. Support the original Trump message of ""America First"". Call me crazy, but cozying up to the Wall St. crowd, calling for Middle Eastern regime change and stalling action on illegals is not the nationalist, American citizens über alles protocol that I voted for.

Two years ago, I lost my job and have been looking for a new one with little luck. I started looking into to work-at-home opportunities. The idea of saving money on gas and avoiding traffic fast food lunches sounded like a brilliant idea. I am looking at the option of becoming a transcriptionist and I like how the author laid out the book, as she speaks of her own experience of starting out and staying positive and being persistent. She maps out everything you need to know to get started, including required skills, equipment you will need, pay rates, and a plethora of tips and tricks that will help you get started. I have found that there are a lot of transcription job opportunities out there, and many of them you do not need a certificate or degree, just impeccable time management, listening and typing skills. This book will give you step-by-step instructions on how to get transcription jobs, where to get them, creating your resume and so much more. Great book at a great price!

Chris Toth was among the athletes honored at the Salute to the Champions banquet Feb. 21 at the Town and Country Hotel in San Diego. 
The San Diego Hall of Champions’ annual banquet honors the previous year’s professional, amateur, and high school stars of the month as well as stars of the year and inductees into the Breitbard Hall of Fame. 
Toth, who graduated from Fallbrook High School in 2007 and is currently the primary goalkeeper for the San Diego Sockers, was recognized for his January 2016 Professional Star of the Month award. 
“It’s cool being honored in San Diego,” said Toth. “It’s always a special thing.” 
Toth faced 125 shots during January 2016 and saved 92 of those. The Sockers ended that month with a three-game winning streak, and Toth made 62 saves during those three games. 
“It’s well deserved,” said Sockers coach Phil Salvagio. 
A selection committee at the Hall of Champions studies statistics and achievements. In addition to collecting statistics, Hall of Champions staff members speak with coaches and athletic directors in the case of high school athletes, to obtain recommendations. 
The awards committee reviews the lists of recommendations to select the stars of the month. Toth, San Antonio Spurs and former San Diego State University basketball player Kahwi Leonard, and Michael Sgarbossa of the American Hockey League’s San Diego Gulls were the three Professional Star of the Month recipients for January 2016.

If you've ever thought, hey, someone should open a serious sushi restaurant inside a Georgian townhouse, you'll find exactly that at Dinings. A dedicated sushi counter’s been shoehorned inside what would be the hallway, and there’s a pokey sit-down restaurant downstairs. It isn’t the most comfortable place to sit, but it’s worth the trouble for some of London’s best sushi, which does both classics and new-school dishes very well. The lunchtime sushi sets and chirashi are a great deal, as you’ll find the best stuff - even o-toro - mixed in there for the relative bargain of £25. For dinner, Dinings is definitely one for the sushi enthusiasts, as a serious bill can rack up very, very quickly.

4:40 p.m.
Japan and the U.S. have outlined a path forward for economic talks between the countries.
The announcement followed an inaugural meeting Tuesday of the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue in Tokyo chaired by visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso.
It said the dialogue would focus on three areas: trade and investment rules and issues, cooperation in macroeconomic policy and specific industry sectors.
The dialogue was set up by President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the Japanese leader's visit to the U.S. in February.

3:40 p.m.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso are kicking off a new U.S.-Japan economic dialogue that was launched during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's meeting with President Donald Trump in the U.S. in February.
As talks began Tuesday, Aso said the U.S.-Japan alliance has underpinned peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and that trade friction with the U.S. has given way to an ""age of cooperation.""
Pence said Trump sees the talks as a way to improve business ties with Japan and is hoping for quick results. The discussions are to focus on economic and structural policy and trade and investment strategies aimed at strengthening both countries' economies.

2:15 p.m.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese leaders have begun talks expected to focus largely on trade with America's anchor ally in the region, though tensions with North Korea loomed large.
Pence reassured Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday that the U.S. considers its alliance with Japan to be a cornerstone of security in the region.
Pence said, ""We appreciate the challenging times in which the people of Japan live with increasing provocations from across the Sea of Japan.""
He also said, ""We are with you 100 percent,"" adding that the U.S. always seeks peace.
Abe said Japan hoped for peaceful dialogue with Pyongyang, ""but at the same time, dialogue for the sake of dialogue is valueless and it is necessary for us to exercise pressure North Korea so that it comes forward and engages in this serious dialogue.""
Pence was having lunch with Abe at the prime minister's official residence after arriving in Japan earlier in the day for the second stop of a 10-day Asia tour.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has arrived in Japan for the second stop of a 10-day Asia tour.
His plane touched down Tuesday at the U.S. military's Atsugi base outside Tokyo.
The focus of his trip is expected to shift in Japan to trade. North Korea's nuclear and missile development dominated the agenda on his first stop in South Korea.
Pence told business leaders before leaving Seoul that the Trump administration is reviewing all trade agreements as part of its ""America First"" policy.

The Rise and Fall of the Meritocracy (Radio 4) | iPlayer
There has been a lot of social media distress at the demise of Radio 4’s Saturday Review . Its replacement – a selection of Front Row highlights – is not cutting it for the show’s many fans, who enjoy Saturday Review ’s round-table-many-voices format, the contributors’ insights and the exemplary presentation skills of Tom Sutcliffe. It does seem sad. Since Tony Hall took over at the head of the BBC, there has been a Corporation shunt away from a journalistic approach to culture towards a practitioner justification of it. Right from the start, Hall said he wanted to “showcase more of the incredible talent that this country has to offer” – which is great, except showcasing is all we get. The Review Show is no more. Night Waves went years ago. The Culture Show was decommissioned. And now, bye bye Saturday Review .
Instead, the BBC offers us programmes where we witness art (beautifully shot performances or festivals; easy-watching shows on painting or pop), or we witness artists talking to other artists. Such shows are entertaining but they are not analytical. Whether it’s Grayson Perry chatting to Naomi Alderman on Radio 4 (great), Michael Palin meeting Jan Morris (not bad) or When Corden Met Barlow (hmm), it’s all celebration and celebrity. No critique. No debate. No argument. Ah, well. The arts have always been subject to whimsical trends within the BBC. Perhaps this is just the one we are in at the moment.

We are also, apparently, in a moment of meritocracy, and last week Radio 4 offered us two programmes on the subject. Toby Young’s The Rise and Fall of the Meritocracy , which I’ll come to, and Hashi Mohamed’s Adventures in Social Mobility . Mohamed came to the UK from Somalia when he was nine. He grew up in a three-bedroomed house that had 18 people in it, scored fairly average GCSEs, but then turned himself around in his early 20s to become a beautifully spoken, successful barrister. His story is inspiring but, as he admitted, it’s also atypical. “Does my story say something about upward mobility,” he wondered, “or the barriers to it?”
This programme offered insight into the difficulties that ordinary people must overcome in order to succeed. It’s not just the grades – the grades are achievable – it’s what one contributor called a “cultural connectedness”. If you join a law chambers, you may well stay there for years (I didn’t know this), so when you’re being considered for pupillage, your interviewer is thinking: “Do I want this person as my colleague for the rest of my professional life?” No wonder they stick with what or who they know.
Mohamed encouraged young people from outsider backgrounds to tell their stories to get on. But, said one, revealing too much of myself would make me feel vulnerable. (You note that the elite don’t have to do this.) And what if your story is less striking than Mohamed’s? Would anyone care? Should the ordinary person change to fit in, or the professions change to fit the ordinary person?

Mohamed’s programme packed a lot in. Toby Young’s didn’t get quite so much, but it tried. He took the premise of meritocracy (a term coined by his dad, Michael , who was a Labour peer) and told us it did the opposite of what we think it does. Instead of allowing clever working-class people to progress, it keeps the elite up there. Young believes that if you are born to privilege then not only does your environment push you towards success but, also, your brains do. Your elite genes mean you are cleverer.
This is not an argument that everyone agrees with, and many of his contributors, including Oliver James and Michael Sandel , took him to task. Perhaps it was my addled liberal brain, but I couldn’t quite work out where Young stood within his analysis. He predicted that “the disenfranchised masses” would boil over and “the liberal world order will be swept away”. (Hence Brexit and Trump.) But, other than “readjustment”, he didn’t offer many alternative ideas.

Photo: Joshua Roberts/@Darth/Reuters Steve Bannon is a devout Catholic who believes in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. But it’s the story of Christ’s descent into hell that occupies his mind most this Easter weekend.
The embattled chief strategist to President Donald Trump is a student of Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich, a 19th-century nun and German mystic whose visions, documented in The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ , served as inspiration for The Passion of the Christ, the 2003 film by Mel Gibson (who, incidentally, Bannon once reportedly tried to work with on a movie about, among other things, Adolf Hitler and eugenics).
In that book, in a chapter favored by Bannon, this is how Emmerich describes hell: “All in this dreary abode tends to fill the mind with horror; not a word of comfort is heard or a consoling idea admitted; the one tremendous thought, that the justice of an all-powerful God inflicts on the damned nothing but what they have fully deserved, is the absorbing tremendous conviction which weighs down each heart.” Those poor souls in hell are notable not for their misfortune, but for their deservedness. (Coincidentally, I’m sure, Emmerich also predicts that Lucifer will be “unchained for a time fifty or sixty years before the year of Christ 2000”; Trump was born fifty-four years before, in 1946.)
Likewise in the White House, where Bannon has endured a cinematic and enthusiastically documented fall in recent weeks, there is a sense that he made his own dismal fate. “All of his problems today are of his own making,” one source with knowledge of the latest West Wing drama told me of Bannon. “Whether Bannon is gone or not is an open question. Whether he’s neutered? He’s neutered. There was a time he had influence. His influence has waned.”
Media reports have not been subtle in characterizing Bannon’s political future. The New York Times branded him “ doomed ” while Politico planned his funeral (while also predicting a “revenge saga”). But as with all things Trump, the truth may be at once less and more predictable than that. “You’re always up and down with Trump,” another source said. “There’s always gonna be a favorite.”
Trump is dissatisfied and looking to assign blame for a first 100 days in office defined by humiliation and defeat, according to half a dozen sources I’ve spoken to in recent days. At any given moment, what irks him might be the death of the health-care bill, or the early misstep on the travel ban, or, perhaps most painfully of all, the old media chatter that Bannon is, in the words of Time , “the great manipulator.” Trump attempted to dispel the latter perception last week in a remark to the New York Post, denying Bannon credit for the election victory against Hillary Clinton (“I’m my own strategist”). “There was obviously residual lagging effects for all the press that Steve got,” another source said. Trump mentioned to the Post an ominous threat to “straighten out” tensions between Bannon and the presumably untouchable Jared Kushner. Bannon also might be paying the price for press Trump believes, accurately or not, Bannon engineered: “He thinks Steve was leaking against Jared and Ivanka,” the source said. “If I was trying to fuck Steve? That’s what I would do.”
White House sources tell me the ideological split with Kushner is real but not quite the point — Bannon’s primary “ gunfight ” is with economic adviser Gary Cohn, a longtime Democrat whose influence has ballooned as Bannon has fallen out of favor with the president. The Goldman Sachs alums — Bannon was an investment banker there in the ’80s, Cohn was the COO until earlier this year — can comfortably “shoot the shit,” but mutual suspicion looms beneath the superficial friendliness. “Look, in all honesty? Steve has said things to me about Gary,” a source close to Bannon told me. “He’s never said one thing to me derogatory about Jared.”
“The president has started his love affair with Gary,” another source said, “Gary’s not aware of this: That love affair will end abruptly. Gary Cohn will step on a landmine.”
Many sources believe Bannon’s “fatal mistake” was choosing to stay out of early, top-tier hiring disputes, focusing instead on his big picture, anti-globalist agenda. But now Bannon stands alone — a self-styled radical seated at the table with ideological opponents Kushner and Cohn, who haven’t similarly been blamed for the turmoil of the first 100 days. Even White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, a natural ally to Bannon, has been working more closely with Kushner recently, a source said.
Another administration official close to Bannon added, “He’s an intellectual messiah, right? There’s a little bit of a messianic, I’m gonna cure all the ills of the United States — him and Trump are like that together. But what I do think is he’s realizing [that] he needs more allies.”
For his part, Bannon appears to be abiding, if nervously — with the official divulging that he’d been “rocked” by his abrupt change in status with the president, and the uncertainty he now faces.
Trump is, for instance, both prone to nostalgia — recently calling a former aide in the middle of the night to ask his advice on a Tweet — and also deeply unsentimental. “You could play golf with this guy for 40 years, have a heart attack on the ninth hole, he’ll pick up a new golf partner on the tenth hole like nothing happened. He doesn’t give a shit, okay? Doesn’t mean he doesn’t like you,” the official said, adding, “What happens with all these guys is they get very confident in their relationship with Trump and then Trump blasts them. As soon as you think you’re in Trump’s good graces and you start to be at ease and take that for granted, that’s when you get annihilated.”
But fittingly, given the holiday, in this week’s carnage was a miracle of sorts for Bannon. The president, according to multiple sources, has been distracted at least a bit by the military strikes in Syria and Afghanistan as well as his needling of North Korea. “He’s always been enamored of the generals,” a source close to him said. “The more medals you’re wearing on your chest, the more he likes you — that’s a danger.” For someone trying to keep a low profile in the White House, it might seem like welcome cover.

ATLANTA (AP) — Bartolo Colon was having too much fun in his home debut with the Braves to be bothered by a home run in the second inning. 
He had no reason to worry. 
Colon allowed only a hit in seven dominant innings, Brandon Phillips drove in three runs with three hits and Atlanta beat the San Diego Padres 9-2 on Sunday for its fourth straight win. 
""I've always tried to pitch relaxed and be in a good place when it's my turn,"" Colon said through a translator. ""Like I tell everybody, the day it's my turn to pitch is the happiest day of the week for me. I love it. I was just trying to be relaxed and have a good time out there."" 
Colon (1-1) overpowered the Padres as he showed why he was given a $12.5 million, one-year contract in November. 
""He's probably experienced anything and more than all the rest of us in this clubhouse,"" said manager Brian Snitker. ""Nothing bothers him. ... It's refreshing to watch. I love being around the guy."" 
Ryan Schimpf's homer in the second was the only hit allowed by the 43-year-old Colon. The right-hander allowed only one more baserunner — a leadoff walk to Schimpf in the fifth before Hunter Renfroe hit into a double play. Colon had six strikeouts. 
""It's nice having him on our side,"" said Freddie Freeman. ""If he gives up one, that's usually all they're going to get."" 
Manager Andy Green said Padres hitters were ""way too passive"" and took too many fastballs against Colon. 
""Once you let Bartolo get deep in the count, he starts pitches that look like strikes that really aren't,"" Green said. 
The Padres led 1-0 until Tyler Flowers' single drove in Phillips and Adonis Garcia in the fifth. Phillips' one-out single was the first hit allowed by Trevor Cahill (0-2). 
Phillips had a two-run single in the sixth and a run-scoring single in the eighth. Ender Inciarte hit his fourth homer in the seventh. 
A review lasting only 58 seconds reversed the ruling on the field that Atlanta's Dansby Swanson was safe on his grounder to second base in the sixth. Inciarte and Freddie Freeman, who reached on an intentional walk, scored on Phillips' two-out single up that middle that knocked Cahill out of the game. 
Padres left fielder Travis Jankowski may have saved a homer with his catch at the wall of a drive hit by Jace Peterson in the seventh. 
TRAINER'S ROOM 
Padres: RHP Kevin Quackenbush was optioned to Triple-A El Paso to clear a roster spot for Cahill. Quackenbush pitched a scoreless inning against the Braves on Friday in his only appearance after being recalled from El Paso. 
Braves: Flowers left the game with a right hamstring strain and is day to day, according to Snitker. ... OF Matt Kemp (right hamstring tightness) can come off the 10-day DL on Tuesday. 
CAHILL OFF DL 
Cahill, who was activated from the 10-day disabled list before the game, allowed four runs on four hits and three walks in 5 2-3 innings. He went on the DL with a lower back strain on April 6. 
""The back wasn't an issue and I didn't think about it,"" Cahill said. ""I was just trying to match Bartolo out there. They got to me in the later innings, but I felt good."" 
Cahill was hurt by three wild pitches that helped the Braves score two runs in the fifth. 
STREAKING 
Nick Markakis stretched his hitting streak to 10 games with a double off Zach Lee that drove in Freeman from first in the eighth. 
Johan Camargo added a run-scoring single off Christian Bethancourt, who began his career with Atlanta as a catcher, for his first major league hit. 
BOOM OR BUST 
Schimpf, hitting .152, has three homers. He has only two other hits in 33 at-bats. 
UP NEXT 
Padres: RHP Jered Weaver (0-1) will make his third start of the season, all on the road, on Monday night. 
Braves: LHP Jaime Garcia (0-1) is 2-1 with a 2.52 ERA in six career starts against the Padres.

If you own a small business, one of your highest priorities should be the security of your business data. This is something that a lot of people overlook given that they do not have a keen understanding of the related dangers. These professionals fail to take the right precautions for protecting their customers and themselves. Following are several reasons to purchase the small business cyber security Delaware companies are offering.

When a data breach occurs, this can result in serious and costly liability issues for your organization. This is especially true if the confidential payment information of your customers is compromised. These are details that people expect your organization to keep safe when they share them with you. If you cannot deliver on this promise, people may not want to work with your organization in the future.

Businesses that undergo events like these tend to suffer serious damages in terms of their overall reputations. Depending upon just how big these events are, they may even result in a lot of negative press. This is not the type of publicity that a growing brand needs as it can be very detrimental during the formative stages of commercial development.

Not only will you have to pay for public relations support, but you will also find it far more difficult to convert your prospects into paying customers. This can make it harder to maintain consistent profits going forward into the future. You will also have to account for the increased potential for losing formerly loyal clients.

One of the advantages of having a solid security plan is increased continuity for your company. There is little risk of having systems malfunction or crash due to malicious hackers. The best protective strategies are designed to prioritize continuity. This can keep your profits high while allowing you to continue meeting the ongoing demands of your clients.

You may be surprised to find that the most pertinent threat comes from your very own employees. They might not be actively trying to put you at risk, but they may not know how to keep you protected. Their online activities could be leaving open a lot of opportunities for malicious attacks. As such, always be sure to tell your team about how data security is always your foremost concern.

One of the best ways to protect your organization is by investing in appropriate training. This will give all of your workers a keen understanding of the steps they need to take to protect themselves and your organization. As such, any investment that you make in this training is certain to pay for itself by helping you avoid a variety of costly disasters.

You do not want to hand this important task on to an IT professional who lacks a specialty in security. It is far better to only work with individuals who have a keen understanding of the correct protocols for keeping growing companies and their clients and finances safe. These are efforts that will make your organization must less vulnerable to malicious hackers while keeping the sensitive data that you've collected unharmed.

Lyn, do you have a favorite reading genre?
Growing up, I was a big fan of nonfiction, and I still read a lot of nonfiction for adults. But as an author of books for teens, I like to read and write historical and contemporary realistic fiction. I’m supposed to be working on a contemporary middle grade novel right now, so I’m reading more middle grade these days. 
For whom do you think the WTP list is meant?
The list is for everyone! It’s important for young readers to see themselves in books and to know that books and reading are for them. I teach creative writing to ninth graders whose families come from Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Pakistan, and it means a lot to them to see not only stories from the places where their families originated but also authors whose backgrounds are similar to theirs. They come to believe that they too can become writers, and since I told them writers had to read a lot, they’ve now cleaned out my classroom library. 
At the same time, young people need windows to other cultures if they are to become good citizens of the world. We’ve seen the result of ignorance and intolerance in both the U.S. and the U.K., and it will be our young people, with their open minds and open hearts, who can reverse that. For young people who live in communities, especially rural communities, where everyone shares a similar background, books are the principal means of portraying the wider world. 
What are some of the first books you read that excited you about reading?
I was a misfit throughout my school years, and I connected with the bullied and rejected characters of S.E. Hinton’s The Outsiders, who created their own community in the face of their exclusion. Robert Cormier’s The Chocolate War was another story that portrayed the individual standing up to a powerful and corrupt society. Otherwise, most of my reading was nonfiction about cataclysmic events from the past. Among my favorites were the minurte-by-minute historical narratives like Jim Bishop’s The Day Lincoln Was Shot and Walter Lord’s account of the sinking of the Titanic, A Night to Remember. I think I liked them so much because they read like fiction. 
Lyn, do you still read entirely in print or will you read ebooks or audiobooks?
I read mostly in print, which I prefer because I can then share books I like with others. However, I read ebooks when I’m in Portugal because books are heavy and I have to save my luggage weight for dictionaries I need for my translation work and books I find in Portugal that I’d like to translate into English. I used to listen to audiobooks on long drives when I had a car, but now that I live in New York City, I don’t drive anymore and I don’t listen to audiobooks either. 
What did you do to excite your own children about reading?
My husband and I read to our children every night, even when they were in middle school. They went through a rebellious phase when they refused to read, but both of them are now enthusiastic readers.

Hospital Gets 'A' Safety Score By West Kentucky Star Staff MURRAY, KY - New Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grades, which assign A, B, C, D and F letter grades to hospitals nationwide and provide the most complete picture of patient safety in the U.S., were announced Friday by The Leapfrog Group, a national patient safety watchdog. Murray-Calloway County Hospital was one of 823 hospitals to receive an “A”, ranking among the safest hospitals in the United States. “I’m extremely excited to announce to you that our organization earned a fourth straight “A” rating from Leapfrog for our overall safety posture. That is fantastic because only 12 hospitals in Kentucky got “A” ratings! We collectively do a fantastic job and I am so proud of our staff, and greatly appreciate being able to brag on their success when it comes to safety,” said Jerry Penner, CEO at MCCH.“Protecting patients from harm is the most important charge for any hospital,” said Leah Binder, president and CEO of The Leapfrog Group. “We recognize and appreciate ‘A’ hospitals’ vigilance and continued dedication to keeping their patients safe.” Developed under the guidance of an Expert Panel, the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade uses 30 measures of publicly available hospital safety data to assign A, B, C, D and F grades to more than 2,600 U.S. hospitals twice per year. It is calculated by top patient safety experts, peer-reviewed, fully transparent and free to the public.

(Photo: Gary A. Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports) 447 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE 
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Ryan Getzlaf scored the tiebreaking power-play goal with 4:46 to play on a bizarre deflection off Lance Bouma’s skate, and the Anaheim Ducks beat the Calgary Flames 3-2 Saturday night to take a 2-0 lead in their first-round playoff series. 
Getzlaf’s attempted pass across the high slot banked off Bouma’s foot and somehow arched through the air and past Calgary’s Brian Elliott for the Anaheim captain’s second goal of the series. 
Jakob Silfverberg and Rickard Rakell scored first-period goals and John Gibson made 35 saves in the Ducks’ 29th consecutive victory over the Flames at Honda Center since April 25, 2006, extending the longest such streak in NHL history. 
Mikael Backlund scored a short-handed goal and Sean Monahan had a power-play goal for the Flames. 
Game 3 is Monday in Calgary. 
Elliott stopped 26 shots for Calgary, which rallied from an early two-goal deficit and repeatedly threatened to take the lead before that heartbreaking bounce on Getzlaf’s winner. 
They still haven’t won a regular-season game in Orange County since 2004, but the young Flames are headed back to Alberta with concrete knowledge they can play anywhere with the five-time Pacific Division champion Ducks. 
Still, the Anaheim crowd serenaded the Flames with its now-familiar chant: “You can’t win here!” 
Playing without injured top defensemen Cam Fowler and Sami Vatanen, the Ducks survived a shaky second period with a strong third and more of their usual veteran poise. Anaheim hasn’t lost in regulation in 16 consecutive games since March 10. 
Silfverberg and Rakell scored for the second straight game, following up their goals in Anaheim’s 3-2 win in Game 1 with goals in the opening seven minutes of the rematch. 
The Ducks started quickly again, with Silfverberg beating Elliott just 3:21 into Game 2 with his silky wrist shot. Silfverberg went goalless in Anaheim’s seven-game loss to Nashville in the first round last season. 
Rakell then doubled the lead when Getzlaf’s pass took a funny bounce and allowed Rakell to wrap a shot underneath Elliott. 
Anaheim had a chance to seize control late in the first when Flames rookie Matthew Tkachuk took a double minor for high-sticking, but Backlund capitalized on a turnover and scored on a short-handed breakaway. 
The Flames evened it in the second when Monahan cashed in a pass from Johnny Gaudreau for his second goal of the series. 
Calgary nearly went ahead moments later when the puck slipped underneath Gibson during a physical scrum in the crease, but video review confirmed the on-ice call of no goal, infuriating Flames coach Glen Gulutzan. 
NOTES: Vatanen was a late scratch with an upper-body injury after participating in the pregame skate. Korbinian Holzer made his NHL playoff debut at late notice. The German veteran hadn’t played a postseason game since 2014 with the AHL’s Toronto Marlies, and he hadn’t played for Anaheim since April 4 after flying home late in the regular season for a personal matter. … Chad Johnson was Elliott’s backup. He hadn’t suited up since leaving the Flames’ game at Anaheim on April 4 after just a few minutes with a lower-body injury. … Ducks F Nick Ritchie made his Stanley Cup playoff debut. The bruising power forward was suspended for the opener after punching Chicago’s Michal Rozsival in Anaheim’s penultimate regular-season game. Facebook Posted!

Data Sources: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from their inception up to August 15, 2016 for SSD, BCD, and their synonyms. Study Selection: In total, 523 articles were retrieved, of which 12 satisfied the eligibility quality criteria. Our outcomes of interest were: 1) the BCD implantation rejection percentage, 2) reasons to reject BCD implantation, and 3) possible prognostic factors predicting the trial outcome. Data Extraction and Synthesis: At critical appraisal, six studies (n = 471 patients) scored a moderate to high directness of evidence and a medium or low risk of bias and were selected for data extraction. Due to heterogeneity between studies, pooling of data for meta-analysis was not feasible. Therefore, results of studies were summarized per outcome: 1) after the BCD trial, 32.0 to 69.6% of SSD patients rejected BCD implantation, 2) the three main reasons for rejection were experiencing limited benefit from the device, patients fearing or being unfit for surgery and cosmetic aspects, 3) no clear prognostic factors predicting the trial outcome could be identified. Conclusion: Roughly half of patients rejected BCD implantation after a trial period. From the current literature it is unclear which patients could benefit most from BCD implantation. High level of evidence studies should be conducted to investigate possible prognostic factors that predict the BCD trial outcome. Copyright (C) 2017 by Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

What niche should you choose and how to find whether it’s profitable or not? 
Choosing a profitable, low competition niche is quite difficult even for many established bloggers . And for newbies, they may have virtually no idea how to find one. 
But as Amazon has a vast variety of products, it’s actually pretty simple. 
Here are a few points you should consider before choosing a niche: 
First- Make sure you have an interest in the niche you want to promote on your blog. 
When I started my first blog in Feb. 2015, I didn’t do any research, but I was fond of gaming and computer parts. So, I just started my website on that. I had no idea about writing good articles and doing keyword research , and I made a lot of deadly mistakes that caused me to delete my whole blog multiple times. 
But as my interest kept me writing articles on the niche, I stayed positive. If I had started writing on fashion design, simply because it’s a profitable niche, surely I would have failed miserably because of my lack of knowledge and interest. 
But what if you have knowledge in a field that doesn’t have a product sold on Amazon? 
Well, that’s a problem. 
When I made my first blog successful , I started another Amazon-based website that was related to furniture. I don’t know anything about this niche, but money is my motivation here. 
When you find a profitable niche, then you will automatically start writing on products you don’t even like. But because you’ve learned that you like blogging, you can learn how to overlook the lack of interest in the niche. 
This will make you more knowledgeable in that field as well as help you earn more money. 
But this is not recommended for newbies. The trick here is discipline. It’s better to give this one a shot after you’ve already built up a successful blog around a niche you like, otherwise, as pointed out above, you will fail miserably. 
Some good niches you can try right now are: Automotive parts Home decoration Any sports niche like water sports, skating, or winter sports 
Note that every niche will have some competition, but these niches are not so saturated at the moment. 
Pro tip: Always make notes of a niche you are going to start before posting your first article. How To Rank Faster In These Niches 
Ranking is getting tougher as bloggers are emerging in every field every day. Know that it can take several months when you do SEO with white hat techniques (i.e. “legal” SEO practices), but Google will eventually trust your site more than other sites . So keep your site clean and make great content. 
1. Produce content from reviews, not from product descriptions . 
To rank faster, you need to produce quality content. 
To do that, you can’t just re-write the description from Amazon’s product page. 
Instead, you should read the customer reviews and use them to elaborate on your points. 
If you do this, people will trust you more as you are listing the pros as well as the cons. But be sure you always choose products with many reviews (especially those with 4-star ratings and above). 
2. Update Regularly . 
The second step to ranking faster is to continuously update. 
You need to update every article at least once a month. Read: Why you must edit old posts . 
And yes, it’s a headache, but it really works. 
A lot of my competitors are confused why I am ranking above them, even though I don’t have too many dofollow links and I have a much lower PA and DA . 
They don’t realize that there are several other factors that increase Google ranking. 
For instance, if you get backlinks from relevant niche sites, then that counts as a ranking factor in the eyes of Google much better than getting backlinks from sites in a completely different niche. Even if your link is nofollow , it will still help you in ranking faster because Google doesn’t ignore it completely. 
Updating your content regularly and fetching it with Google search console will make the Google bots crawl your post again and again. When you change or add some content, Google gives it priority over those that aren’t updated regularly. 
Note: When you update your content, also make sure that you change the date/time of update. 
3. Use links with the keyword . 
The third tip is to use the exact keyword in your URL which you are going to target. 
I have seen that the URLs which have the exact keyword without alteration tend to rank higher than the others. And this is one of the strategies I use to rank my sites above my competitors. 
Yes, some of my links may be long, but they contain the exact keyword, and this method helps me consistently rank higher. But at the same time, make sure that if you are going to update the article with some new products, you should not include the specific name of any product in your URL. 
Must read: How to edit permalink of already published blog post How To Increase The Conversion Rate 
If you think that changing colors of ‘Buy’ links or optimizing images doesn’t affect the conversion rate, then think about every successful online business out there. 
Why are colors like red and blue the most widely used colors in ‘Buy’ buttons? 
Why don’t people use pink or gray? 
When I first used black for my buttons, I got half the amount of clicks as I did with blue and red. 
Not only that, even the size of these buttons matter. The button size should not be too small so that a reader can’t see and not too large to fill up the whole width of your page. Instead, use a size somewhere between 200-400 pixels. 
Now, experiment by changing the colors around. Blue and red tend to have the most dramatic effects on CTR. 
-Include More Links- 
‘Buy’ buttons should not be the only place with links. 
You must use the affiliate links in images and text as well. 
Remember that when you use a product name in a paragraph, put a link in that particular product name which should redirect them through your Amazon affiliate link. 
Be sure you are using a catchy color for that text so that it attracts the visitor. 
You just need to get a click because that’s how you get the user to drop a cookie on Amazon. 
Amazon uses a 24-hour cookie to track your ID and gives you commission even if it’s not the same product as you promoted. 20% of the products I get a commission from are different than the products I promote. 
-Use A Link Localizer- 
80% of affiliates don’t use a link localizer, which is stunning, because you are losing a lot of money if you are not using one. 
Here’s how this works… 
I am Indian, and I target four countries: USA UK India 
80% of my affiliate income is from the USA, which is pretty common for many affiliate marketers. But countries like the UK and Canada give good conversions as well. 
The point is that when a user from the US clicks on my link, it takes them to the US Amazon store. When a user from Canada clicks on a link, it takes them to the Canada Amazon store. 
Note: I use Payoneer for getting payments from the UK and Canada, and I am still figuring out whether I should get a check or direct transfer! LOL! But I can use that money for hiring a native English writer or do a gift card giveaway for Canadian people. 
You’re probably thinking that I’m using the EasyAzon plugin or something like that for link localizing. But no, I use a website called Affiliate Geo Target . You can also use popular tool call Geni.us that is used by ShoutMeLoud & other blogs. 
For using Affiliate Geo target, you have to fill in the product ASIN’s from the product page and the tracking IDs from each of the country’s Amazon affiliate dashboards. Doing that, whenever a visitor clicks the link, they will be redirected to their country’s Amazon store. 
This site will replace every 100 th affiliate ID with their own ID, but it’s still a good deal because you were already losing a lot of money by not using it. 
But be sure the product you are promoting is also available on every Amazon store. If not, you should only fill in the Amazon.com’s product ASIN and use the Fallback Search Terms. Promotion Is Important 
Posting and praying that traffic will come doesn’t work anymore. It’s like throwing a party at the middle of jungle where no one known how to reach. You have to quality time promoting the content. 
From the very first time you post your first article, you should create a separate profile for your brand or niche blog on each social media platform like Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Reddit, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and others. These are mega authority websites, and getting a nofollow link from them will surely help. Whenever you add a new content, you should post them on your social media.

This is what I learned I have written about how I became a multi-millionaire at 27 , and what that taught me. I was at a meditation retreat recently, when it became clear to me that I had to write this story: how I spent nearly all of that money, and what I learned in the process. At age 33, I was working from home in the U.K. I lived in Brighton, a beautiful town on the South Coast, by the English Channel. I had never visited the U.K. office of my employer. I could have travelled and worked anywhere in the world. I was being paid around $200,000 per year ($220,000 to $240,000 in today’s money). I owned a five bedroom house outright, a house in a sought-after area. I was continually getting lucrative stock-option grants that supplemented my annual income by tens or hundreds of thousands per year. I tracked my work hours carefully, and I found that I was working around twenty hours per week. In spite of this, my performance continually and consistently led to me being ranked and rated by management in the top five percent of the employees at the company. However, I still felt guilty, and thought that I was not working enough. I was highly regarded by my peers; I was told that my engineering prowess was legendary at the company HQ in California. Earlier in my career there, I had been walking along a corridor when I heard one of the co-founders of the company say to someone from HR, “Duncan is a god!” I stopped in my tracks and quickly turned to walk away, hoping that I could avoid him the presumed embarrassment of knowing that I had heard what he said. I also had additional cash and investments that amounted to somewhere between 1.5 and 2 million dollars. I’m telling you all this not to brag, but to let you know how blessed my life appeared to be from an outside perspective. By this point, I had just finalized a painful divorce, a divorce that was not by my choosing. I had settled my alimony and other obligations with my ex-wife by leaving her with over one million dollars in cash and other assets. I felt at the time that this was unfair, because I had generated most of our wealth single-handedly before our son had been conceived, our son who was four at the time. I had become disheartened with my work. After having spent years becoming a world-class computer architect, I wasn’t finding my work challenging enough. I wasn’t learning enough new things. For years, I had supplemented my learning at work by getting a master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in my spare time. That was now completed. I also wanted to have a greater influence in the world. As a manager, I had already realized that the hardest problems at work were not technical, but emotional and relational. People struggled with their personal lives, with motivation, and with finding meaning. I wanted to motivate people. I felt that my life course needed to change, but I didn’t know how. I wrote an email to the CEO of the S&P500 company that I worked for, the same company that I had worked for since it was as struggling start-up, “You seem to know what you’re doing, and I’m wondering if you can help me to get clarity.” His assistant scheduled a meeting with me. I knew that it was a privilege to get a meeting with this man, who I consider a friend, so I started preparing. I created lots of lists with titles like, “what I’m good at,” “what I’m interested in,” “what I definitely don’t want to spend my time doing,” and “what is meaningful to me.” A day or so before meeting with the CEO, I was taking a shower when I realized that I wanted to be a motivational speaker, lead workshops, and write books. I thought that I needed to get a PhD in psychology to do this. When I met with the CEO, I told him that I had already figured out what I wanted to do. I wanted to quit my job and get a PhD in Clinical Psychology. He told me that I should follow my heart, and that the money would take care of itself. He said that I would never have a problem getting a job in Silicon Valley, and he said that I could come back and work there full time or part time anytime I wanted. I really appreciated him saying that, and I have carried those words with me over the past decade. I enrolled in a PhD program at a small professional psychology school in Palo Alto, California, and I started my journey of getting a PhD. At the time the school was called The Institute of Transpersonal Psychology. That was in the fall of 2007, almost ten years ago. In those ten years, I have also spent or lost most of the financial wealth I had. I lost a large chunk in the 2008 market crash, and the rest was spent in living for ten years without any income. It’s been a long decade, and I have learned a lot. I have learned a lot partly because of the mistakes I have made since I quit my job, and I have also learned a lot by reflecting on my life before I quit my job. Before I really get started, part of me wants you to know how busy I’ve been in those ten years. I want you to know that I haven’t been lazing around. Here are some of the things I’ve been up to: Three years of full time psychology classes Two years of clinical practicum (giving people therapy for free) Two years of pre-doctoral internship (giving more people therapy for free) Preparing and filing a US patent application Self-representing in a UK patent dispute Several legal battles related to maintaining and increasing contact with my son Building a mobile app business (2.5 years) Traveling and living around the world Executing a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled research study for my PhD Getting lots of therapy and coaching, and attending many self-development workshops and retreats. I remember saying to my mother on the phone, “I’m going to finish this PhD, and I’ll do it even if I have to use up all the equity in my house.” Well, here I am. I built the research devices and the web app to collect data. I have done the statistical analysis and the thematic analysis. I have a dissertation ready to be reviewed by my committee. As I am writing this my money is running out, and here are some of the things I have learned. We’re always taking the best choices on our menus I have found myself looking back at choices I made that I now see as being non-optimal. I have a tendency to beat myself up for making what seemed like a bad decision. It is very hard to put ourselves into the shoes of another?—?or even into the shoes of our past self?—?and understand why we made the choices we did. What we can know is that everyone is continually making the best choices they have on their inner menus. As you read the following, it’s sometimes going to look like I’m beating myself up. I’m mostly trying to be aware of what could have been, and attempting to learn from it. I hope that I can learn, and I hope you can learn as well. Put yourself in the path of money The amount of money you make is not related to how hard you work, or even how much value you add. Money is flowing all around us. You make money in proportion to how much you place yourself in the flow of value transfer. Position yourself where there is a flow of money, and facilitate it. You might also find a place where there is a potential flow of money, and create or increase the flow. Surf big waves Making a lot of money is like surfing. You sit in the ocean and look out to sea, looking for waves to form. You watch as waves rise up and then break. You start to anticipate how and where waves will form, and you start to paddle in that direction. As a wave approaches, you align yourself with the direction that the wave is moving, and then you begin paddling really intensely. As you feel the mighty push from behind, you jump up onto the board, and ride it for as long as possible. You’re going to wipe-out, fall off, and face plant. This is part of the process of surfing, and particularly learning to surf. When you come off, you paddle back out to catch another wave. You don’t try to catch the wave you just fell from; that one’s done. You are learning the skill of surfing. The swell continues to come in, and the contours of sand on the bottom of the ocean will continue to throw up big waves. “Wiping out is an underappreciated skill.”?—?Laird Hamilton I made a lot of money riding on the PC wave, even while my friends were making much more on the Internet wave. Which wave I rode was an arbitrary and unconscious choice. I could just as easily have been on the Internet wave. A while back, I read a book called Bold by Peter Diamandis, which lists the current exponential technologies. These are technologies that are growing exponentially. Their growth may be almost invisible now, but they will suddenly explode, as did the PC, the Internet, and social media. I decided that I would consciously get on one of the waves he listed. As a problem solver, I chose artificial intelligence because when we solve the problem of super-intelligence—intelligence that is far greater than that of humans—all the other problems will be solved by it. It’s never too late to learn to surf. It’s never too late to get better at surfing. It’s never too late to catch a big wave. Biarritz, France Consider all your options I quit my job to get a PhD in psychology because I thought that this would enable me to lead workshops, do talks, and write books. I now understand that I could have done all of those things without a PhD. In any case, I didn’t need to quit my job to get a PhD. I had enough spare time, and freedom, to have studied and continued to work. I also could have taken a more gentle transition. Instead of making a 100% switch from engineering to psychology, I could have got a master’s degree in counseling psychology in the evenings. Then I could have learned more about the field, and about how I fitted into it. I could have taken small, experimental steps. I also now see how much freedom I had. I could have travelled around the world and worked remotely from exotic locations. Ask yourself what you would like Often the thing that you need in each moment is very simple. Perhaps you need to hear that your partner loves you. Perhaps you need to spend an hour with an old friend. Perhaps you need a walk around the block. I have had a tendency to think that when something was wrong, something really massive was wrong. I have a tendency to catastrophize. Perhaps you don’t really need to quit your job and head for a totally new career. I have many more resources than I did ten years ago, including a much greater capacity for discomfort and uncertainty. I recommend developing equanimity through daily vipassana meditation, and getting the facilitation of a skilled coach to get clarity about what you actually need right now. Obtain and preserve assets People from old money learn to “never spend the principal.” This is an approach to retaining wealth, even if it means living with temporary lack. I spent ten years without any real income, and I spent the principal. Some people spend their entire lives paying off mortgages in order to own just one home. There was a time when I owned three houses on two different continents, at least two of them mortgage-free. Now I don’t own any real estate. I look back and realize that if I had kept my capital and invested it in index funds, and continued to work, I would now have so much wealth that I would never have to work again. I could live by taking such a small piece of the gains in the assets that the principal would continue to grow at a faster pace than inflation. I also recently realized that if I had left all of my wealth in the original company that it came from, I would now have around $35 million. Instead, I have to work again. I have to generate income using my time and energy. It has been hard for me to accept this, but I have to remember that I made the best choices I could at the time. Buy things you love and will use For most of my adult life, I have been able to buy whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I have bought a lot of stuff. I have tended to buy many things that I never use. Recently, we have been purging our things by following the Konmari method, as described in the book called The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up. I enjoy selling things on eBay, or via Craigslist. I enjoy providing really high quality customer service with fast shipping. We have converted much of our stored junk into thousands of dollars in cash. I also love to see things going to people who will use them, rather than putting more stuff into the landfill. This process has made me much more aware of my purchasing habits, and much less likely to make impulse purchases. Over the past few years, because of a general sense of not wanting to waste resources, I have become much more discerning about buying things. When I think I need something, I spend a lot of time reading reviews on Amazon, and looking for the best quality item. I also see if I can get by without it. I have various wish-lists where I record things. Those items rarely turn into purchases. The things I do buy now tend to get well used, and treasured. As I write this, I’m wearing a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones, which I have used the crap out of. At home, I have a sit/stand desk with an oak top that I took from a dining table. I made that desk, and I’ve used it most days for the past 13 years. Objects that we buy are tools that we use to live our lives. Buy things you can trash If you cannot trash it, then you shouldn’t have it. Things you buy are just tools. I once bought a car that cost me $80,000. The base price was $40,000, and I added $40,000 of options. I ended up selling it two years later for $40,000. During those two years, I worried all the time about it getting dented or scratched. One day, I might have a car that costs me over $100,000, but I won’t do that until my net worth is at least 1,000 times that: $100 million. A car is a tool Cars depreciate. They are not investments. It doesn’t matter if you finance or lease. It’s going to work out roughly the same either way. A reasonably functional car costs about the same every year, when averaged out over a few years. Some people regularly buy new cars because then they don’t have to pay for expensive repairs, but a new car depreciates rapidly. Sometimes when I take my old car in for a service, it needs some expensive work. I remember that the cost of those repairs and services over the year average out to the cost of owning a car. Get unstuck I used to get stuck and not know what to do. I didn’t even realize that I was stuck. I’ve now had enough therapy and coaching, and breakthroughs from meditation, that I know that being stuck is good. Embrace being stuck. Enjoy being confused. Find a really good coach and let them support you in getting clarity. All the time you resist being stuck, or pretend to yourself that you’re not stuck, or think that you can “do it myself,” you will stay stuck. Be okay with not knowing There’s a lot of value in being confused and in not knowing the answers. When I went to meet with the CEO of my company, I automatically tried to figure out the answers in advance. I now realize that I missed a massive opportunity. I could have gone into that meeting and told him, “I’m really confused. I’ve just been through a massively painful divorce, and I feel like my life has lost its meaning. All I know is that I want to do something with my life that’s more meaningful, and I want to influence more people.” That conversation could have led anywhere, and I could have got the real benefit of working with my friend, and letting him help me. That conversation could have blossomed into a powerful collaboration. Instead, I made sure I had all the answers before I spoke with him. You don’t need qualifications I now have two master’s degrees, and I’m about to get a PhD. Many times during my PhD process, I wanted to start a business, and I held myself back until I finished my PhD. At one point, I wanted to get an MBA, and I talked with a friend about it. The answer I got was that I didn’t need an MBA to start a business. I still proceeded with my PhD. I did take a break from my PhD, while still paying tuition, to work on an app business, but that didn’t work out. Very early on in my PhD process, I was tired of researching and writing long and complex papers that I would not be paid for, and which often would barely be read. Yet I persisted with my PhD. This was partly because I tend to persist with things I start. Once I commit to something, I tend to find it very hard to change direction. I suspect that part of me places formal qualifications in the way of my success. I feel that I have to get some external validation that I am qualified or capable to do something. In fact, I can coach people effectively without a PhD in psychology. I can do all the things I originally set out to do without qualifications. I can deliver talks, write books, and lead workshops right now, and I could before I even started on my PhD program. Lifelong learning is now free Maybe I had to get three graduate degrees to realize this. Most days I study now, and I do it outside of the framework of any externally-defined study plan. I’m getting (another) world-class education, on my terms, for free. One example is my process of becoming a world-class expert in AI. This is one of my goals, and the way I’m currently approaching it is to take all the Stanford graduate-level classes in AI. Having gotten a master’s degree in Electrical Engineering (and CS) from Stanford, I know exactly what it’s like to go through those classes, when enrolled. Even now I’m not enrolled at Stanford, I can watch the videos of the class I’m taking right now on YouTube. I can read the syllabus and download the slides to follow along. I can read all the documents, including the assignments. One of the most effective ways that I learn is by doing. Working through these assignments on my own is just as effective as doing them while enrolled in a degree program. Beyond the massive amounts of free classes from top universities, many sites like Udemy and Coursera offer free and almost free classes in every subject. With an investment of only your time, attention, and curiosity, you can become an expert in anything you choose. Get good at pivoting Within a year or two of starting my PhD in Clinical Psychology I knew that I didn’t want to become a licensed Clinical Psychologist. I had many business ideas, and I also found myself becoming interested in organizational psychology, law, and business. I thought about getting a JD or an MBA, or starting a business, but I kept persisting with my PhD. One of my weaknesses is sticking with things that aren’t right for me. Being aware of this tendency enables me to watch out for it, and to consciously and bravely pivot when necessary. Bite off small projects My PhD was a massive project that took ten years. I made it way more complex and challenging than it needed to be. Instead of doing the bare minimum to get a PhD, I create a gold-standard clinical trial, along with two adjunct engineering projects. My PhD project was at a scale that would cost hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars when properly funded. I am now determined to commit to much smaller projects, and to break larger projects down into easily completable pieces. It feels great to complete something. Once a piece is complete, and I have run the experiment associated with it, I can re-evaluate if I want to proceed with the larger project. This is very much in the vein of the lean startup approach. I believe that it makes sense to run your whole life on the lean startup model. Always be figuring out simple experiments that you can run and get data from. Always be ready to pivot. Avoid litigation Even if you win a lawsuit, the cost in time and stress is usually not worth it. I have spent years going through court to try to get “justice,” or trying to get what’s best for everyone. Now that I’ve done this a few times, I understand the true cost of it. I understand that winning often looks like walking away. When you’re in a lawsuit, it’s with you all day, every day. It wears you down. It takes a lot more to get me involved in a lawsuit than it used to. Even then when technically and legally you should win, there can be forces acting behind the scenes that lead to you losing. In my patent litigation, since the judge’s decision did not match the evidence or arguments, I suspect that some lord at the head of the patent office spoke with some lord at the head of my undergraduate university, and strings were pulled to protect the university. Also, a court of law is not a place to resolve family issues. In law, there is a winner and a loser. In a family, that paradigm does not apply. What most people want for their family is health, wealth, harmony, and happiness. If you can’t get this outside of a court, you will certainly not get it inside a court. Mindfulness is primary A couple of summers back, my wife and I were staying in Biarritz in the South of France. While there, I was working on my app business. I had estimated that the business would produce around $1.4 million per year for me, once we got our subscription model working. Having burned through a lot of my wealth, and having worked for free for around 2.5 years, I was looking forward to turning my cashflow around. During this time, I realized that we were never going to make it, and that I needed to focus my energy on getting my PhD complete. I needed to stop investing in this business that was not going anywhere. I quit the business. Even though I was in a beautiful place, with great weather, and I had a surfboard, I went into a deep depression. My wife, Cindy, signed me up for a 10-day Vipassana retreat for when we got back to the U.S. This was to be my second 10-day retreat. During that retreat, I came out of my depression, and I realized that I needed to keep practicing every day. I became free of depression and anxiety, and I have meditated between 30 and 120 minutes per day for years now. I have been on a third 10-day retreat since then, and will go on a fourth later this year. Vipassana meditation, which is an industrial-strength form of mindfulness meditation, is foundational for me. It’s one of the most important things I do every day. It changes my relationship with reality. It enables me to see the world, and my place in it, clearly. I recommend signing up for a free 10-day retreat near you. Yosemite National Park Money isn’t everything Sometimes I look at my contemporaries who stayed on the same path, and I feel envy. Some are CEOs, venture capital partners, and distinguished engineers. Most of them are wealthy, with multiple homes. If I had stayed working, I would be wealthy and distinguished. Instead, financially, I am almost back at square-one. Then I remember how I felt when I quit my job, and I realize that it would not have been a happy path. I can’t know for certain how my contemporaries feel, but I understand how warped I would have grown. Instead, I spent these ten years investing in myself, deepening my relationship with myself, and learning to live a balanced life. My wife believes that I have intentionally used up the money from the first phase of my life, and flushed out that energy, in order to make space for a fresh start. This resonates with me. I have immense goals for my life, and I feel that I have created a solid foundation for them inside myself, in my intimate relationship with my wife, and with my solid tribe. Going forward, I will thrive in life at a level that would not have been possible if I had not gone through this process of purging and recalibration. Summary I hope that all of this experience will fuel and support the next phase of my life. I believe that my experience with this relatively small amount of money has positioned me to handle the much larger amounts of money coming my way. I hope that you too have been able to learn something from, and benefit from, my experience. Call to action Click on the heart ? so that this article will be seen by more people on Medium. Thank you.

Quests 
In Etheria, as Ybrahim taunts Asval being  a coward, Danaya wanted peace. Avria said that it wouldn't happen because of  the lack of trust from both sides. In Lireo, Paopao told the others that Cassiopeia is with Emre helping him with his quest and the leaders except Pirena are now in Etheria, Muyak said that the gems will be demanded as a part of it. Aquil said that maybe they are already know what they are doing. Back in Etheria, Danaya told Avria that the gems are not going to be used against each other and Avria told her that if they have give it to her. Danaya presents her the earth gem as a sign of peace. In the gates of Hathoria, Amarro told Pirena the abilities of Avria that he knew, but Pirena said that she knew those as well. Then, Amarro told Pirena about the Golden Hourglass which can made a person holding it travels back, as Avria used it to gather all of her soldiers. Pirena asked where it is as it is revealed that she was going to use it to get back in time, in Capade. Back in Etheria, Ybrahim questioned the move of Danaya but she told him to let her give it. Then, Avria takes the earth gem. After that, she also asked for the other gems, a hesitant Alena offered hers, if they promised that she will gave them peace. Avria said that she think of it and all the battles are stopped. Back in the gates of Etheria, Amarro told Pirena that Avria had the golden hourglass and they don't know where it is. Then, LilaSari asked Pirena where her daughter is, and she told that she is in Adjantao where Hagorn keeps her there. LilaSari thanked her and they went on to Adjantao. Pirena muttered an apology for not telling LilaSari the truth after they left. Back in Etheria, Hagorn told Asval that the Diwatas are planning something, as they are not giving up a gem easily and they are not fools. Back in Lireo, as the others are now in the council room, Danaya told them that there will be peace in Encantadia as she gives up the earth gem. Ybrahim questioned this and the others are upset. Then, she asked everyone to leave, where leaders remain. Danaya told Alena to use the power of the water gem so no one can hear what they are about to discuss. Then, it is revealed that Danaya gave Avria a fake earth gem, as Danaya ordered the gem to generate a fake copy of it. Ybrahim apologized and Imaw said that Avria may learn of this sooner. Danaya told them that by the time that she realized it, Devas are now reconquered by Emre and Cassiopeia. Back in Etheria, Pirena appeared and asked the Hathor soldiers to tell Hagorn that she was there. Then, the Hathor soldiers took her to a place where she is safe. Then, as Asval agreed what Hagorn said, the Hathor soldier went to whisper Hagorn something, Hagorn said that he will be going somewhere and Asval asked him where, Hagorn said to him that he is in no position to know all his whereabouts. Back in Lireo, Ybrahim crumpled the Etherian symbol in his hands. Ariana arrives and engaged in a conversation. Then, Alena heard it and after Ybrahim leave, Alena asked Ariana if she has feelings for Ybrahim. Then, as Ariana seemed to worry, Alena said not to, but she encourage her to make Ybrahim fell in love with her. In the outskirts of Etheria, Hagorn arrive and met Pirena. She asked told him that she mislead Amarro and LilaSari in finding Deshna. Then, she asked him to for help to enter Etheria. Hagorn doesn't want to help her, but Pirena said that she will help LilaSari to get Deshna from him. Back in Etheria, Asval told Avria about his doubts on the earth gem. Avria asked an Etherian soldier to approach her and used the earth gem against him to proved that it was real. Back in Lireo, Danaya thanked the real earth gem to bestow a little power on the fake one. Danaya wished and prayed that Cassiopeia and Emre may finish their quest quickly so that they can go on to the next step against Etherians. Back in Etheria, Hagorn leads a Hathor soldier that turns out to be Pirena. She thanked him and Hagorn leaves, then Pirena transformed in to an Etherian soldier.  
In the outskirts, Emre told Cassiopeia about Haliya, the goddess of the moon. Emre also said that Haliya tends to bathe on the Spring of Truth. In Lireo, as Aquil approached Danaya, she remind him not to approach her. Then, Alena saw it and then asked Danaya to give the throne to her. Danaya thanked her for that and said that she wanted to defeat Etheria under her rule first. In Etheria, the soldiers bowed to Avria, on of that is Pirena, as an Etherian soldier. Then, Avria is watching the gems in her hand and told herself that there is two left. She also said that she will go back in time to change the past, where Etheria has been defeated by the three kingdoms, as she was planning to reverse it. Back in the outskirts, Emre and Cassiopeia kept appearing in the same place. Then, Ether appears together with Etherian soldiers. They engaged in a fight and they defeated the soldiers. Then, Emre was angry at Ether where the bathaluman said that he will not reconquer Devas and Ether attacked them. Back in Etheria, Pirena saw Avria passing by and then found the location of the golden hourglass, which is in her room. She attempt to take it but a powerful enchantment had been placed in it in which she easily removed and it alerts Avria. Then, the enchantment activated again, and Pirena was unable to touch the golden hourglass again. Avria rushed and ordered to capture the person who attempt to get the golden hourglass and Avria leaves. In the outskirts of Etheria, Pirena escaped and tells herself that she will try to get the golden hourglass again. Back in Etheria, Asval and Andora is still searching for the person who attempt to get the golden hourglass. Hagorn on the other hand, examines where the golden hourglass was placed. Back in the outskirts, in order to prevent Ether to know their actions, Emre and Cassiopeia speaked to each other using their minds. Meanwhile, Ether is observing them not too far away and tells that the two are staring and thought that they are falling for each other. Then she realized that they are speaking with each other using their minds, much to her dismay. Back in Lireo, as Alena waits for Pirena, Muros said that she will not be coming back at the moment as she is in rift with Danaya. Alena was sad about the misunderstanding and told them to rest. Then, the Gunikars arrived and Memfes said that she must return to Adamya and Memfes leaves after kissing her hand. Back in the outskirts, Ether faced Emre and bounds him into the tree. In the Spring of Truth, Cassiopeia arrives and waits for Haliya. In Adamya, Alena arrived and Banak and Nakba told her that Memfes captured some of the Adamyans. In the gates of Hathoria, Luna told Hagorn that Pirena was there. Hagorn slaps her and told her that Avria knows that it is her who tried to get the golden hourglass. Pirena apologized telling him that it had an alarm. Luna asked him what is it and Hagorn told her that it is used to time travel. Pirena also said that she will intend to use it in order to go back to time that the new gem keepers are in Capade. As Hagorn told her not to enter Etheria for the time being, Pirena said that she will try and try to get the golden hourglass. Luna told Pirena that she will help, which made Hagorn angry. And Pirena asked her younger sister if she was ready. 

In Adamya, Alena called Memfes to show. Memfes appears and Alena asked him why he hold the Adamyans. Memfes said that he will let go of the Adamyans he captured until she agreed to marry him. Then, Alena refused. Memfes said that she will learn how to love him and Alena used her powers and hit Memfes. When she realized it, she apologized to him and Memfes said that she will love him soon. Alena used again her powers and Memfes leaves. In Etheria, Avria carried the golden hourglass and Asval asked her where she had been. Avria replied that she went done something and they will learn it when they are ready to introduced themselves to them. On the other hand, Hagorn is nearby and saw what happened. In the outskirts of Etheria, Pirena and Luna arrived. Luna asked her why they didn't enter the palace already. Pirena said that Avria will know. Luna warned her to about using her again as a bait. Then, Hitano arrived and offered help. Pirena and Luna instructed him to mislead the soldiers by running. Hitano agrees, and then Etherian soldiers followed him. In the Spring of Truth, a woman sings, and it is revealed that the said woman is Bathalumang Haliya. Cassiopeia said that she is probably the bathaluman because she sensed different in her. When Cassiopeia was about to approached her, the bathaluman stops her and leaves. Cassiopeia asked her to remain as they needed her help to regain Devas. Then, a voice told Cassiopeia that Haliya is shy and thats why she resides in the moon. Cassiopeia ordered him to show. Back in Etheria, Pirena and Luna entered the palace, but hides when Asval and Andora arrives. Then, Asval and Andora tell Avria that they captured an intruder, which is Hitano. Then, they interrogate him. Hitano said that he was lurking nearby, but Asval accused him. Andora asked Avria if she wants Hitano to be punished, but Hitano reminded her of his status as an Ivtre. Then, Avria doesn't want to have the Diwatas a reason not to give the water gem to her. So she ordered to release Hitano and then, Hitano leaves. Back in the Spring of Truth, Cassiopeia ordered him to show up and told him that she needed to know everything about Haliya. Then he showed up and it is revealed that he's a creature from the said spring. Back in Etheria, the alarm activates again which cause dismay to Avria. Pirena and Luna appeared at Avria's room, only to find out that the golden hourglass was not there then Avria summoned his soldiers to go to her room to find out who again tried to steal the golden hourglass and then she leaves. In Lireo, Hitano told Danaya about the doings of Pirena and Luna. Then, Danaya told Muros to call Imaw. Back in Etheria, Avria as well as Asval and Andora found out that the golden hourglass was stolen from them and they believe that the Diwatas are behind this. In the gates of Hathoria, Pirena and Luna arrives. Pirena was angry that the golden hourglass was not in its place and Luna told her that it may be hidden somewhere because she tried to get it before. Pirena intends to get the golden hourglass in any way possible and then leaves. Back in Lireo, as Ariana was doing her training, Ybrahim thinks of Amihan. Then, Manik arrives telling him that his she is beautiful and when he asked him, Manik said that he and Ariana are bethrothed on their custom and then Ybrahim leaves. On the other hand, Imaw shows using his balintataw that Pirena tried to get the golden hourglass and she knows the reason behind this and she also said that it would disturbed the temporary peace between Etheria and the kingdoms. Back in Etheria, Avria ordered a soldier to send a letter to Lireo, then Pirena appeared and frankly said that she wants the golden hourglass. Avria said that it was being stolen from her and Pirena didn't believe it. Then, Danaya arrives and apologized to Avria what Pirena did. Avria said that they leave and both Sang'gres leave. Back in Lireo, Alena is still angry with Memfes and she bolted out her powers in the palace. Muros and Hitano rushed thinking that they had enemies and then Hitano told her to follow Danaya because of Pirena. Back in the outskirts of Etheria, Danaya confronted Pirena about the golden hourglass. Back in Etheria, Avria is watching them through her balintataw and realizes that the golden hourglass is not with the diwatas. Back in the gates of Hathoria, Hagorn held the golden hourglass.

REVIEW 

A new character, and a new plot. This made this week's episode exciting. Also, it is revealed that Haliya is the shy one and the golden hourglass, which another thing, aside from the gems that they are going to seek. For now, let's wait for next week's episodes to come.

CINCINNATI -- The Brewers cooled off the Reds' hot start by taking three of four games in their series. Sunday's 4-2 victory over Cincinnati in the finale was powered by three home runs, including another long ball by Eric Thames . 
""I can't remember a time in my career where a guy hit five home runs in a single series,"" Milwaukee outfielder Ryan Braun said. ""We're seeing a really, really impressive hitter starting to emerge."" Thames' solo homer MIL@CIN: Thames mashes a solo home run to right field Eric Thames drives a solo home run to right field for his fifth long ball of the series, extending the Brewers' lead to 4-2 in the 7th Full Game Coverage 
Milwaukee spoiled the big league debut of Reds starter Sal Romano and took a 3-0 lead in the top of the third inning with back-to-back homers with one out. First, Braun hit a two-run shot to right field before Travis Shaw hit a booming shot near the top of the right field sun deck. 
• Braun continues Cincy dominance 
Romano was finished after three innings . He allowed three runs (two earned), three hits, four walks, and had two strikeouts and a hit batter. He threw 82 pitches in that short span, only 39 for strikes. Brewers starter Wily Peralta delivered a quality start with two earned runs and three hits allowed over six innings. Peralta walked three and struck out one. Peralta gets Cozart looking MIL@CIN: Peralta records first strikeout of the day Wily Peralta ends the 2nd inning by setting down Zack Cozart on strikes, picking up his first strikeout of the game 
Cincinnati got back into the game after Adam Duvall 's two-out walk against Peralta in the fourth inning. Eugenio Suarez followed by hitting a first-pitch hanging slider for a two-run homer. Thames provided some space when he led off the seventh with a homer to right field against Tim Adleman . 
The Brewers' bullpen provided three scoreless innings, including a perfect ninth from Neftali Feliz for his fourth save. After a 7-2 start, the Reds head into Monday's off day with an 8-5 record. The Brewers are back over .500 at 7-6. Feliz closes the door with a K MIL@CIN: Feliz gets Cozart looking to earn the save Neftali Feliz strikes out Zack Cozart to close out the Brewers' 4-2 win over the Reds, picking up his fourth save of the year 
""We're 8-5 and we haven't pitched well,"" Reds manager Bryan Price said. ""From the starting perspective, we have guys here that I believe that can pitch well and can do a good job. We're not going to endure six innings a night out of the bullpen."" 
MOMENTS THAT MATTERED Reds won't miss Thames: Thames left town after having slugged five homers in the four-game series against the Reds, something that's been done only one other time at Great American Ball Park. Aaron Boone did it for Cincinnati from May 5-8, 2003, vs. the Cardinals. According to Statcast™ , Thames' latest drive carried 423 feet with an exit velocity of 103 mph and a launch angle of 29 degrees. ""That guy ... I heard he had a cult following in Korea, I'd imagine very shortly he'll have a cult following in Milwaukee as well,"" Price said. ""That was very, very impressive."" 
Hamilton robbed Franklin: With two outs in the top of the sixth and a runner on first base, Nick Franklin hit a long drive to center field. Speedy Reds center fielder Billy Hamilton made a long run and stretched his glove for a great over-the-shoulder catch as he fell to the warning track -- saving extra bases and a run. According to Statcast™, it was a four-star catch as the catch probability on the play was 32 percent. Hamilton extends for great grab MIL@CIN: Hamilton takes away a hit at the track Billy Hamilton gets a great read on Nick Franklin's deep fly ball to center field in the 6th and makes a great catch at the warning track 
""That's one of the ones where you come in you're like, 'I don't know what just happened.' It found a way into my glove,"" Hamilton said. ""You just have to smile about it and keep on going. That was a fun one."" More > 
QUOTABLE ""He's been on fire, man.""-- Peralta on Thames 
REPLAY REVIEW With Tucker Barnhart on first base in the bottom of the fifth inning, Adleman tried to sacrifice bunt. Catcher Manny Pina quickly gathered the ball and fired to Orlando Arcia covering second base. Barnhart came in without sliding and was called out before Adleman beat the throw to first base. The Reds challenged the call at second base, believing Arcia pulled his foot off of the bag. Upon review, the replay official determined that the call stands because it could not be definitively determined that the fielder's foot was off the base when the ball contacted the interior of his glove. 
WHAT'S NEXT Brewers: Milwaukee opens a three-game series against the Cubs on Monday night at 7:10 p.m. CT at Wrigley Field. Chase Anderson (1-0, 0.69) will start for Milwaukee against John Lackey (1-1, 3.00). The teams concluded a three-game series just eight days ago, Chicago winning twice. 
Reds: Play resumes Tuesday at 7:10 p.m. ET against the Orioles with Bronson Arroyo making his third start. Arroyo's comeback campaign is off to a rocky start with a 9.90 ERA and 0-2 record but he threw 80 pitches over six innings in his last start, a 5-1 loss to the Brewers.

I based this view on its oversimplifying and overreaching (all of which are habitual in behavioral psychology) as well as methodological lapses that even I could see, confirmed and elaborated on by the eminent psychologist Jerome Kagan. But what I didn't realize was the immense influence of Kahneman and his analysis on major institutions, especially on the Internet, that ultimately may have decided the 2016 elections. These revelations (to me anyway) came in a penetrating review by Tasmin Shaw of a new highly laudatory and uncritical book on Kahneman and friend, published in the New York Review of Books. It leads quickly into the Orwellian world of yet another ultra conservative billionaire and apparently the only thing that unites Bannon and Kushner, the Cambridge Analytica firm that claims to have essentially elected our Homemade Hitler. Kahneman became famous among economists for his insight that, contrary to classical market economic dogma, people do not rationally choose to spend their money in ways most advantageous to themselves, but let emotional factors override their calculations. Incredible insight! Even though this is the very foundation of advertising, and that the heart or appetites winning out over the head with tragic and comic consequences is the theme of countless novels, plays, folk tales and myths over centuries. Amazing! Give that man a Nobel Prize! (They did.) But his current fame is based on his binary worldview of human decisionmaking, between the fast (irrational, cf. emotion and intuition) and the slow (rational, meaning in his terms, doing the math.) His theory exemplifies its conclusions, in that it is easier to manipulate communication if you know what your audience wants to hear and you present it to them in an appealing way, such as a very simple theory that gratifyingly explains everything with just two cute and easy- to- remember choices. But he did produce some math, and together with massive data collection, it did help create algorithms and some less than savory techniques to manipulate choices by going directly to emotions, used with alacrity by Amazon and Facebook, among others. Though the Obama administration made some use of some offshoots of this behaviorial psychology model, Shaw writes, actual political manipulation is claimed for the far right consulting group Cambridge Analytica that cut its teeth proudly manipulating elections in the third world, then may well have worked for the most reactionary Brexit advocates, then definitely did work for our apprentice dictator, and may still be doing so. Some of the techniques and the Cambridge A. connections to billionaire Robert Mercer and the White House are chillingly described in this Guardian article . Here again there are Russian connections--like the zombie websites waiting for the trigger word--and there may be more, if indeed Russian agents stole voter registration data and passed it on through the R campaign to political micro-message manipulators like Cambridge A. Some dispute its effectiveness, Shaw writes. ""But this doesn’t mean that there is no threat to democracy once we start relying less on information that can be critically scrutinized in favor of unconscious manipulation."" That manipulation may include actually subconscious phenomena, Shaw suggests, through the use of what used to be called subliminal advertising--for example, emojs flashing on web sites too fast to be consciously seen. All this is at least as old as Vance Packard and The Hidden Persuaders in the 1950s, but its now on computational and electronic steroids. There is perhaps an irony in that Kahneman began by advocating for the rational side. But, as Shaw writes: ""The two-systems view has managed to lend the appearance of legitimacy to techniques that might otherwise appear coercive."" Shaw states his own rejection of the Kahneman model: ""Psychologists have not yet uncovered the fundamental mechanisms governing human thought or finally found the secret key to mind control. Since the human mind is not straightforwardly a mechanism (or we are at least far from proving that it is) and its workings are unfathomably complex so far, they may never succeed in that venture. Some of the biases they have identified can easily be redescribed in ways that don’t make them seem like irrational biases at all; some are not transferable across different environments. The fundamental assumption of two discreet systems cannot be sustained."" But--Shaw warns:""this does not mean we can disregard the propaganda initiatives derived from Kahneman and Tversky’s work,"" especially when wedded with the global influence of the Internet and the power of Big Data. Big Data magnifies Big Lies. Shaw's conclusion is glum: ""It is still possible to envisage behavioral science playing a part in the great social experiment of providing the kind of public education that nurtures the critical faculties of everyone in our society. But the pressures to exploit irrationalities rather than eliminate them are great and the chaos caused by competition to exploit them is perhaps already too intractable for us to rein in."" The only hope in that regard lies in Kahneman's basic mistake: his fast and slow division, which distorts the nature of both intuition and intelligence. Actual intuition and intelligence enable us to see patterns (so for example that Homemade Hitler's moronic soundbite speeches finally make sense as crude recitations of the keywords identified in this research as triggers for a selected audience.) And they also enable us to take charge of changing our own minds--a topic I hope to go into here soon.

“Now I know what target practice felt like before 9/11.” … Bob Lefsetz 
Why does everybody hate us?    We brought this dislike onto ourselves.    In the 1950’s, we hosted the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference – called the Bretton Woods Conference.   It was a gathering of 730 delegates (from all 44 allied nations) at the Mount Washington Hotel, situated in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.   Its focus was to regulate the international monetary and financial order after the conclusion of World War II.   It was at that conference that the world decided to use the U.S. dollar as its global reserve currency.    In the 1960’s, the global leaders saw the U.S. trying to support both domestic social programs, and fight communism abroad.   They realized that we couldn't afford to do both.   They saw the value of all of those ‘dollars’ that they had amassed starting to decline, and began exchanging them for physical gold.  By the end of the 60’s, the gold for dollars’ exchange had turned into a waterfall.   President Nixon watched as the U.S. gold supply declined rapidly, and in 1971 decided to close the gold window – ‘defaulting on the world’.   When Nixon shut the gold window down, he screwed every nation on the planet.   After all, we had implicitly guaranteed Governments the right to exchange paper dollars for gold – and we went back on our word.  The minute we did that, every nation asked the same question: ""What’s backing the U.S. dollar?""  And our answer was: “Nothing but hopes, dreams, and the ability to raise taxes on the middle class.”   In the 1970’s, we found that nations no longer wanted our dollars, especially knowing that we could print more of them on a whim – so they found other ways to exchange them for more tangible assets.   To fight this inflationary problem, the U.S. created the ‘petro-dollar’.   We had OPEC sign a treaty that guaranteed their defense as long as they would only sell oil in U.S. dollars.   Since every nation needed oil, and oil could only be purchased using dollars – that still forced nations to hold U.S. dollars.   To further confound nations, we controlled the only certified, electronic currency exchange system - ‘SWIFT’.   If a country would protest too much, the U.S. would simply turn the ‘SWIFT’ system off for that country.   The U.S. even made a pact with ‘Rothschild based’ central banks.   It seems (back then) if you had a ‘Rothschild based’ central bank, you were often forced to take loans you didn't need, at rates you couldn't afford, and in return – give your country’s resources in exchange.   If your country didn't have a Rothschild central bank – you were on the hit list.  For example: Libya (no Rothschild bank) wanted to exchange gold for their oil – their leader was overthrown and killed.   Iraq (no Rothschild Bank) stopped taking dollars for oil – their leader was overthrown.   Syria (no Rothschild Bank) is taking Euro's, Yuans and gold in exchange for their oil – I wonder what’s going to happen to them?    Fast forward to today, and we find the U.S. watching Russia and China set up foreign exchange banks utilizing Rubles and Yuans, re-establishing the old ‘silk road’ of trade, and excluding the U.S. dollar.   The U.S. knows that the days of being the global reserve currency are coming to an end.   When that goes away, a lot of our financial power goes with it, and will cause us to focus on our military superiority.   So, the game plan since the mid 1990's has been to topple foreign governments, and install U.S. friendly leaders who are good with bribe money in exchange for their country’s resources.    Over in N. Korea, there's little doubt that something is going to happen, and it’s my guess is that we will be going in and taking out the N. Korean leadership.  I think the reason that 150K Chinese are lined up on the N. Korean border is because when the U.S. does make its move, the Chinese will advance and install their own leader.  I don't think the U.S. wants to redevelop N. Korea, we just want Kim out of there, and we’ll let the Chinese mop up the mess.  





“Robots Ate My Job” … David Brancaccio of NPR 
   So, if we’re ramping up for war, where are the jobs?   I mean, if we’re so ‘in control’ of the world, why are we losing so many high-paying jobs?   After all, our labor force participation rate is at its lowest point in over 30 years with almost 100m people being kicked out of the workforce.   Just this week a WTO spokesperson shed some light on that when he said: “8 out of every 10 of the jobs lost in the past 5 years – were eliminated by robots and technology.”   From stand-up comedians in Pennsylvania to blue-collar workers in Indiana, from grocery store clerks in California to an Internet retailer in Arkansas – robots are eating our jobs.    Robotic technology is advancing at an exponential rate.   To visualize what exponential means: if I put a single grain of rice on the first square of a chessboard and double it on every square thereafter.   By the end of the board, I would have a mountain of rice higher than Mt. Everest.   An untold bounty is waiting for people with the advanced robotic skills to take advantage of these developments – but what about the rest of us?   Labor market experts have argued for years that while technology destroys jobs – it ultimately replaces them with more and better jobs.   But this time, many economists are worried about ‘technological unemployment.’   Technologies such as Ai, BI, and robotics will eliminate between 10 and 25M jobs by 2025.   We could be witness to the second ‘industrial revolution’ impacting: employment distribution, shopping patterns, social interactions, manufacturing priorities, and city planning.   Forrester predicts at least 10 million jobs will be lost as a direct result of the robotic revolution, and only 1 new job will be created for every 15 lost.      How did we go from boom to bust so quickly?   The truth is always in the numbers.   In the 1960’s, 70’s and 80’s, to completely pay for the average home, car, and a 4-year education – it took about 4 years’ worth of wages.   That is to say, if you put all of your wages toward only those 3 major items – it would take 4 years to pay them off.   In the 1990’s, that number jumped to a little under 5 years, and in the 2000’s it took 5.25 years for a complete payoff.   But in the post 2010 era, it now takes over 6.25 years’ worth of wages (and climbing) to pay off the average home, car, and 4-year education.   And ‘to add insult to injury’ within the past 10 years, a new player: ‘Healthcare’ is quickly eclipsing the price of an automobile in our lives.   So, in a nutshell we have gone from boom to bust due to over-spending and not managing our costs – specifically on education and healthcare.   Imagine if you were born in the 80’s and had children, you could very well be looking at your children’s college education as a nightmare instead of a blessing.    The bigger problem is: Uncle Sam is no better off.   He’s broke and asking the question – How do I avoid bankruptcy?   He has his eye on John Q. Public’s $3T hidden in IRA’s and personal retirement accounts.   With an economy drowning in debt as we are, a $3T jump start is a great alternative to war.    I wanted to end by wishing everyone a Happy Easter.   No matter how you celebrate the day, please enjoy it and share it with those people most important to you.   Easter serves to remind me that the precious time we have with our loved ones diminishes day by day – so allow today be one that you will remember. 

The Market:    Mike Jackson (the CEO of AutoNation – the largest automobile retailer) took aim at Tesla this week saying that Tesla’s market cap surpassing that of General Motors’ is ""either one of the greatest Ponzi schemes of all time, or is going to magically work out.""   Tesla produced only a fraction of the 10m cars GM made last year.   Tesla has only had two profitable quarters in its history as a public company, while GM earned more than $9B last year alone.   Mike went on to say: “What would impress me about Tesla would be selling vehicles at a profit.   Giving away vehicles at below what it costs you to make them is not very exciting.   And if they can’t make money selling $100,000 cars, I’m very skeptical that moving down to the $35,000 price range with the Model 3 will make them any more profitable.”   Mike went on to point out that consumers keep trending toward less fuel-efficient trucks and SUVs, and our proliferation of hydraulic fracking means that affordable gasoline is here to stay.   Therefore, ""If OPEC was ever again to try a boycott, we could simply tell them to ‘get fracked.’”    I was also taken by an interview that Mrs. Suzy Welch gave on CNBC where she said: ""If there's one thing I wish I had known about business in my 20s, it's that there is this huge, important, powerful, invisible economy out there – that I refer to as the Favor Economy.   It's about putting yourself out on a limb for somebody else with no expectation for immediate payback.   For instance, offering yourself as a reference, placing a call to help someone land a job, or working a weekend or holiday so others can be with their families.   Essentially, its currency is performing small acts of kindness and generosity as a way of life.   The problem is, during college, you hear a lot of messages telling you that success is a zero-sum game — that for you to win, others have to lose.   You hit the work world not sure how much you should be helping others.   Then after a few years of working, most people wake up and realize that likeability and teamwork matter, often more than talent.”   Mrs. Welch urges people to start their careers knowing that the Favor Economy is there, and understand that you're a player in it.  Either you participate, which is good, or you don't, which is definitely going to hold you back.  Her advice was: “The more we help, the more successful we will become.""  


   Very simply, the NASDAQ is down as of late because Apple can NOT buy back its own stock.  Looking at the market capitalization of the top S&P companies: (a) Apple $743B, (b) Google $574B, (c) Microsoft $506B, (d) Amazon $430B, and (e) Facebook $408B – over 20% of the entire stock market’s net worth lies in our top 10 names.  Apple alone is larger than the entire Utilities sector, the Real Estate sector, the Materials sector, and the Telecommunications sector.  Apple is 5 TIMES the size of the top 3 U.S. automakers combined.  Some people think that Target is a competitor of Amazon.  Target’s net worth is $29.6B, and Amazon increased that much in seven days.  Remember, when you invest in an S&P 500 index fund – over 20% of your money is going into the top 10 names.    In market-land, could this be the vaunted correction that has been hiding in the wings for so long?  Maybe, but we've seen this movie so many times before that it has become a game of ‘Chicken Little’.   The market starts to roll over, people start to panic, and then (out of the blue) it roars higher.  Technically the market is in trouble.   The S&P, the DOW, the Russell (IWM), the Financials (XLF), the Semi's (SMH), and others are all below their 50-day moving averages.  But for the bulls, there's one last glimmer of hope.   Using the DOW as an example: -        On March 27 th , the low of the day was 20,412 – then it reversed its slide and ended the day at 20,550.  On Thursday, the DOW closed at 20,453 – above the March 27 th intraday low. -        The S&P on March 27 th , hit an intraday low of 2,322 before reversing.   We closed Thursday at 2,328 – above that March 27 th intraday low.     On Monday, we could see those intraday lows hold support and get a bounce.  As I write this, April 15 th in N. Korea has passed.  Speculation was that N. Korea was going to test a nuclear weapon on the 15 th , which would have started an invasion.  Maybe Trump's ability to get the Chinese involved worked, and avoided war.  If the market decides that this is great news, those intraday lows may hold, and we will see a market bounce on Monday.  However, if this is correction time, the next stops down would probably be 2,300 and then at 2,280 on the S&P.  So, one good headline and we could be in bounce mode – and one bad one and the slide continues lower.  Have a blessed holiday! 

Tips: 

   Donald Trump's presidency is the best thing to happen to the gold market in years.  Everything Trump has done over the past week has been positive for gold. The Syrian airbase strike, increasing tensions with North Korea, and his comments on the U.S. dollar – have all caused gold prices to swell nearly 3% in the past five days alone.  This is a trend we can expect to continue.  Increasing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the entire world will no doubt boil into a military conflict somewhere.  But geopolitical instability is just one of the catalysts preparing to launch gold prices into the stratosphere.  In a Wall Street Journal interview, President Trump signaled that he was also prepared to wage a currency war.  Trump is only 84 days into his presidency – a mere 6% of his 4-year term.  He has plenty of time to make more political enemies via Twitter.    In terms of silver, the 50-day moving average just recently crossed the 100-day moving average, and it seems as if the 200-day moving average has just started a new bullish trend.   If silver trades above the 200-day for a few sessions, that reinforces a bullish shift that I could certainly get behind.    I’m looking at a couple mining plays (PAAS, GDXJ) that have weak historical correlation with the S&P 500, and therefore present a potential long opportunity going forward.   I also like a couple slightly higher negative correlations to the S&P that include bonds (TLT), and the emerging markets ETF (EEM).    I’m watching: -        GS (Goldman Sachs) – they have earnings on Tuesday and should move higher.   Therefore, selling the April 21 st -220 / + 217.5 Put Credit Spread and buying the +222.50 / -230 Call Debit Spread should work nicely. -        PAAS (a silver miner) – could use a rest, but buying the July out-of-the-money +20 / -22 Call Debit Spread should work as long as SLV remains above its 200-day moving average. -        GDXJ (a Junior Miner ETF) – should stay contained over the next month – so selling a May Strangle -   -33 Put / -44 Call could work nicely.

First off, don’t panic! Unless you have a really poor password, it’s unlikely that you have been hacked. Instead an annoying person has just created a new Facebook account, copied your profile picture and name, and is presumably now going through your friend list asking to become friends, and confusing all your friends who thought you were already their friend. What can you do? 
Use the Facebook “Report” function to ask Facebook to delete the fake account. Open the fake profile page (Just click on the name) Click on the ‘ …’ button (to the right of the Message button), then click Report . Select Report this profile and click Continue Select They're pretending to be me or someone I know and click Continue Select Me and click Continue Select Submit to Facebook for Review Usually within a matter of hours, someone at Facebook will review the details and shut down the offending account. How can you reduce the risk of this happening?

[Editor’s Note: To celebrate the work being done on intimate stages in Los Angeles, the Center Theatre Group (CTG) is producing Block Party at the Kirk Douglas Theatre. CTG received 76 submissions from intimate theatre companies throughout the L.A. area. Each company was able to submit one production that opened between January 1, 2015, and August 12, 2016. Three were selected, and each will now be given a two-week run. Tonight, the first of the three shows, Coeurage Theatre’s whimsically uplifting, emotionally devastating, theatrically inventive Failure: A Love Story began its short run. Two years ago, Stage and Cinema ’s writer Jason Rohrer wrote an unassailable review that captured this gem’s essence perfectly. When asked if he wished to write a review of this newly mounted production, he wrote, “Two years ago, at the 98-seat Grove Theater Center, I saw the best show I’d ever seen in an intimate house. Tonight I watched the same production revived at the much larger, 317-seat Kirk Douglas Theatre. The difference is substantial. It is now the best show I’ve seen in a mid-size house.” Indeed, this is the richest, most satisfying play in memory, and may be one of the best shows you will ever see in your life. Here are the photos. Don’t miss it.]

This week we started our link-up; Monday Highlights! I really enjoyed it - thank you to everyone who joined in and we will be doing it again tomorrow. If you would like to take part you can just share a link to your favourite recent blog post (one you are proud of or enjoyed making) and we can visit. We're hoping it will encourage new blog discoveries and also give us an opportunity to interact more with blogs we do follow! 

This post is slightly late going up today because yesterday we went to the zoo! And apparently it exhausted me so much I overslept! It was a lot of fun and our little brother got to do the Keeper for a Day experience which he loves so that was exciting! 
Films of the Week: I'm honestly still recovering from my Chronicles of Lizzie Borden binge but I've been trying to watch the recommended shows/films on Netflix. So far I haven't found anything that's really caught my interest so if you have any suggestions let me know!  
Last Week on the Blog: Monday Highlights #1  Ann Reviews: Remnants by Carolyn Arnold Wednesday Catch-Up Clare Reviews: Defy the Stars by Claudia Gray Friday Reads Spring Into Horror TBR and Goals Clare Reviews: The Beast of London by L.D. Goffigan 
Books We Got This Week: Ann: 
Promises I Made by Michelle Zink: Clare ordered this for me a month ago because I loved the first book and it's taken a while to arrive! But I am very excited to read it! 
Clare: 
Ararat by Christopher Golden:  Received for review from Headline, I am SO excited for this and it arrived just in time for Spring Into Horror as well so I'll definitely be reading this in the next couple of weeks!! Every Last Lie by Mary Kubica:  Thank you to HQ and Netgalley for this one! I'm really excited for it (my love affair with thrillers continues) but its not released until the end of July so will have to hold off for a bit! Close to Me by Amanda Reynolds: I recently took part in a blog tour for this book and the publisher was kind enough to send me a copy for review! This will again be perfect for Spring Into Horror (lining up SO many good reads). 
Crimson & Bone by Marina Fiorato:  Many thanks to the publisher for sending me a copy of this! Marina Fiorato is probably my favourite Historical Fiction writer so I am super excited for this! 
The White Road by Sarah Lotz: I am so excited for this you wouldn't believe it! The publisher sent me an ARC for review and it just sounds exactly my kind of book! Will definitely be reading this for Spring Into Horror as well! 
The Wages of Sin by Kaite Welsh:  This is one I've been wanting for a while so I was thrilled to get it on Netgalley!  
Maplecroft by Cherie Priest: Ever since watching The Lizzie Borden Chronicles I've been on a big Lizzie Borden kick - this was the best looking of all the Lizzie Borden books I found so I am excited for it!  
The Upside of Unrequited by Becky Albertalli: For a swift change in tone (seriously so much horror/thrillers this week) - this looks like a cute and fun contemporary. I adored Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda so I am looking forward to this! 
Hunted by Meagan Spooner: Beauty and the Beast retelling. Plus it's got amazing reviews so far!  
Reading Update: Clare: 
Blood Rose Rebellion by Rosalyn Eves: 2 stars, I had quite a lot of problems with this throughout - it's a very American view of Hungary and of England (although I am sure Rosalyn Eves did her best) so there are quite a few misrepresentations and generalisations which is always frustrating. But mostly - I just didn't like Anna. Her decision making was childish and nonsensical and although she had some character growth it wasn't enough to make me like her.  Defy the Stars by Claudia Gray: 3 stars, Just kind of underwhelming. I didn't dislike it but I didn't really care about any of the characters either which made me feel a little heartless. My review of this is already up! The Beast of London by L.D. Goffigan: 4.5 stars, So very good. Atmospheric, great characters an intriguing mystery! Just everything I was hoping for! My review for this went up yesterday!

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence arrives at the border village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) which has separated the two Koreas since the Korean War, South Korea, Monday, April 17, 2017. (Associated Press) 
TOKYO - The United States did not need to respond to North Korea’s latest missile launch because it was a failure, the White House said Sunday, as Vice President Mike Pence arrived in Seoul on the first leg of a four-country trip to Asia. 
As Pence was departing from Alaska - a day after a huge military parade in Pyongyang - North Korea launched a ballistic missile that exploded within a few seconds.

North Korea had been expected to do something provocative to mark the most important day on the regime’s calendar, the April 15 anniversary of founder Kim Il Sung’s birthday. 
Tensions in the region had been running high amid expectations of a nuclear test or a missile launch, with President Trump vowing to “properly deal with” North Korea if China would not. 
But a White House foreign policy adviser traveling with Pence said that the United States did not need to take action “to reinforce their failure.” North Korea has fired numerous medium-range missiles, as Sunday’s appeared to be, so one more made little difference. 
“If it had been a nuclear test, then other actions would have been taken from the U.S.,” the adviser told reporters on the vice president’s plane. 
Some analysts were puzzled by this. 
“I’m not sure why failed missile tests, which are still banned by the U.N. Security Council, are considered less provocative,” said Kent Boydston, a North Korea-focused research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The North Koreans know they may fail, but they improve their capabilities each time.” 
Indeed, while the latest missile exploded soon after launch, experts say North Korea is able to learn from its mistakes and hone its technology. It had repeated failures with other missiles, including the medium-range Musudan and a submarine-launched ballistic missile, before successfully firing both. 
Pence made a surprise visit to the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea on Monday, one day after Kim’s regime launched the missile. 
North Korea’s behavior will be the focus of Pence’s trip to Asia, with a senior administration official saying the vice president would be discussing “the belligerency of North Korea” at every stop. 
After stopping in Seoul, Pence is to travel to Tokyo; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Sydney. 
North Korea’s missiles are a particularly complicated issue in South Korea. 
The conservative government of former president Park Geun-hye, who was removed from office last month after her impeachment in December, had agreed to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, antimissile system to defend against North Korea’s rockets. 
South Korea made this decision last July after much equivocation. China strongly objects to the THAAD battery - in particular its radar system, which Beijing worries will be used to peer into China. 
Beijing has made its unhappiness known with a wide economic boycott that includes K-pop concerts, toilet-seat imports and tour group travel to South Korea. 
Now, South Korea is heading toward a snap presidential election May 9 to replace Park, and the THAAD system is a core issue. 
Moon Jae-in, the progressive candidate who had been leading in the polls, has promised to review the previous government’s decision to host THAAD. Apparently sensing a worsening political environment, the U.S. military sped up the deployment to try to get everything in place before the election. 
But now Moon faces a strong challenge from a more centrist candidate, Ahn Cheol-soo, who has said that he will respect the Park administration’s agreement with the United States. 
“It’s a critical point for the defense of South Korea in recognizing it’s not an offensive weapon. It’s there to prevent rockets slamming from the North Koreans,” an American official said while previewing Pence’s trip. 
The complicating factor here is China. It wants the missile battery gone, and the United States wants China to crack down on North Korea. Although Trump had a cordial summit with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Florida this month, the North Korea issue threatens to drive a wedge between them. 
China on Friday warned that “storm clouds” were gathering. 
Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged the United States and North Korea not to push their recriminations to a point of no return and allow war to break out on the peninsula. 
On Sunday, China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, spoke to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by telephone, and the two “exchanged views on the current situation on the Korean Peninsula,” China’s foreign ministry said in a statement. 
China said it cut off coal imports from North Korea in February, in accordance with U.N. Security Council sanctions. 
The Global Times, an English-language Chinese newspaper that does not necessarily reflect official policy, recommended that Beijing convey a clear message to Pyongyang: that if it conducts a sixth nuclear test, the Chinese government would support stiffer U.N. sanctions to cut off “the vast majority” of its oil supplies to North Korea. 
The U.S. Navy sent a strike group to Korean waters last week, but defense officials have said tougher sanctions and pressure was still the favored approach to dealing with North Korea. 
“We’ve got a range of options, both militarily, diplomatic and others … at disposal for the president should he choose to use them,” the White House foreign policy adviser told reporters on Air Force Two. “But for this particular case [of the failed missile launch] … we don’t need to expend any resources against that.” 
Tensions are expected to continue for several weeks at least. 
Large-scale annual exercises between the South Korean and U.S. militaries will continue until the end of April, and North Korea will mark another important date - the anniversary of the foundation of the Korean People’s Army - on April 25.

Google published ""It's Lit: A guide to what teens think is cool,"" a ""magazine"" compiling the results of its research into Generation Z, characterized as those aged from 13 to 17. 
The Google-funded research found Generation Z relied on brands to ""shape their world,"" and that Google was the third-most cool. Cool was defined by the researchers as ""unique, impressive, interesting, amazing, or awesome."" 
YouTube, which Google owns, came out at number one ahead of Netflix. Google's web browser Chrome placed tenth, in front of Nike. 
1,100 teenagers aged 13-17 were asked to rank 122 brands by coolness and awareness. 
YouTube, Google and Netflix ranked highly by both. 
According to the surveyed teens, McDonalds, Yahoo, and Facebook Messenger were high-profile but not cool. 
Doritos and Oreo were cool. 
Vice was not cool. 
Overall, the least cool brands were TMZ, the Wall Street Journal, Sprint and Yahoo. Respondents were least aware of Uniqlo, Patagonia and Supreme. 
But those surveyed for the Google study were united in their appreciation of Google, with Millennials describing it as ""serious and functional"" and Generation Z finding it more ""fun and functional."" 
A 17-year-old woman in suburban Florida was quoted as saying that Google was ""not only a powerful search engine, but great at everything it does, from email to documents."" 
""Teens love learning and knowing"" was researchers' conclusion. 
The study stated that 42.2% of Generation Z respondents used its social network Google Plus, putting it ahead of Twitter (35.4%) and Pinterest (26.6%) and only a little over 10% behind Facebook. 
But the finding betrays the fact that a Google Plus account comes part and parcel with use of its other services such as Gmail. An independent study in 2015 suggested fewer than 1% of Google's 2.2 billion users were active on Google Plus. 
Responding to the research on social media, many expressed scepticism as to its validity. 
""This study is a great piece of native advertising for Google services,"" tweeted one technology commentator.

MORE IN SALES & MARKETING YouTube Cracks Down on Fake News Channels with Ad Changes PUBLISHED: 07 2017 YouTube announced Thursday it is cracking down on fake news channels by no longer placing advertising on them until they've reached 10,000 overall views. 
YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., also the parent company of Google, announced changes after several big companies pulled their advertising from the company because their ads were appearing with objectionable content. 
The online video service said the changes are designed to make sure channels are legitimate and not stealing content. 
""We will no longer serve ads on YPP videos until the channel reaches 10K lifetime views,"" Ariel Bardin, vice president of product management, said in a statement. ""This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel. It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. By keeping the threshold to 10K views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators. And, of course, any revenue earned on channels with under 10K views up until today will not be impacted."" 
YouTube is also adding a review process for creators to join the YouTube Partner Program, which began in 2007. 
""After a creator hits 10K lifetime views on their channel, we'll review their activity against our policies,"" Bardin said. ""If everything looks good, we'll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content. Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules."" 
The company, in an effort to help creators reach 10,000, will offer tips on ""making great original content and growing your audience."" 
""We want creators of all sizes to find opportunity on YouTube, and we believe this new application process will help ensure creator revenue continues to grow and end up in the right hands,"" Bardin said. 
In the past, the open-ended policy allowed amateur video creators to earn money and some work became viral and earned a considerable amount. 
Several advertisers, including Walmart, General Motors, JPMorgan Chase, Pepsico, Starbucks and Johnson & Johnson, pulled out of YouTube after their ads appeared in extremist hate-speech videos. 
On March 24, the head of the Association of National Advertisers, which represents 1,000 companies that spend more than $250 billion in marketing and advertising each year, urged Google to change its policy. 
""ANA strongly believes that brand safety is of paramount importance to our members,"" Bob Liodice said in statement. ""The current crisis is representative of the issues that ANA -- and others -- have raised with respect to fraud and risk, reduced transparency, sub-optimum measurement and nebulous productivity."" 
YouTube didn't say how many accounts would be affected by the change. 
Advertisers pay roughly $7 to $12 for 1,000 views and creators split the money with YouTube, The Wall Street Journal reported. 
""What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn't match,"" Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said last month in an interview with Fox Business Network. 
YouTube has more than a billion users and as of last July, it had paid out $2 billion to rightsholders, the company said on its website.

For a couple of hours last week, Britain didn’t seem such a bad place after all. Despite all the… stuff . This was achieved, will wonders never cease, by a couple of programmes about, essentially, driving.
Few people other than the most crashing snobs can dislike Peter Kay. His northern humour may not be to absolutely every single taste, but you’d have to be called something like Peregrine Spunktrumpet to actively eject yourself from his presence. His second series of Car Share kicked off with the usual series of conversations with co-worker Kayleigh, except that now she’s having to commute, these perforce took place on mobile phone. It’s everything low-level infuriating about modern life – traffic jams, lost phone signals, the actionable mediocrity of Forever FM , the fact that two people can’t manage a simple commute without phoning each other eight times despite having nothing to say. Somehow, in Kay’s hands – the set condensed into, essentially, his car and sweeping blurs of a Tesco-liveried Manchester – we learn to forgive, even like, modern life. The staff nights out, the low-level road rage ( you’re the dickhead, you… dickhead”), the marketing that treats us as infants, even, ulp, S Club 7. A splendid Sian Gibson, as Kayleigh, is obviously so right for Mr Kay, but let’s hope this all remains unrequited for the moment, at least for this too-short four-parter. True, it’s so warm-hearted it can sometimes feel like like having a bath with your socks on, but just when you think you know where it’s going along, will come a savage flash of witty, angry, sublime self-perception.
What a surprise was The Knowledge , a sadly one-off foray allowing cameras into the exam centre for London’s black-cab drivers. This could have been bordering on turbid: instead, focusing on the divergent candidates’ very sweats as they gulped their way through the final “appearance”, it was rendered mesmerising.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Who’d have thought we would invest so much?’: The Knowledge. Photograph: Channel 4 Television
Four years’ average study , a 70% dropout rate, 25,000 streets and 100,000 landmarks to memorise, the hideous Uber snarling at their heels, yet still, who’d have thought that we could invest so much in willing people to remember you can’t set down on the right at St Mary Axe, and how to get from the Royal British Society of Sculptors to the Royal Institute of British Architects. We learned about plasticity of brain: we learned that no one’s too old to grow clever, despite having been constantly told they’re thick.
The eventual exams – there was a nicely old-fashioned air about these, with most candidates dressed in ties, and it was all “nice to see you again… I’m still Mr Whitehead, you’re still Mr Tilfrey,” – had you rooting for everyone, after four winters on scooters with their daughters’ hot-water bottles up their jerseys. And there were tears, from hard-bitten men and women, on getting that green-gold badge. “Ten foot tall. Feel ten foot tall.” “I won’t stop smiling for a month.” It was, honestly, every bit as exciting as that last University Challenge . As the programme said, keep an eye out for Dave, for Paul, for Kosovan Saimir, next time you’re in the capital, and I will too. My pal the jazz pianist Ian passed the test a few years ago, and similarly speaks of a new lease of life: he’s since persuaded TfL to adorn his cab with “Ride with Pride” rainbow livery, so watch out for that and – shameless plug alert – his song Over the Westway , a real cabbie’s fresh take on the unloved flyover.
What, quite, to make of how this nice Britain all compares to the London of 1971 as depicted in Guerrilla , an Idris Elba production notably written by John Ridley, the man responsible for the 12 Years a Slave script? The Spectator has already labelled it “Self-flagellatory pornography designed for white liberal pillocks” , and that was just the headline – compared to the review itself, it was mealy-mouthed pantywaisting.
I’m far less inclined to be so censorious, but then I’m far less generally inclined to the taking of recreational offence. True, some of it bordered, politically, on the cartoonish. White people, from the torn-faced lip-purser on the bus to the absurd racism of the Met police, verging on the Not the Nine’o’Clock News “possession of curly black hair and thick lips” sketch, do not come out of this well. Ever. Unless they’re Irish. Or Marxist-Leninist. And… um, but did we truly have quite so many black activists being murdered openly on the streets of London, even in 1971? I think we might have read about that.
For all that, it’s an honestly valuable, if wholly imagined, testament to the mood of the times, with some viscerally shocking scenes and an utterly credible mood of menace. Rory Kinnear , with his tenderly rightwing face, and Daniel Mays excel as the toxic Rhodesian-tinted “black power desk” of the Met, as does Babou Ceesay as the rebel without a clue. Babou’s nice liberal teacher Marcus aids the escape of a black “political prisoner” – actually jailed for stabbing someone in an off-licence raid – and this is meant to be (I think) a tale of how well-meant activism can, when provoked by cold concrete establishment prejudice, lead to escalating madnesses. But Marcus and his accomplice (the oddly miscast Freida Pinto) have nothing to exactly rail against, other than nebulous dissatisfaction with their lot.

I can’t imagine that 1971 was anything like a dander through Paradise Garden for any black person in London. Sometimes, though, this feels like being poked too repeatedly, pointlessly, in the ribs with a reversed sjambok.
It’s neck and neck now between Line of Duty and Broadchurch , which has suddenly come up on the rails. David Tennant finally showed his fangs – his “cut off your tiny little cocks” speech, despite being a teensy bit tautologous and delivered to nothing more menacing than a bunch of no-mark slouchers, had elements of his Shakespearian grandeur. Jed Mercurio’s Line of Duty shocked and brilliantly appalled again. Sweaty sofas again early next week. Finally, destination TV returns. It had, after all, been on nothing more than a destination holiday.

Building holders whose tile grout has peeled off or dirty are recommended to employ competent service providers for repairs. There are hundreds of providers in this area thus, locating them need not be a problem. What property owners should know is that some providers are not capable of quality performance. A detailed search is mandatory when looking for capable contractors. When in need of assistance with satisfactory tile regrouting New York City providers can be found on the internet or locally.

The material, normally cream in color seen between the floor tiles is called grout. What needs to be known is that this material can get dirty quickly and discolor thus making your look appear unattractive. The best thing to do when the grout has peeled off or dirty is to apply another one. The work would require you to buy quality materials as well as hire a reliable contractor.

Homeowners looking for tile regrouting contractors in New York City should browse the web. When on the internet, it is assured that you would obtain a good number of contractors ready to do the work. The good thing is that service providers have websites thus knowing their locations and obtaining contacts is easy. To carry out a fruitful search, you will need a PC and reliable data connectivity. It is also necessary to apply precise keywords during the search.

Another way of finding contractors is through referrals. Since you have neighbors who have tied floors, it is likely that they have contacts of reliable contractors. What you need to do is approach them for recommendations. If your neighbor is sure about the service quality of a contractor, he or she would forward the contacts.

Because your aim is to obtain quality services, ensure to pick the most suitable contractor. The duration a professional has been in the industry is the first thing you must consider. This simply means that you want a properly experienced contractor. It needs to be clear that skilled contractors have necessary tools for the work.

The operation permit a provider holds is another key thing you must consider checking. It is obvious that the job to be performed is within your house. Because you own valuables, it will be unfortunate to notice that some are stolen or damaged. This is the main reason you must make sure to check the work license legitimacy of a provider so that you can have him answerable for any wrongdoing.

Tile regrouting would require you to buy some materials. You should also know that the contractor would require the service charge. To know how much the work would require, ensure to invite a number of contractors to carry out the job assessment and offer quotes. Once the estimates are in, make a review and choose contractor whose pricing is reasonable.

Property owners looking for help with tile regrouting are recommended to employ competent local providers. Contractors can be found through a wide internet search or transfers. When selecting a service provider, be sure to consider his skills and work permit validity.

President Donald Trump’s order of a missile strike on a military base in retaliation for the Syrian government’s deadly chemical attack on civilians served as a strong, decisive message to bad actors worldwide, congressional Republicans say, and signified the new administration would hew closely to the traditional concept of American power. Kill Your Cable Bill! Just $2 a month 
In interviews with The Daily Signal, Republicans of all stripes said they were OK that Trump did not consult Congress before he authorized the strike, in which 59 cruise missiles hit a Syrian air base early Friday morning local time. 
It was the first U.S. military action against the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country’s six years of civil war. 
But as the Trump administration hints at a tougher approach to the Assad regime, Republican lawmakers say they expect to have a greater influence on future military action. 
“With this very positive action in Syria, the president has now brought to the forefront the need for a discussion between Congress and the administration about strategy going forward,” said Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., a freshman lawmaker and Vietnam War veteran. “This event has become a catalyst for the next logical step that we have to have as a country. It’s an opportunity for us as a country to show collaborative leadership within our system.” 
>>> After Missile Attack, the Challenges Facing Trump in Syria 
Bergman called for the Trump administration to propose an official Authorization for Use of Military Force for Congress to review. Rather than delineating a specific strategy, an AUMF—as the authorization is known—gives the basic legal authority for the U.S. military to use force against an enemy. 
“Congress cannot be disengaged,” Bergman told The Daily Signal in an interview. “We need to be involved in creating an AUMF of the future and understand this not a political game. This is about national security.” 
“Congress cannot be disengaged,” says @RepJackBergman. 
How Congress Can Authorize Force 
The Trump administration, like its predecessor, is carrying out a military campaign against the Islamic State terrorist group, also known as ISIS, in multiple countries, including Syria. 
It takes these actions under an existing AUMF from 2001 permitting the targeting of groups connected to the 9/11 attacks and the 2002 AUMF authorizing the Iraq War. 
President Barack Obama, in his second term, urged Congress to give him new authority to use force against ISIS, but there was bipartisan reluctance to do so and lawmakers never took a full vote on such an authorization. 
After the U.S. missile strikes last week, some lawmakers—of both parties—said Trump should seek congressional approval for an AUMF that specifically authorizes the U.S. military to fight Assad. 
Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said it would not be appropriate to use the 2001 authorization, which was intended to fight al-Qaeda, because the Assad regime “is certainly not connected to that group.” 
“If you go back to the Federalist Papers, the Constitution is clear the commander in chief is the commander when the military is in the field, but Congress and the American people are responsible for calling out the military to move into battle—whether it’s through a war declaration or authorization for use of military force,” Lankford, a member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said in an interview with The Daily Signal. 
Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said she supported Trump’s decision to strike the Syrian air base, but that Congress should consider any proposed future military action in Syria. 
“If the president intends to escalate the U.S. military’s involvement in Syria, he must come to Congress for an Authorization for Use of Military Force which is tailored to meet the threat and prevent another open-ended war in the Middle East,” Pelosi said in a prepared statement to reporters. . @SpeakerRyan , Congress must do its duty & come back into session at once to debate use of military force in Syria. https://t.co/hcxcyN9UUC pic.twitter.com/eJNO4D6Gor 
— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) April 7, 2017 
Needed: ‘Clear Plan to Win’ 
Some Republican lawmakers interviewed by The Daily Signal were more nuanced in their views, saying they are prepared to wait for the Trump administration to first firm up a broader strategy for the Syrian conflict before proposing any future force. 
“No recent president in decades has ever needed to go to Congress for such a single strike occasion,” Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in an interview with The Daily Signal. “That’s exactly the type of situation where the president is given authority under the Constitution to act. I do expect and feel confident the president will brief members of Congress when we return [from Easter recess], and I think we will be brought up to date on what the policy might be and future actions might be. We will have to wait and see if it scales to an all-out war.” 
So far, Trump’s strategy is unclear. 
During the presidential campaign, Trump emphasized his focus in Syria would be on defeating ISIS, which maintains its base in that country. And in the early weeks of his administration, the White House articulated that facilitating the removal of Assad from power was not a priority. 
Last week, Trump’s calculus seemed to change when the president said the chemical weapons attack had “crossed a lot of lines for me” and that his attitude toward Syria and Assad “has changed very much.” 
White House press secretary Sean Spicer seemed to suggest Monday that Trump would act against Syria not just if it again used chemical weapons, but also when it used conventional munitions such as barrel bombs—powerful explosive devices often filled with shrapnel. 
The Syrian Network for Human Rights estimates the Syrian government dropped 12,958 barrel bombs in 2016, resulting in the deaths of 653 civilians. 
“If you gas a baby, if you put a barrel bomb into innocent people, I think you will see a response from this president,” Spicer said in his daily briefing. 
‘Nothing Has Changed’ 
Spicer walked back and clarified his comment later Monday. 
“Nothing has changed in our posture,” Spicer said in a statement to reporters. “The president retains the option to act in Syria against the Assad regime whenever it is in the national interest, as was determined following that government’s use of chemical weapons against its own citizens.” 
Other Trump administration officials in recent days have sought to downplay the prospects for future military action against the Assad regime. 
Defense Secretary James Mattis, speaking to reporters Tuesday, said the administration’s priority in Syria “remains the defeat of ISIS.” 
“Our military policy in Syria has not changed,” Mattis said. 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is meeting with Russian government officials this week, told reporters that the U.S. seeks a negotiated resolution to the Syrian civil war and wants Moscow’s help in pushing Assad from power. 
“The final outcome does not provide a role for Assad or the Assad family in the future governance in Syria,” Tillerson said in a Wednesday news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. 
Trump, in an interview on Fox Business that aired Wednesday morning, said simply: “We’re not going into Syria.” 
Later Wednesday, Trump called Assad “a butcher” and said U.S. relations with Russia could be at an “all-time low.” 
“Right now, we’re not getting along with Russia at all—we may be at an all-time low in terms of a relationship with Russia,” Trump said during a news conference at the White House with Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO . “This has built for a long period of time, but we’re going to see what happens.” 
Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Trump administration should clearly articulate its priorities in Syria to Congress. 
“I am someone who believes strongly we should never send troops into harm’s way unless we have a clear plan to win,” Zeldin told The Daily Signal in an interview, adding: 
Part of executing a strategy to win includes getting everybody on the same page to what winning looks like. There is debate that will take place whether Assad should stay in power, and what role the U.S. should have in the region and around the world. While not every part of this debate should be televised for the adversary to see, at the same time there is a responsibility to ensure we are making the right decisions so that the American public is supportive of our efforts. 
Lankford said the Trump administration ought to be focused both on defeating ISIS and helping to remove Assad, because the Syrian dictator’s leadership fuels terrorism. 
“We hope Assad’s status is resolved diplomatically, but you can’t do diplomacy without a credible military threat behind it,” the Oklahoma Republican said. #Syria Pres. Bashar al-Assad’s brutality murders innocent people, creates regional chaos & contributes to the growth of ISIS. #Assad must go 
— Sen. James Lankford (@SenatorLankford) April 7, 2017 
If the Trump administration does not provide “a clearly articulated vision” for its strategy in Syria, Lankford said, “Congress should not move forward on any action.” 
“No one knows what the American policy is in Syria right now, and what it stands for and will not stand for,” Lankford said. “None of our allied countries in the region will help in the fight unless they know where America stands. The Trump administration has to fix that or the international community will have no reason to engage.” 
Constitution ‘Pretty Clear’ 
Other Republican lawmakers are more specific about what set of U.S. actions in Syria should require congressional oversight. 
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Congress should review any proposed “boots on the ground” in Syria dedicated to targeting the Assad regime. 
“The Constitution is pretty clear, you are gonna have a debate in the Congress,” Jordan said in a speech Tuesday in his home district that was attended by a Daily Signal reporter. “That’s the way the founders laid this thing out. If it’s gonna escalate, if it’s gonna be something with boots on the ground or anything like that, I think we’ve got to be real careful about that, and it would warrant a full debate in the House and the Senate before we go any further.” 
Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., also of the Freedom Caucus, said he expects the Trump administration to pursue a diplomatic solution to the Syrian civil war—as Obama did. 
But if Trump failed, and then sought military action against Assad, Congress should have a say, Harris said. 
“If further escalation involving serious military force is necessary, the president should consult with Congress first,” Harris told The Daily Signal in an interview. 
“If further escalation involving serious military force is necessary, the president should consult with Congress first,” says @RepAndyHarrisMD. 
“For instance, if the administration decides its diplomatic efforts weren’t working and decided they needed to attack the Syrian air force, that is probably something they should obtain congressional approval for,” Harris said. 
He doesn’t believe Trump would need Congress’ blessing if the president sought to create no-fly and safe zones in Syria to protect civilians, the Maryland Republican added. 
‘Part of the Action’ 
In the interviews, the Republican lawmakers were not unified in describing how Congress should be incorporated into Trump’s Syria plan. 
The GOP lawmakers appear prepared to give the president some freedom now that he has shown himself not to be wedded to the isolationist foreign policy approach he espoused in the campaign. 
“I think President Trump has a lot different view of the world than candidate Trump,” Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., said in an interview with The Daily Signal. “He won’t sit back and say, ‘This is how I want the world to be’ without regard for the facts of a given situation.” 
“This president is an action guy,” Kelly said, “and I trust he will rely on the advice given by his military advisers. But Congress does need to be a part of the action. That’s our responsibility constitutionally, and I would never walk away from that.”

I have a short friend who insists on wearing bright clothes. Adam’s theory is that his gaudy wardrobe distracts people from his lack of vertical presence. I’ve never been convinced. However, this week I’ve been driving Audi’s dinky Q2 in “Vegas Yellow”. So who better to help test it than a small man in a garish suit?
Like Adam, the Q2 has all the style and class of a grown-up car in a diminutive package. The market for these “compact” SUVs is one of the liveliest, but until now has been dominated by cheaper offerings, such as Nissan’s Juke, Vauxhall’s Mokka and Renault’s Captur. Audi is the first premium builder to enter the fray. And if you throw money at a problem you tend to get instant results: in terms of pure drivability, ride quality, interior comfort and big-car tech, the Q2 absolutely wipes the floor with the rest of them. It’s easily the best compact SUV on the market – give or take a few grand.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Inside story: the interior of the little Q2 has all the feel and finesse of a much bigger car
It’s great to look at – the boxy shape is accentuated by the squared running lines and sharp clefts. Like many small cars, the Q2 offers plenty of scope for customisation: it comes in 12 colour options; the C-pillar “blade” and bumpers come in a further five contrast colours; the LED lighting has illuminated inlays in a choice of 10 colours; and alloy wheels are offered in four different sizes. All this gets a thumbs-up from Adam, who has long exploited the power of an arresting colour clash.
Inside, the level of finish is extraordinary for such a small car, with a doll’s house attention to detail. It’s a five-seater, though the back row is rather tight. The boot, however, is unexpectedly roomy and has a useful removable shelf.
The “Virtual Cockpit” – Audi’s term for its digital dash – is a delight. You can select from several screen displays and all command prompts come with a mixture of easy-to-hit buttons. You can also add full smartphone connectivity.
A car this size is a great opportunity for you to sidestep a diesel engine and its attendant NOx emissions, and go for a petrol unit. The clean-burning 1-litre 116bhp three-cylinder turbo is the smallest in the line-up but offers plenty of what Audi calls “go-kart feel”. That’s the last thing I want in a sophisticated drive and the description does the Q2 a disservice. It’s a real QT – light, smooth, nimble and surprisingly composed on the motorway.
This baby Audi offers big car comforts in a small car frame. Or, as Adam said: “It’s a little guy that punches above its weight.”

From my situation is really great pit exit do you still double semi different hats and it's dees mean different things and give it a success in monitors. Just the panel on it to him in line there's you know people who means there's personal injury would we ever master Edward. It's a different where is it and in some friends of mine approximately experience in Moscow now and they've only been working media one firm because one thing would be just a personal injury just you. One kind of deal suit you know they don't have a blood expert or anything else I really always like at a kind of Hadley. The united is always had to learn a different avenue way different. Route for all our different subjects that we handled as we really handled. So many different things it's kind of an overwhelming bay it's fun at the same time the kind of keeps a different you know it's not an honest right. It's it's it's sought changes with the need woody woody woody woody findings saying. As far as. It if you check may be at peace on to I think I'd like to do and be good. I like when we do it I guess I guess. Like injury claims that like to do all that medical stuff I have to go on is a little bit of a mind efforts that so I like to do all the calculations. In. I like to get thrown at a crackers I find it there and seeing some people finance boring but. For me I kind of think it's interesting I think is and seeing like. All the different avenues of procedures and all the medications now it would start today you get a lot more versed in the language. So that's easier and easier balance on eighty. Ned now are renewed. Either way cleanest and I thought that might be interesting but down all the things interesting but that's something I understand that I wouldn't think I would have found interesting on top editors dry habit actually quite. Today is a lot lot that's document intensive. And so like in a lot of issues you have an a personal injury case is he might have someone who's. Late fifties early sixties he'd gotten car commander to back. And in the issues. Where was back before the accident you know how was a function and and has exacerbated there always agree with something with something else there before. And and then figured out because. Figure out. You know the deed to the extent it was damaged due to the. Little bit of its little bit of a medical and financial puzzle to put together a kind of like that puzzle which I yakking that's why the eighty succession. Would be kind of media rally is wild sky and really structured type of law. Now eyes and he is interesting you brought that up because we're talking about money host an axis. The baby boomers or nineteen point prop 1962. And it came in right in the world war two and all the servicemen. We're coming back in World War II an assortment pampered at a certain. Missed or why is the couple dynamics occurring first I don't know they were tarring. There there. They are living longer. And you have a lot of interesting issues that are associated with. Maybe I'm living. It just means assisted living and longer and then you got issues regarding. Managing. Baby boomers when they start experience in age related injure. Illnesses that his. The man Charles timers. And how to deal with that from a legal point. And so in and also to. There's a lot of litigation. Regarding and you know unfortunately. Lawyers can be proactive as you now with wills I think you'd be very good with wheels because that's like a puzzle. It. Does because what they do is. Is summarizes these mine needs. How rely address those in my state. For example if someone says for all children. One adult children is very responsible. It's. News you know experienced some problem you know fourth child. He's got some real chemical dependency problems but I want and be taking care but I don't want to do away. That for the sector did dependency problem. And trying to beat it only gets you to outline Friday a lot of too much freedom ticking and responsibilities. And so how do you how do you address that. Does issues. And get it down and writing. And if people overseas you know trustees oversee drugs or whatever you need in RT accomplishes objectives. And but on the other hand as well be proactive in and we always deal with the disputes as I think they say that. They say ministers see people at their best. Doctors Ian sees them as they are in the hours the American horse. A lot of people that's in the worst on their lives especially when it on through. Tragedy. All our dream injury. That are -- wars and he even for even. Like war in this state where you have tragedy someone dying or loss. And then you hit the children and fighting. That's like a double whammy. And you a lot of will mining is in this is something it probably gonna impact when east you'd you'd generation practices. There's actually more cases. Of elderly abuse and financial exportation is oddities that that there's. Some that's the owners actually. Use. And it. And that. A lot of you know issues you might have a child to him to call time and why parent gets up and age all in pounced on him and dimension and Allison which appear to let me take care you mom and dad. And in the house than they get into the pocketbook and checkbook and yet things those type situations that we city. It's not the normal situations. No will we see via normal situation. Was so all right let's go let's go to break that sincerity case since there helping legal will win right back after this brief time out they were factored sincerity with Katie since area. First year law student. You can also. Call so law firm Nikko instance area Bible 48371304.

In a little bit more. Accredited credit market acted you know may be taken a couple of officer uses oh she went on a road ever. It's Alabama and nice retirement job for you. All right let's go to tax. She is too. How many times. How many types of power attorneys exist. My mom is 86 with the recent diagnosis of dementia are caddie Steve and now a mansion this upon returning them okay how long does that last. I mean until. In Toledo until you die until it's revoked rates. There you go so the Erica he got a it on and on that. On you attack Damien eight plus it's Tallulah does polity do they apply it I guess it plus they do at the mine is scale. The minds of LA plus name on the legacy it's a C plus which filled a special. All right to OK eight day. Day is planned a KE you know he's done any power over attorneys I mean with type par returns they have also I don't actually take. Take succession and estate. And non cut and so are an employee actually is several type degrees apart return you can have power over tourney just for financial. You give proper attorneys for our health care or you can have a power overturning. It basically. Entailing giving someone authority to do all your day to day activities so you can limited. Or extend to the full extent that you want now the issue about dementia he she like medical stuff you're saying that. One a heart parts but dementia is. There's no extra day is no objective way determine if someone has dementia you have to do it based on subject of occupation and our own thing. And by Toms now dean can be taken about capacity having capacity to entrant to or will or improper turn yet. I mean we've gone through like the you can saying in you know we strive classes meaning similar similar and you consent dress all the things that come into play for. Contract on I think as far as that's concern apology and more of our state if such as custody in the fall prize of uncover them because in which you have to have is minority XEQ like who will or proper turning you have to have the cognitive capacity to understand. The consequences. Year. Actions or understand the terms and conditions in some cases where we had a client who we weren't quite sir sometimes it release it and I was there in an outstanding. It is sometimes it came back and they can tell you they're Social Security elder during kids' names that sometimes they get out again and it mean if I was Christmas they'll. You know we've deathly than their situations are headed. Price determined that in a call that this two things they called loose in bills but the doctors call it pockets of recall another words they're out of it. And then day in it. And they understand what they're doing and then go back now. Now one question one thing to find out succession is just because if there if there in it. And ahead cognitive capacity to make the decision but it's a bad decision. It's still legally enforceable and so that the differences. In who is easily our decision it's an informed decision and and as to what they're doing even though it may be horrible decision. So that's one is cheeses is does that person have the cognitive capacity dementia. Is very difficult to determine so we'll talk over about this after the break we going to. Case CBS news update that go to local local news with Don names and will be back on his resurrection day April last half an hour haltingly so we'll see in a couple of minutes they were back Texan Terry case and Terry all things legal because also offer probable port 371304. And we're talking about arbor attorneys with ally great turns to. Listen to listen. He brought up a point about. Power of attorney can be done to do is something for specific purpose. Like a real estate transaction or. You know someone's out of town on available that you want someone to stand in or you can do. Limitations for turning to an easy maybe some did just directs her new year. The finances there you can you can limited. To whatever you wanted to be launching next expressed terms and it's inching dementia. Talk about dimension to. That's that's one of the things that your generation of turned that deal with because of the baby boomers who going to be living longer. Is trying to figure out someone has the cognitive capacity. To have made that particular decision. Team I have a situation where mom and he were merit at sixty years to five years. One of them you know. Mom dies and it up in age. And remarriage to someone. Whose. Allies younger. And then he decides to give his entire parents season. Do you live during a time period that season questionable health. Those and Connie issues. That it probably happened more more. You know as fourteen mitigate this concern and in Blended Families are getting more more what it says edit the lines are kind of as far as new. And inherited and that takes a special skills to this to figure out how to accomplish all the objectives and I'll also all the emotional objectives also. Let's go to Paul Moscow Charlotte's got a core I guess comment about the show hey Cheryl Jamaal Tinsley with the ex intern case in serie. Yes. I don't know. And joy into your program. And the polls and think. Not much disappointed because at least it. But maybe it is not generation that does listen to is I've been to college full. But on the amount of there and didn't make a profit and I'm Julie program from eight to ten. And almond joy it was indicating it's. It's very informative very formative. And just one question in India and it was everything to Colin for. Now that's that's that's very sweet Caroline wish a happy resurrection day. That's very very very kind comment I make my coffee and listen entail the united. Well all the reasons we we kid about that is because. And just not so much shows specific but it's generational license does that it is foreign maligning used to not listen. Took a lottery ago I mean that's one of the challenges ivory is gonna have and future is. Is connecting with them but. They're probably not at the time in their lives they're really in need a lot of legal. Assistant if it did it in and that's why we kind of with him the kind of green the meals because like when we like especially. You are younger kids the younger siblings. Went out tomorrow in Allen L. You know bill meant to comment Tennessee's show and it indicates just relies narrow. You know people my age now and about you young and hip you know tell me that sir but billion another round. Policies. I guess another aspect. You know. Millennial is that you have a com. Pages. You have a different. Habit I guess his habits as forest a lot of on radio. It is. We'll seek when he seek information they don't on that front think radio unity day. You know it probably I and then it's it's probably will frown upon that promise in the miss that he receive their news is a steep probably piston links on FaceBook. And they're like oh what's going on and they complained and that's kind of how most people stay informed on. You know maybe not my generation perceive that made a couple of years younger than me where they're used to have analysts are in technology no mean an I may. For sharing and she's always on the things that and that's how she finds out about things and if I say the minutes and economical political issue Shillue like solo thinks that you know sent a Tutsi and out. Yeah let's go to phone launch we got a tax question now this is one. Will Woolsey Bach and Handel I don't know what good tax question with AJ AJ you and I'll think glee with Texans are encased in serie. Yet. How candy day. Go back and take taxes out. It. That.

Wish and everyone out there a happy Easter happy resurrection day this is the this is the big holiday for us. Christians and Nazi judges have a blessed day at blustery with a balance. As we are celebrate with their parameters from memoir now we've which they're really represents. And god you know discount bus everybody. We talk a little bit about Robert turning and succession plan. One of the unique problems regarding. That's going to occur with the baby boomers coming ages. Whether. Certain type transactions said that maybe someone who's older and is not flee Capel understanding. What they're doing is. I did they have the full cognitive capacity. Two and turn into certain type transactions and what is things who we do and his lawyers which are different. Is. Which you know if we're in a situation. Where someone is. Any questionable. Like and a sort of declining health and they want to enter into a trap a legal transaction. Involving the will. Or disposition of property. And you you understand that this decisions on hale. Legal consequences. Where some family members are not going to be happy. Tom says something we use and Katie is is technology. And is is. If for example if you excellent elderly. Who in doubt. We're sword and he is. Will that normally will do is will meet with the person. And talk with them and we'll sorry ask them questions. Now asking who the president. Presidents and they say Herbert Hoover . Would probably so maybe this isn't such a good idea. But you know what I think we're doing now is how I question now. And then now I ask why they're here. You know with today want to accomplish. And this is how proposed accomplishment and then ethic and I meet with you in a few days and we'll discuss it again. And then we do it the second time. A lot of times we'll I'll film on palm with our Smartphones which. You can't you could've done with Diallo right now because you've had been a dollop millennial. But and then so that when that becomes an issue. He that you can. Have a record now here's one thing now monologue Quincy here's what is one new technique people would do to make sure that someone. Signed to legal document that's going to maybe change course and you understand it's gonna. Maybe some of the family members may not be happy will would. Among thrown out he who be another good idea to. Team to like be able to have some independent evidence to verify that that person was in the right state of mind to sign this document. Cyclist how that we filmed you know a lot of video depositions. Kind of same. On the same lines when he can you can video Denon. Circumstance I knew we do sometimes we consult a physician. There you go a expert. Well a plus plus he guy is Leo I was I was I was a squid on that the if you if you come out of that memorial is listening to agreement. Yeah. If I was gonna ask you you for your professor was. I don't have any no we not do and that we got the only it's only fair to me off there. But. If bomb would not ask that you get a pause because which you do it is I think one technique used in the Benson. The stage they knew when this event that's on Sundays documents. It would be follow from and in each well and what he did was they signed the document on the same day once thought doctor. And it. Competence in the right. And so you can't sometimes price if you have a doctors and the I want to doctor that morning and now Carolina want to attorney's office and responding news news at cog in the past we understand. That is great evidence. To show. That you use you. The capacity to do that. That was good. I'm out I was I was I was struck out the airport now the answer and you got a little. Praise for her. If they. Well. Yet and I'm back and be worried about your favorite professor it will. Go out there. I. Ollie in Ohio olina one. Report I know I know. And Obama hard. And with our tort that's. Another and that pirate. But that's just me. He says that's not at you now though. Is. So we would OK here's now by this clash would as a toward. They ago. Like the one like the one achievement that liked it to three sentence version with two to the side. In somebody in that warehouse sister is at a at a that. Thanks and of the national strands there he noon a basically it's a pundit is something meant to punish her on compensate the the plaintiff for the person who's been injured and saying guess what you have two different types of claims sometimes you can do to the civil rowdy criminal round because commitment to different things. It's like if you do you sum to someone else and it causes damage. The process where we say in metric. So that he views be heard in if you if you do something. Because you know causes damage in the right competency. Whatever and injure injury is the fact one Alice at LSU faced being charged in Merrill deport department. And they used to have the hit 200 play football teams that it's meta name. And always remembered the name as a couple of names one I don't wanna say because it's Easter morning but. They call them that tort these yours. Which is a person who commits an action against someone else that may be actionable or some type of damage. And so last thought toward these are my. What is that and I ask say I mean would you not asked lemonade and as much law student who are very glad to educate me a lot more than I want to be on when it was but. All right let's go up by a brick that sincerity. A decent burial things legal we write back in his free time they were back necessary case and there are all things legal.

In an effort to convert audiences to customers, brands are beginning to hold mobile-native approaches as a standard requirement in their marketing efforts. As mobile phones remain a extension of the human limb, influencing consumers when they reach a point of consideration is key to driving sales. Mobile approaches ensure that conversions are made, both online and off. 
According to recent Google research, consumers will use their mobiles to seek out advice before making purchases 69% of the time. This advice could be in the form of comments from peers they trust, or online reviews. In 76% of these cases, these consumers will go on to visit a brick and mortar store on the same day, and 28% of these visits will result in a sale. Recommended for You

The path to purchase for a consumer begins when they are made aware of their awareness of a brand’s product or service. This funnels through to consideration, purchasing the product or service, and then converting from a loyal customer into an advocate. Investing a brand’s marketing budget into where their audience spends most of its time (on mobiles) lead to shortening the path to purchase, and leading to quicker conversions 
The challenge for brands is that audiences see through the often sugar-coated brand messages. The best way to growth hack credibility and spark authentic conversation is to engage social influencers and creators to travel a brand’s message to the audience. 
A leading influencer marketing platform, Webfluential, recently shared its top search categories for Q3 2016, highlighting lifestyle, fashion and beauty were the market verticals that brands most sought to influence through trusted peers and digital creators.

Seeing a musical on stage is a special experience. Seeing it at a venue such as the famed Lincoln Center is an even more special experience. Now thanks to Public Media Distribution audiences can enjoy both experiences from the comfort of their own homes with the release of Live from Lincoln Center : Rodgers & Hammerstein’s Carousel .
Live from Lincoln Center : Rodgers & Hammerstein’s Carousel was released Feb 28 on DVD. The performance, originally recorded in the Avery Fisher Hall at the famed arts center in March 2013, features music from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and performances by Kelli O’Hara ( Sex and the City 2 , Peter Pan Live , The Accidental Wolf ), Shuler Hensley ( Van Helsing , The Legend of Zorro , After Life ), John Cullum ( Northern Exposure , The Middle , ER ) and others.
The 2013 performance presented in PBS’ new release is not the first time that the musical has been staged at the Lincoln Theater. It has also been presented at the famed facility in 1994 and won five Tony ® Awards for that run including Best Musical Revival and Best Featured Actress in a Musical for Audra McDonald.
Rodgers & Hammerstein’s musical, based on Hungarian playwright Ferenc Molnar’s 1909 play Liliom , has been called “the best musical of the 20 th Century” by Time magazine. It moves Molnar’s original story from Europe to the Maine coastline as it follows the tragic love story of carnival barker Billy Bigelow and mill worker Julie Jordan. The story includes such memorable songs as ‘If I Loved You,’ ‘June Is Bustin’ Out All Over’ and ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone.’
Ever since it made its Broadway debut in 1945, Carousel has been adapted countless times across America and the world. It has even been translated into a big-screen feature that debuted in American theaters on Feb. 16, 1956. It is currently in Paris by Britain’s Opera North.

(AP) — The man who randomly gunned down a Cleveland retiree and posted video of the crime on Facebook killed himself Tuesday during a police chase in Pennsylvania that began when a McDonald’s drive-thru attendant recognized him.
It marked a violent end to the nearly 48-hour multistate manhunt for Steve Stephens, whose case brought another round of criticism down on Facebook over how responsibly it polices objectionable material posted by users.
Acting on a tip from the McDonald’s, state troopers spotted Stephens leaving the restaurant in Erie and went after him, bumping his car to try to get it to stop, authorities said. He shot himself in the head after the car spun and came to a stop, police said.
“This started with one tragedy and ended with another person taking their own life,” said Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams. “We would have liked to have brought Steve in peacefully and really talked to him about why this happened.”
Stephens, a 37-year-old job counselor who worked with young people, was wanted on murder charges in the killing of Robert Godwin Sr., 74, a former foundry worker and father of 10 who was picking up aluminum cans on Sunday when he was shot.
The chilling video was on Facebook for three hours before it was taken down. It was just the latest instance of crime footage being shared on social media.
At a Silicon Valley conference Tuesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg briefly addressed the Cleveland case, saying Facebook has “a lot of work to do” and “we will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this.”
Police would not speculate on what triggered the killing, but in the video and other footage he posted, Stephens talked about having trouble with his girlfriend and losing everything he had to gambling. He said he “just snapped.”
One of Godwin’s daughters, Debbie Godwin, said she wished Stephens had been captured.
“I’m not happy he’s dead at all, not at all. If you did it, you have to face your crime,” she said.
The break in the case came when police received a tip that Stephens was at the McDonald’s in Erie, in far western Pennsylvania about 100 miles east of Cleveland, where he ordered a 20-piece Chicken McNuggets and fries.
The drive-thru attendant thought she recognized Stephens and called state police, restaurant owner Thomas DuCharme Jr. told the Erie Times-News. State Police Maj. William Teper Jr. would say only that the tip came from a “concerned citizen.”
The McDonald’s employees tried to “buy some time for the cops” by telling Stephens his fries were delayed, but he said he had no time to wait and drove off, according to DuCharme.
Police picked up the trail in a chase that lasted 2 miles before Stephens took his own life, authorities said.
Gail Wheeler, of Erie, said she was stopped at a light at the McDonald’s when Stephens came “whipping out” of the parking lot, nearly hitting her. She said state troopers weren’t far behind.
Wheeler said she followed the chase and saw a trooper clip Stephens’ rear bumper. His car did a half-turn and came to rest against the curb, and she heard a gunshot, she said. She then saw officers approach the car.
The officer closest to the car “just shook his head,” she said. “They had their guns out, but when he shook his head, they lowered their guns.”
Police said it wasn’t clear whether Stephens had any help while he was on the run or where he had been and that investigators will try to retrace his steps. Stephens’ cellphone had been tracked Sunday afternoon near Erie, officials said on Monday.
Facebook said it removed the video of the shooting 23 minutes after learning of it. The company has since announced it is launching a review for reporting harmful content.
“This is something that should not have been shared around the world. Period,” Cleveland’s police chief said.
In the video, Stephens told Godwin the name of his girlfriend and said, “She’s the reason that this is about to happen to you.” Godwin did not seem to recognize the name.
The woman, Joy Lane, told WJW-TV in Cleveland that she last talked with Stephens on Saturday night, when he told her he had quit his job and was moving out of state.
Investigators said that Godwin was the only victim so far linked to Stephens, despite his claim on Facebook that he killed over a dozen people.
Detectives spoke with the suspect on Sunday by cellphone and tried to persuade him to surrender, police said. Within a day, authorities expanded the search nationwide and offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to his capture.

The change comes after a passenger, Dr. David Dao, was dragged from a fully-booked United Express flight in Chicago because he refused to give up his seat to make room for crew members. Cellphone video of the incident sparked widespread outrage and created a public-relations nightmare for United.
Under the change outlined in an internal April 14 email, a crew member must make must-ride bookings at least 60 minutes prior to departure. Crews could previously be booked until the time of departure.

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Joe Johnson has seen a lot in his 16 years in the NBA. So the veteran didn't flinch with the clock ticking down and the game tied. 
All that experience is why the Utah Jazz brought him in this season. 
It paid off when Johnson drove the lane and hit a floater at the buzzer, giving the Jazz a 97-95 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers after Utah lost Rudy Gobert 17 seconds into their playoff opener on Saturday night. 
""I just wanted to get as close as I could to the basket, and it was a good thing it went down,"" Johnson said. 
Johnson, who scored 21 points, was left isolated against Jamal Crawford on the final play. He powered his way inside and lofted a shot over Crawford and DeAndre Jordan that bounced around the rim before falling in. A video review confirmed it was good. 
""I just try to be patient, get to a sweet spot, and make the right play,"" Johnson said. 
He's made an NBA-best eight game-winning buzzer-beaters in the past 10 years. 
""That's what he's been doing all his career,"" Utah's Boris Diaw said. ""So when he gets the ball at the end of the game, we are pretty confident."" 
The Jazz were dealt a blow before either team had settled into the game. 
Gobert sprained his left knee on the game's first play when he banged knees with Clippers forward Luc Mbah a Moute, leaving the Jazz without their 7-foot-1 center who averaged 14.0 points and 12.8 rebounds during the regular season. 
""We felt and knew that a lot of people probably were counting us out when he went down, but man, we stuck together,"" Johnson said. 
Utah steadied itself behind Johnson and fellow veteran George Hill, both of whom were brought in to balance the inexperienced Jazz. Johnson finished with 21 points off the bench and Hill added 16 points. 
Gordon Hayward had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Utah. 
Blake Griffin scored 26 points and Chris Paul added 25 points and 11 assists for the Clippers, whose seven-game winning streak ended with their first loss since March 26 against Sacramento. 
A driving Paul banked in a floater with 13 seconds to go, tying the game at 95. 
The Jazz didn't call a timeout. 
""We just wanted to have it where they couldn't set up on us,"" Hayward said, glancing at Johnson. ""We just wanted to get it and go and let this man go to work."" 
Making their first playoff appearance in five years, the Jazz outshot the Clippers and narrowly controlled the paint, owning a 42-40 edge. 
The teams tied with identical 51-31 records in the regular season. The Clippers earned the No. 4 seed and home court by virtue of winning the season series 3-1. 
""We fought until the end of the year to get it, and now we've given it right back,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. 
Utah withstood Paul's offensive outburst in the fourth after the Jazz led by eight on Hill's 3-pointer. Paul rattled off 10 straight Los Angeles points, drawing the Clippers to 90-89 on a 3-pointer. 
Hayward and Johnson scored, keeping the Jazz ahead 94-91. But Johnson lost the ball and Hill fouled Griffin, who made both free throws to get the Clippers to 94-93 with 23 seconds left. 
After a timeout by the Jazz, Griffin fouled Derrick Favors, who missed the first and made the second after it hit the rim and went in for a 95-93 lead with 18 seconds left. 
""We've got to be better,"" Paul said. ""They played harder, they were more physical."" 
Gobert was setting a screen when he and Mbah a Moute made contact and Gobert fell to the court clutching his left leg. 
He had to be helped off by Diaw and Hill. A team spokesman said X-rays were negative, and Gobert was taken from Staples Center to have a precautionary MRI. 
""We felt a little bit stunned out there,"" Diaw said, ""but then we regrouped and got back on the horse."" 
The matchup between Gobert and Jordan was expected to be a key in the best-of-7 series. Jordan finished with 10 points and 15 rebounds and got called for a technical in the fourth with the Clippers down six. 
""We have the rule, no fourth-quarter techs, and he got one,"" Rivers said. ""It didn't make a huge difference, but it could have for sure."" 
Utah outscored the Clippers 16-10 to open the third before Crawford's jumper put Los Angeles ahead 70-68. Hayward singlehandedly outscored the Clippers 6-0 to send the Jazz into the fourth leading 74-70. 
Neither team led by more than six points in the first half. The Clippers were ahead by six when the Jazz outscored them 14-2 in the second quarter to take their own six-point lead. Griffin got stripped under the basket by Hayward, but he hit a 3-pointer and made a layup on the Clippers' next two possessions to key a 14-8 spurt that ended with the half tied 52-all. 
TIP-INS 
Jazz: The last time the teams met in the playoffs was a first-round series in 1996-97, won 3-0 by the Jazz. ... Utah also won the teams' other postseason series 3-2 in 1991-92, which was interrupted by the riots after the Rodney King verdict. 
Clippers: Backup G Austin Rivers (strained left hamstring) did some shooting for the first time Saturday since his injury. He's out for at least the first two games of the series. ... Former Clipper Baron Davis shared hugs with the referees from the courtside seat. 
UP NEXT 
Game 2 is Tuesday night at Staples Center.

0,Charlemagne,2017-04-16T23:51:51.000+03:00,[],,,english,74,2017-04-16T22:51:00.000+03:00,,"Some estimates are that the societal cost of the ""drug problem"" adds up to about $600 billion annually - that's the cost of enforcement, treatment, lost taxes/productivity, etc. It's a very large number, and bigger than the revenues of Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft combined. On a per-capita basis, illegal drugs cost the average American about $2,000 every year.
The Federal government will spend over $31 billion on drug abuse programs in 2017, about 7% of the discretionary Federal budget alone. The States add another $28 billion at the local level. There's also an unknown amount of private money spent - insurance companies that pay for treatment and so forth. Point is, the US is spending roughly $60 billion on drug abuse, and getting very little return from that investment.
At different times over the last several decades, we've focused spending increases on enforcement, education and treatment. The sad reality is that there's no particular correlation between spending on any particular type of program and reducing the size of the drug problem. If you track that $600 billion number back to 1970, it's inched up at about the same rate no matter what we've done.
Collectively, if the illegal drug industry were combined into a single company, it would be the largest corporation in America, some 25% larger than Walmart. Naturally, like any big operation, it knows how to attract customers, recruit salespeople, protect its supply lines and so on. And against this, we send in the usual government bureaucrat. Let's admit the obvious: the illegal drug industry is winning.
I have no particular answer other than to suggest that it's time for a clean-sheet review of the whole situation. Many of today's programs exist so that self-serving politicians can spread the wealth to their cronies and can brag about being tough on drugs.
Liberals will go for the heartstrings, talking about compassion and wanting to spend more on treatment or education. Conservatives will talk about law and order, spending more on interdiction, prisons and the legal system. Problem is, like LBJ's Great Society programs, these things might feel good, but very little actually happens. We've been hearing basically the same stories since the 1960's, and it hasn't gotten us anywhere.
I, for one, am tired of one ineffective government program after the next, and the drug war is a prime example of wasting tons of the taxpayer's hard-earned dollars while achieving very little of value. It's 2017, and as we inch towards 20 trillion in national debt, it's time to rethink some of these absurd programs...either come up with something that works, or shut it down, legalize what makes sense and admit defeat.",,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSAQZoG.Zl5.6vemZe6HmN21mjlckC.N2ernW_Hl4eJ1NO5lwPVj.WRO6QNn1enuC5c2FD3rZR5GXkCVDNxRn1Nk5urm77JHgf1D8gV8Sv0aW0asceGWgLOqITEkNuDxgLDGZaQbt3cUYa3BLXLncg3MdWDfz26Vy4-,43aa45ee375a6b0ef28f30d3259cfb2a7cc560f6,pjmedia.com,https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/news-and-politics/user-content/50/files/2017/04/AP_17082569506116.sized-770x415xt.jpg,https://pjmedia.com/,PJ Media,US,5056.0,0,pjmedia.com,28,Clinton: ’80s Drug ‘Sentencing Craze’ was ‘Way Overdone’,0.002,blogs,78,[],[],[]

Unlike sugar, it doesn’t create an insulin response and actually nourishes the pancreas, which helps regulate blood sugar. The leaf is 30 times sweeter than sugar, while extracts are 300-400 times sweeter. This is good for the  sugar addict  as it will give sweetness without all the negative effects of sugar. 5 SWEET BENEFITS OF STEVIA Excellent for Diabetics Type 2 diabetic patients who took 1 gram of stevioside (present in the plant Stevia) with a meal had an 18 percent reduction in blood sugar according to this  study . A  study  that compared Stevia, regular  sugar  and  aspartame , showed that Stevia lowered blood sugar and insulin levels after a meal. Note:   Artificial sweeteners  often raise your blood sugar levels even more than sugar. Reduces Risk of Pancreatic Cancer Stevia has sterols and antioxidant compounds (kaempferol, quercetin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, isoquercitrin and isosteviol) in it and studies have found that kaempferol can reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer by  23 percent . Helps Lower Bad Cholesterol and Increase Good Cholesterol A  study  in 2009 found stevia helps lower bad cholesterol and increase good cholesterol. Research also noted that the subjects had no adverse side effects from the Stevia on their health. Breast Cancer Reduced This 2012  study  found that stevioside helped to decrease specific stress pathways that create breast cancer growth. Great for Weight Loss Stevia has no calories or carbohydrates.  Consuming added sugars has been shown to contribute an average of  16 percent  of the total calories in the American diet. This high sugar intake has been linked to weight gain and adverse effects on blood sugar.  3 Extra Benefits: Fights Cavities:  The ‘sweet herb’ is antibacterial, and unlike sugar, it does not feed oral bacteria and is recommended by the  National Center for Biotechnology Information  to be helpful in preventing cavities. Stevia extracts were linked to  less acidic plaque , which is good for cavity prevention. Skin Care:  The antibacterial properties help with acne. I have experienced a pimple disappearing soon after using stevia on it. Fights Yeast Infections: Stevia does not feed candida or other yeast and is slightly antibacterial and anti-fungal. Can One Be Allergic to Stevia? The European Food Safety Committee after reviewing the S tevia literature  stated that there was no cause for concern for allergic reactions to the Stevia plant. Also, the  FDA  declared that stevia was safe in foods and beverages.  Stevia Caution Some Stevia extracts are so isolated that they have a bitter taste and so other artificial sweeteners have to be added. Some commercial Stevias have been extracted solely with alcohol solvents (usually the white powder form). This alcohol solvent leaves the sweet taste of the Stevia but can take away some of the health benefits. Highly processed “Stevia,” such as Truvia, is not real Stevia by the time it goes through refining. Chemical solvents are added during the refining process which includes  acetonitrile , found to be toxic to the liver and a carcinogen.

Synopsis: Middle-aged brothers Jason and Tom Prendergast thought they were completely done with each other. Perceived betrayal had burned the bridge between them, tossing them into the icy river of estrangement. But life – and death – has a robust sense of irony, and when they learn that their cruel father has died and made his final request that they travel together across the country to spread his ashes, they have no choice but to spend a long, long car trip in each other's company. It's either that or lose out on the contents of the envelope he's left with his lawyer. The trip will be as gut-wrenching as each expects it to be . . . and revealing in ways neither of them is prepared for. 

At turns humorous, biting, poignant, and surprisingly tender, Ashes puts a new spin on family and dysfunction with a story that is at once fresh and timelessly universal. 

Read an excerpt: 
Tom wheeled his late-model, platinum-colored BMW into Attorney Russell Norman’s freshly paved lot and parked between a brand new Lexus—sporting the license plate JUSTIS4U—and a custom pickup truck. Looks like I’m going after the hillbilly, he thought when he spotted the faded Massachusetts Department of Correction sticker in the rear window. His blood turned cold. “It must be Jason,” he thought aloud. I didn’t think he’d come.

Tom took a few deep breaths, not because he was nervous about his father’s death or talking to any lawyer but because he hadn’t seen his Neanderthal brother—for fifteen years, I think. He paused for a moment to give it more thought. Although their relationship had essentially vaporized in their late teens—the result of a fall out that still haunted his dreams—they’d occasionally wound up in each other’s orbits; weddings, funerals, and the like, enough to remain familiar with each other’s career choices, wives, and children. But even that came to an end fifteen years ago, he confirmed in his aching head before opening the door. While his toothache-induced migraine threatened to blind him, he took one step into the oak-paneled waiting room. His and Jason’s eyes met for the briefest moment. As though they were complete strangers, they both looked away. And here he is, Tom thought, disappointed. This is just great.

Through peripheral vision, Tom noticed that his older brother now wore a scar over his right eye, just above a bushy eyebrow that could have easily belonged to a homeless Scotsman. A jagged ear lobe, a piece clearly torn away, pointed to a crooked nose that sat sideways on his face—all of it rearranged since birth. What a big tub of shit he’s turned into, Tom thought, struggling to ignore his throbbing face and head. He’s as fat as a wood tick now, he thought, grinning, and he looks like he’s ready to pop. Jason looked straight at him, as if reading his mind. Tom immediately looked away, his rapid heartbeat starting to pound in his ears, intensifying his physical pain. Unbelievable, he thought. After all the years and all the distance, his elder brother—by only two years—still scared the hell out of him. He’s just a big asshole, that’s all, he told himself, but he still couldn’t bring himself to rejoin his brother’s penetrating gaze.

The secretary answered her phone before calling out, “Mr. Prendergast . . .”

Both brothers stood.

“Attorney Norman will see you now.”

Tom walked in first, letting the door close behind him—right in Jason’s face.

“Still a weasel,” Jason muttered, loud enough for all to hear.

“What was that?” Tom asked just inside the door.

“Don’t even think about playing with me,” Jason warned as he reopened the door and entered the room, “’cause I have no problem throwing you over my knee and spanking you right in front of this guy.”

I’m fifty years old, for God’s sake, Tom thought, and he thinks he’s going to spank me? I’m surprised the prison even let him out.

The attorney—his hand extended for anyone willing to give it a shake—looked mortified by the childish exchange.

Tom shook the man’s hand before settling into a soft leather wing chair. Jason followed suit.

The room was framed in rich mahogany paneling. The desk could have belonged in the oval office. Beneath a green-glassed banker’s lamp, stacks of file folders took up most of the vast desktop. An American flag stood in one corner, while framed diplomas and certificates, bearing witness to the man’s intelligence and vast education, covered the brown walls.

Attorney Norman wore a pinstriped shirt and pleated, charcoal-colored slacks held up by a pair of black suspenders. He had a bow tie, a receding hairline that begged to be shaved bald, and a pair of eyeglasses that John Lennon would have been proud to call his own. There’s no denying it, Tom thought, trying to ignore his brother’s wheezing beside him, he’s either a lawyer or a banker. He couldn’t be anything else.

While Jason squirmed in his seat, visibly uncomfortable to be sitting in a lawyer’s office, his hands squeezed the arms of the chair. What a chicken shit, Tom thought, trying to make himself feel better. Peering sideways, he noticed that his brother’s knuckles were so swollen with scar tissue they could have belonged to a man who made his living as a bare-knuckle brawler. He’s still an animal too, he decided.

Attorney Norman took a seat, grabbed a manila file from atop the deep stack and cleared his throat. “The reason you’re both here . . .”

“. . . is to make sure the old man’s really dead,” Jason interrupted.

In spite of himself and his harsh feelings for his brother, Tom chuckled—drawing looks from both men.

“The reason we’re all here,” Attorney Norman repeated, “is to read Stuart Prendergast’s last will and testament.” He flipped open the folder.

This ought to be good, Tom thought, while Jason took a deep breath and sighed heavily. Both brothers sat erect in their plush chairs, waiting to hear more.

As if he were Stuart Prendergast sitting there in the flesh, the mouthpiece read, “My final wish is that my two sons, Jason and Thomas, bring my final remains to 1165 Milford Road in Seattle, Washington, where they will spread my ashes.”

“Seattle?” Tom blurted, his wagging tongue catching his tooth, making him wince in pain. Quickly concealing his weakness, he slid to the edge of his seat. “Oh, I don’t think so,” he mumbled, careful not to touch the tooth again.

Jason was shaking his head. “Hell no,” he said.

The attorney read on. “I’ve always been afraid to fly, so I’m asking that I not be transported by airplane but driven by car.”

“No way,” Tom instinctively sputtered.

Jason laughed aloud. “This is just great. The old bastard’s dead and he’s still screwing with us.”

The less-than-amused attorney revealed a sealed envelope and continued on. “As my final gift to my sons . . .”

“Only gift,” Tom muttered, feeling a cauldron of bad feelings bubbling in his gut.

“I’m leaving this sealed envelope for them to share, once and only once they’ve taken me to my final resting place.”

“What the fuck!” Jason blurted.

Every cell in Tom’s overloaded brain flashed red. Don’t do it, he thought. You don’t owe that old man a damned thing. But every cell in his body was flooded with curiosity. He looked at Jason, who was no longer shaking his fat head.

“Maybe the bastard finally hit it big at the dog track?” Jason suggested.

Tom nodded in agreement but secretly wondered, Could it be the deed to the land Pop bragged about owning in Maine? He stared at the envelope. For as long as I can remember, he claimed to own forty-plus acres with a brook running straight through it. He stared harder. Could it be? he wondered, wishing he had X-ray vision. A parcel of land in Maine sure would make a nice retirement . . .

“How ’bout we travel separately and meet in Seattle to spread the ashes?” Jason said, interrupting his thoughts.

“Great idea,” Tom said, hoping against all hope that the idea would fly with their father’s lawyer.

Attorney Norman shook his head. “I’m sorry, gentlemen, but your father specifically requested that you travel together with his remains to Seattle. Any deviation from this can and will prohibit you from attaining the sealed envelope.”

There was a long pause, the room blanketed in a heavy silence. Son of a bitch, Tom thought, this couldn’t have come at a worse time. He turned to Jason, who was already looking at him. “What do you say?” he asked, already cursing his inability to curb his curiosity.

Jason shook his head in disgust. “The last thing I want to do is to go on some stupid road trip with you.”

“Trust me, that’s a mutual feeling,” Tom shot back.

“But I don’t think we have a choice,” Jason added. “Our fucked-up father wants to play one last game with us, so to hell with it—let’s play.”

This is insane, but he’s right, Tom thought. With a single nod, Tom stood. “Okay, let’s have the ashes then,” he told the lawyer.

The attorney shook his head. “I don’t have them. They’re currently at a funeral home in Salem.”

“Salem?” Tom squeaked, unhappy that his tone betrayed his distress.

“That’s right. You have to take custody of your father’s remains from the Buffington Funeral Home in Salem, Massachusetts.”

“You must be shitting me.” Jason said.

The attorney smirked. “I shit you not,” he said, throwing the letter onto his desk.

Salem? Tom repeated in his head. Just when I thought Pop couldn’t be a bigger prick . . . The migraine knocked even harder from the inside of his skull, making him feel nauseous. Amid the pain, his synapses fired wildly, considering all this would mean: I’ll have to take bereavement leave from school and find someone to cover my classes. I should probably double my treatment with Dr. Baxter tomorrow. And what about Caleb and Caroline? he asked himself, quickly deciding, They’ll be fine without me for a few days. Then he pictured his wife’s face. And Carmen, she’ll be fine without me for a lot longer than that. The nausea increased. Screw her.

“Are we done here?” Jason asked, obviously itching to leave.

The lawyer nodded. “I’ll need proof in the form of a video or a series of photos that you’ve deposited your father’s remains where he wished. Once I have that, the letter’s all yours.”

“How wonderful,” Jason said sarcastically. He stood, turned on his heels, and headed for the door.

Tom also got to his feet. He looked at the lawyer and, trying to ignore his physical discomfort, he smiled. “Don’t mind him,” he said, shrugging. “That imbecile is exactly what our father trained him to be.” 
My Review 
I’m a huge fan of Steven Manchester’s work, so I jumped at the chance to review his latest book, Ashes. The premise intrigued me even though it’s not a genre I typically read. 

As I started the book, I wasn’t quite sure I would like it or even finish it. I didn’t particularly like the main characters. Each brother seemed to be nasty and not very sympathetic, but as I kept reading, my feelings had a complete turnaround. As I the story continued, I began to truly care about each character and saw what shaped their lives. 

I, also, had a preconceived notion of how this was going to turn out. I was sure it would have a predictable ending, but it didn’t. I was totally taken by surprise in the direction the author went. Readers kept learning new things about Jason and Tom with each chapter.  Each character has their faults but also some good things.  They are flawed people, which makes them real.

I ended up not able to put this heart wrenching, emotional, realistic book down. This is a huge slice of life with characters you can truly care about. Steven Manchester did not let me down with this one.

Under one possible scenario, they would start at the All-Star Game on July 11 in Miami, tweak the process over the season’s second half and then go forward with the experiment in the playoffs. 
People familiar with the talks spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because an agreement has not yet been reached. 
Last year, MLB asked for the plate ump to wear a mic at the All-Star Game, but there wasn’t enough time to do it. 
The umpires are in the middle of their five-year labor deal and any change would involve negotiations, plus a comfort level on both sides that the system would be efficient, accurate and easy. 
So no way to say for sure if fans at Camden Yards, Coors Field and ballparks across the majors will become familiar with the voices of veteran crew chiefs – be it country singer Joe West, ordained minister Ted Barrett or Dale Scott, once a Top 40 AM radio disc jockey. 
”It probably would be nice to get a little more explanation,” Marlins reliever Brad Ziegler said. ”They’re supposed to say the call stands or the call’s confirmed. `The call stands’ means you can’t tell. A lot of times we don’t get that … they just signal out or safe. That’s all we get on the field. 
”They may announce it on the PA, but it doesn’t seem like that is consistent in all parks. And the acoustics in the stadium here – we have a hard time hearing what’s on the PA in the bullpen,” he said. 
In the NFL, hearing refs announce ”upon further review” has long been part of the lexicon. The lore includes what Ben Dreith said in a 1986 game, when Jets lineman Marty Lyons tangled with Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly and was penalized for ”giving him the business down there.” 
The NHL for some time has mic’ed up officials to explain coach’s challenges, based on what the central replay booth tells them. 
NBA crew chiefs put on headsets to watch reviews and talk with the replay center. Decisions are explained to the official scorer’s table and the benches, and the public address announcers inform the crowd. 
MLB has tried to speed up reviews this year, aiming for the umpires in the New York replay booth to relay the final calls to the field in under 2 minutes. 
”It’ll take more time,” Boston pitcher David Price said. ”It’s not going to make them any shorter.” 
As for making the replay system more informative and entertaining, ”Yeah, until they have a problem with the umpire’s mic,” he said. 
Marlins star Christian Yelich said a switch wouldn’t affect him. 
”The call’s the call,”he said. ”Just because they tell you what they decided isn’t going to change it.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Joe Johnson has seen a lot in his 16 years in the NBA. So the veteran didn't flinch with the clock ticking down and the game tied. 
All that experience is why the Utah Jazz brought him in this season. 
It paid off when Johnson drove the lane and hit a floater at the buzzer, giving the Jazz a 97-95 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers after Utah lost Rudy Gobert 17 seconds into their playoff opener on Saturday night. 
""I just wanted to get as close as I could to the basket, and it was a good thing it went down,"" Johnson said. 
Johnson, who scored 21 points, was left isolated against Jamal Crawford on the final play. He powered his way inside and lofted a shot over Crawford and DeAndre Jordan that bounced around the rim before falling in. A video review confirmed it was good. 
""I just try to be patient, get to a sweet spot, and make the right play,"" Johnson said. 
He's made an NBA-best eight game-winning buzzer-beaters in the past 10 years. 
""That's what he's been doing all his career,"" Utah's Boris Diaw said. ""So when he gets the ball at the end of the game, we are pretty confident."" 
The Jazz were dealt a blow before either team had settled into the game. 
Gobert sprained his left knee on the game's first play when he banged knees with Clippers forward Luc Mbah a Moute, leaving the Jazz without their 7-foot-1 center who averaged 14.0 points and 12.8 rebounds during the regular season. 
""We felt and knew that a lot of people probably were counting us out when he went down, but man, we stuck together,"" Johnson said. 
Utah steadied itself behind Johnson and fellow veteran George Hill, both of whom were brought in to balance the inexperienced Jazz. Johnson finished with 21 points off the bench and Hill added 16 points. 
Gordon Hayward had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Utah. 
Blake Griffin scored 26 points and Chris Paul added 25 points and 11 assists for the Clippers, whose seven-game winning streak ended with their first loss since March 26 against Sacramento. 
A driving Paul banked in a floater with 13 seconds to go, tying the game at 95. 
The Jazz didn't call a timeout. 
""We just wanted to have it where they couldn't set up on us,"" Hayward said, glancing at Johnson. ""We just wanted to get it and go and let this man go to work."" 
Making their first playoff appearance in five years, the Jazz outshot the Clippers and narrowly controlled the paint, owning a 42-40 edge. 
The teams tied with identical 51-31 records in the regular season. The Clippers earned the No. 4 seed and home court by virtue of winning the season series 3-1. 
""We fought until the end of the year to get it, and now we've given it right back,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. 
Utah withstood Paul's offensive outburst in the fourth after the Jazz led by eight on Hill's 3-pointer. Paul rattled off 10 straight Los Angeles points, drawing the Clippers to 90-89 on a three-pointer. 
Hayward and Johnson scored, keeping the Jazz ahead 94-91. But Johnson lost the ball and Hill fouled Griffin, who made both free throws to get the Clippers to 94-93 with 23 seconds left. 
After a timeout by the Jazz, Griffin fouled Derrick Favors, who missed the first and made the second after it hit the rim and went in for a 95-93 lead with 18 seconds left. 
""We've got to be better,"" Paul said. ""They played harder, they were more physical."" 
Gobert was setting a screen when he and Mbah a Moute made contact and Gobert fell to the court clutching his left leg. 
He had to be helped off by Diaw and Hill. A team spokesman said X-rays were negative, and Gobert was taken from Staples Center to have a precautionary MRI. 
""We felt a little bit stunned out there,"" Diaw said, ""but then we regrouped and got back on the horse."" 
The matchup between Gobert and Jordan was expected to be a key in the best-of-7 series. Jordan finished with 10 points and 15 rebounds and got called for a technical in the fourth with the Clippers down six. 
""We have the rule, no fourth-quarter techs, and he got one,"" Rivers said. ""It didn't make a huge difference, but it could have for sure."" 
Utah outscored the Clippers 16-10 to open the third before Crawford's jumper put Los Angeles ahead 70-68. Hayward singlehandedly outscored the Clippers 6-0 to send the Jazz into the fourth leading 74-70. 
Neither team led by more than six points in the first half. The Clippers were ahead by six when the Jazz outscored them 14-2 in the second quarter to take their own six-point lead. Griffin got stripped under the basket by Hayward, but he hit a 3-pointer and made a layup on the Clippers' next two possessions to key a 14-8 spurt that ended with the half tied 52-all.

Afriend writes, “For basically the past six months or so I’ve been trying to tell my lefty friends in so many words, ‘Hey, there are a bunch of people on the Internet who are waiting for someone to tell them it’s okay to start shooting at you.’” He became concerned when a thread at the non-political firearms-enthusiasts website he regularly follows became filled with comments in all caps referring to liberals as enemies who must be shot. Developments both online and off following Donald Trump’s election have caused me to share his concern. 
In December, an author at the biggest and most explicitly non-political gun site, the Firearms Blog (its tagline is “Firearms, not politics”), recounted his experience with an outfit that offers tactical training based on the methods of the Israel Defense Forces. The moderator soon had to begin deleting comments. One that remains protested, “as if through the millennia, hundreds of nations, principalities and city-states reached the same conclusions,” and urged the curious to check out Judaism.is/genocide.html where one can watch the film Jewish Ritual Murder Revisited: The Hidden Cult. 
Four days after Donald Trump’s inauguration, a community member on a moderate firearms law site, PAGunBlog, a civil redoubt welcoming “active participation by both firearms enthusiasts and people who hate them,” described his shock from that morning’s web-surf when “a long-time commenter who I recognized as right-leaning but mostly moderate commented that ‘The Jews own and control everything in America…’ Not many months ago no one except a flaming neo-Nazi would have dreamed of expressing such an opinion, but today it seems to have become an acceptable element of our discourse. I noticed that no one replied to or castigated the comment.” 
Then came February 1 in Berkeley and things really started getting scary. 
The saga of what happened when Milo Yiannopoulos came to speak at the flagship campus of the University of California has since become foundational, not just with the alt-right but with quite nearly the entire right. Alt-right provocateur Yiannopoulos was turned back by violent protests, which culminated in the burning of a portable generator. Stuffed down the wingnut memory hole are the events that preceded the mêlée. The violence was, in fact, preceded by peaceful protests by approximately 1,500 Berkeley students, until they were waylaid by a tiny handful of off-campus “Black Bloc” and “antifa,” or anti-fascist, cadres who believe racist speech licenses violent resistance. It was also preceded, less than two weeks earlier, by the shooting of a Milo protester in Seattle, by a gunman who has yet to be charged with any crime. 
The Battle of Berkeley accelerated the construction of a body of mythology: the left has escalated its resistance to Trump into literal war, so Trump supporters must be prepared to resort to violence to oppose it. 
How afraid of this should you be? The most interesting answers to that question do not come from the left. They come from concerned voices on the right, who’ve been monitoring the chatter with mounting alarm, going public with pleas to liberals to still the antifa renegades before bodies begin piling up. The most convincing evidence that they have a point comes in the ensuing comment threads, where the need to prepare for armed force is taken as gospel. 
The proprietor of Being Libertarian, a Facebook community with 438,888 likes, wrote of Berkeley, “This was a riot,” and urged liberals to “BE LOUD” and renounce the rioters: “Conservatives are going to have a field day with this. If you just sit there quietly, you’re essentially letting yourself be associated with campus-pillaging barbarians.” He added, “You should consider yourself lucky nobody shot you.” 
Clearly, this man knows his audience. The comment, “When someone has set your car on fire and is chasing you around with a blunt object, you get to make an executive decision regarding your continued existence,” got 1,403 likes. The conviction that this would be acting in self-defense was affirmed by the man who wrote, “these riots that have been occurring are what got my ass in gear to get the final steps of my pistol permit application completed. My unrestricted carry permit can’t come soon enough.” Someone reminded him a gun license “is not a license to kill.” His response: “Yes I’m aware. I just refuse to end up a helpless victim when crazy shit like this goes down.” 
Oleg Volk is an advertising professional and Second Amendment activist based in Nashville. He wrote on a Facebook wall about the Berkeley events: “Rioting? That’s how you get Freikorps reenacting the demise of the Bavarian Republic with full approval of the majority of the population.” The Freikorps were volunteer paramilitaries set up by German World War I veterans that violently put down Communist uprisings, piling up bodies by the thousands; the movement officially came to a close in 1933 when Freikorps leaders surrendered their battle flags in loyalty to the Nazi command. Volk made it clear that he was opposed to such escalation. Commenters responding to his post were not. “Trying to decide if I will be unhappy or happy to don Freikorps attire. Then what to bring to the party,” said one. Others discussed appropriate armaments—“Ill see your 308 and raise you a 45-70” [sic]—until one Richard Carter trumped them all: “see you all that crap 50 bmg.” He was referring the .50-caliber Browning machine gun, a weapon useful for downing low-flying aircraft. After all, another commenter observed, “The Brownshirts are all liberals now.” 
Another commenter offered a “Side note: Ever notice they don’t try that shit somewhere like Texas or Florida, where the odds are good that Joe Public will ventilate their asses when assaulted.” As it happened, one month later events provided a natural experiment to prove or disprove his hypothesis. 
March 4 was national “March 4 Trump Day.” It was also Confederate Flag Day—though whether coincidence or not is always a difficult question to answer in Trumpland, where what the president’s “respectable” partisans would prefer to keep hidden in the basement is only a dogwhistle away. 
A prelude to the March 4 Trump events played out on February 19, when a complement from the “III% Security Force” armed with rifles stood guard over a pro-Trump rally in Atlanta’s Centennial Olympic Park. The next day, National Rifle Association president Wayne LaPierre went online with a video advertising his appearance at the following week’s Conservative Political Action Conference. The video opened with the words “THEY COULDN’T HANDLE IT,” interposed with clips of Michael Moore calling Donald Trump a fascist and Nancy Pelosi intoning “white supremacist,” then the words, “SO THEY STARTED A WAR,” “AGITATION,” “INSURRECTION,” and “ANARCHY.” All this was interspersed with chaotic images of fire, vandalism, and Madonna at the Women’s March explaining, “I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.” Thereupon LaPierre pledged the NRA would be the spearhead of the counter-resistance: “On Friday, February 24, we fight back.” 
Then in Austin on March 4, a blogger who calls himself Morgoth, after the J.R.R. Tolkien character often interpreted as a stand-in for Satan, filed a dispatch from the pro-Trump rally at Wooldridge Park, sprinkled with pictures of dudes with signs like the one featuring the alt-right iconic image of Pepe in a pilot outfit with the legend “FREE HELICOPTER RIDES” and the silhouette of a woman falling from the sky. “The only contribution we received from the Republican Party was some Trump Pence and MAGA signs,” he boasted. “Quite unlike the AstroTurf leftist protests where professional agitators are organized, bused in and often paid by shadowy group funded for George Soros or the Democratic Party.” [ sic ] Morgoth was impressed with organizers doing “everything possible to dispel the notion that Trump or his supporters are in any way racist. After all, speakers at the event included a black woman . . . and a Mexican woman who had just obtained U.S. citizenship. Amusingly, the Mexican lady’s speech was largely drowned out by long and raucous chants of ‘build the wall, build the wall!’” 
Morgoth estimated the alt-right contingent at 10 to 20 percent of the crowd. He celebrated their chants, including “Free helicopter rides for commies” and “One people, one nation, one leader.” He reported, “The Alt Right were well turned out, many wearing shirts and ties, well groomed, well informed, physically fit, and well versed in their arguments. They stood in stark contrast to the weak degenerates of Antifa . . .” He said the whole thing made him feel as glorious as when he participated in an Orange Walk—those marches where Ulster unionists would parade menacingly through Catholic neighborhoods to celebrate the 1690 defeat of Irish Catholics. He thrilled to what he claimed was evidence that “even mainstream conservatives” were moving “toward us.” 
He also confirmed the accounts of about a dozen anti-Trump protesters that one of them, Austin radical journalist Kit O’Connell, received a concussion when he was smashed against a post by a former Marine after touching his flag. 
O’Connell was arrested and charged with a crime. The attacker was not. O’Connell’s assailant, wearing an American-flag windbreaker, carrying an American flag, and sporting two small American flags in his MAGA cap, can be heard in a video boasting, “He was so light, I thought he was a girl. But I hit him against the pole, and I felt sorry for him so I stopped. . . How do you justify attacking somebody with an American flag? . . .They went after my flag.” 
Morgoth’s blog post in praise of this fine patriot featured a screen grab of O’Connell’s Facebook message. Morgoth’s comment: “Here is a post of the glass jawed communist made on Facebook the next day showing him still in this hospital bed whining about his treatment at the hands of the fascist police state. You’d need a heart of stone not to laugh. . . . Antifa pussy, straight from central casting.” The screen grab contained the name of the hospital, should any local neo-Nazi—like the fellow who recently charged into an Austin anarchist bookstore and threatened to burn them out—wish to visit him. When I reached O’Connell by phone, he told me, “There’s a real feel in the Austin left, especially the far-left, that this counter-resistance is becoming frighteningly organized.” 
And why not? They believe they’re only fighting back. 
A Morgoth commenter who calls himself Gentleman Jim Crow praised the “virile young Alt-Rights clashing with clapped out retrograde commies. The future belongs to us.” Another commenter responded to that, “They will still escalate.” Morgoth himself wrote, “While looking for footage of the Austin march to accompany this post I came across this footage of the violence at the March 4 Trump in Berkeley, California. . . the Trump supporters seem to be more physically capable, but the weaker leftists are prepared to up the ante by introducing cowardly devices like tasers and pepper spray.” 
Students of fascism will recognize the fantastical confusion of tropes: the enemy as a terrifying horde, raising the stakes ruthlessly beyond all civil bounds; but also the enemy as pitiful (“glass jawed”) weaklings—sometimes both within the same utterance. Such language is how students of fascism know that they are in its presence. 
I’ve seen the Berkeley footage Morgoth is referring to. That’s how I made the acquaintance of Stick Man. 
Berkeley’s March 4 Trump was organized by a man named Richard Black, who announced that members of the alt-right, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists were banned. Among those who did not get the memo were Moshe Daniel, who goes by the nickname “Kilt Man.” Daniel depicts himself on Facebook with a giant serrated knife and a T-shirt featuring the face of the late Chilean fascist dictator Augusto Pinochet, the legend “PHYSICAL REMOVAL,” and another of those silhouettes of people being dropped from helicopters—a Pinochet-favored method for dealing with dissenters. 
The march turned into a “small riot,” as gun-rights blogger Bob Owens, one of the most widely read on the web, and a cool and clear-thinking moderate, described it after reviewing the available documentation. “Both sides came to this incident prepared for a fight,” he wrote, concluding it was impossible to see “who threw the first punch.” In my mind, however, there were at least two moments where the person who threw the first punch was starkly evident. In both cases it was an individual who wore all black, from boots to baseball cap, and carried a distinctive black shield emblazoned with a “V” for victory, and an American flag. The man in black also wore a gas mask, surely in response to a widely disseminated urban legend that antifas are routinely attacking protesters with pepper spray. In one video he whacks a downed anti-Trump protester with the long wooden stick he carries (with two tiny American flags attached, thus he can call it a flagpole). In another, he can be seen smashing his stick down so hard on an unarmed protester’s head that the stick breaks in half. 
He’s since become a right-wing folk hero, and, after Berkeley police arrested him on several felony charges, naturally, a right-wing martyr. 
Morgoth declared an image of Stick Man in his getup to be his “picture of the week.” Wrote the proprietor of a blog called Ride the Bomb!, who calls his hero Captain America: “For those who are not aware, the Antifa jerks have been bringing flags to violent protests so that they can use the flag poles to beat Trump supporters over the head. This gentleman’s ‘flagpole’ was a great FU to all of them. My personal favorite video . . . shows Captain America breaking his ‘flagpole’ over the head of an Antifa member. . . . Let us hope now he understands that it was foolish to think that a beta male Liberal wussy boy like him who has never been in a fair fight in his life could brawl with men. I believe that going forward Captain America will serve as in [ sic] inspiration for us all. More than anyone else he will be remembered as the symbol of the turning point represented by the Berkeley ‘March 4 Trump.’” 
Stick Man’s real name is Kyle Chapman of Daly City, California. On Facebook, he can be seen dipping bullets into bacon, apparently for use against Muslims. His favorite books include March of the Titans: A History of the White Race . He likes the Nordic-Germanic Front, Nordic Beauty, Soldiers of Odin USA, and RT. He also has a long criminal history, including felony convictions for charges that include robbery and grand theft. Following a crowdfunding campaign to aid with his bail and defense, he wrote, “The out pouring of support has nearly brought me to tears. I do not consider myself a hero. I’m a patriot that loves freedom and my fellow countrymen. I have long embraced my inner warrior as many of the warrior patriots that have fought along side me. Could not have done it without them. The decadence of the West has made us soft. We must reverse this if our republic is to survive. Let 3.4.17 be the beginning of a new revolution.” Among those who have joined the crowdfunding crusade is Richard Black, the organizer of March 4 Trump, who had banned white nationalists and the alt-right. 
Bob Owens’s post about the March 4 Trump in Berkeley is entitled “Can Trump Supporters Legally Shoot Left-wing ‘Antifa’ Attackers?” He wrote it in response to a Tweet directed to him, noting a moment where three antifas got in three light kicks at a downed Trump supporter, asking, “Looks like lethal self-defense could be justified. Opinions?” Owens assured his readers this was indubitably not so. He reviewed California’s statute on the use of deadly force, which requires a shooter to “reasonably believe” he or she “was in imminent danger of being killed or suffering great bodily injury,” then to use “no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against that danger,” and that “belief in future harm is not sufficient, no matter how greatly or how likely the harm is believed to be.” He concluded, “Both sides acted childishly and violently, but there was no violence that came close to justifying the use of firearms to stop a deadly force attack,” Introducing firearms, he wrote, would have been “frankly stupid, as you’re much more likely to hit innocent bystanders downrange than you are likely to hit the person you’re shooting at in such dense crowds.” 
To which his commenters replied: to hell with that, we’re shooting anyway. They’re not ashamed. They use their real names, and sometimes list their hometown; and, in one case (a firefighter in a small Florida town), their employment, which I confirmed. Then, they say things like this: 
“[W]hen the law says you must die why would you care about the law.” 
“It’s far better to be judged by 12, then carried by 6.” 
“If you physically attack someone you can legally be shot. Doesn’t matter what Kool Aid you drink.” 
“[I]f a person, or persons, are a threat to you or someone else . . . Act accordingly to protect life. Everything else, including the target’s well being, is a by product that is not my concern.” 
“If deadly force isn’t reasonable then why do the cops show up armed???” 
And last but not least: “But let’s face it legalities put aside, killing these ANTIFA douches would probably make America a better place.” 
Just chest-thumping boasts? My friend, a liberal and a Second Amendment advocate, isn’t sure what to think. He hopes “they have jobs and mortgages and kids and so on . . . They have way too much to lose to start shooting at anybody.” 
“But then there’s another part of me that knows how men (and they’re mostly men) of this type are. When you have that much invested in some hardware, and they do have a lot invested as a percentage of income, then you want to use it.” 
Maybe it’s all just idle Internet chatter.

Data Sources: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from their inception up to August 15, 2016 for SSD, BCD, and their synonyms.
Study Selection: In total, 523 articles were retrieved, of which 12 satisfied the eligibility quality criteria. Our outcomes of interest were: 1) the BCD implantation rejection percentage, 2) reasons to reject BCD implantation, and 3) possible prognostic factors predicting the trial outcome.
Data Extraction and Synthesis: At critical appraisal, six studies (n = 471 patients) scored a moderate to high directness of evidence and a medium or low risk of bias and were selected for data extraction. Due to heterogeneity between studies, pooling of data for meta-analysis was not feasible. Therefore, results of studies were summarized per outcome: 1) after the BCD trial, 32.0 to 69.6% of SSD patients rejected BCD implantation, 2) the three main reasons for rejection were experiencing limited benefit from the device, patients fearing or being unfit for surgery and cosmetic aspects, 3) no clear prognostic factors predicting the trial outcome could be identified.
Conclusion: Roughly half of patients rejected BCD implantation after a trial period. From the current literature it is unclear which patients could benefit most from BCD implantation. High level of evidence studies should be conducted to investigate possible prognostic factors that predict the BCD trial outcome.

Book one in the sexy and intense new White Lies duet from New York Times Bestselling Author Lisa Renee Jones! 
There are those moments in life that are provocative in their very existences, that embed in our minds forever, and sometimes our very souls. They change us, mold us, maybe even save us. But some are darker, dangerous. If we allow them to, they control us. Seduce us. Quite possibly even destroy us. 
The moment I walked into Sonoma’s Reid Winter Winery and Vineyard and made eye contact with Faith Winter for the first time was one of those moments. Provocative because I know at least one of her secrets, of which, I suspect she has many. Provocative because she believes I was a stranger to her when we met, but I am not. Provocative because I sought her out, with no intention of touching her. But now I have. Now I want her. Now I have to have her. But that changes nothing. It doesn’t change why I came for her.

This incident led to the passenger being treated in a very disrespectful manner after he refused to give up his seat. The mistreatment by the airline security officer made the matters worse when the passenger started bleeding and people started calling the airline out for discrimination against him because he was Asian.
The video became viral even in China with angry comments and posts regarding it from tens of thousands of users. The problem of the video going viral is still not over as the last article written about it, which is shown in the search results of Google, was published 1 hour ago.
The reason it got viral in the first place was because of the negative response it got, where people from different communities especially China came together to speak against this video on various social media platforms like twitter and Facebook. They talked about boycotting it and after the response of the company’s Chief Executive Oscar Munoz, public outrage reached its peak
“This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers. Our team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened. 
In this day and age where customer service and customer relationship management is of utmost importance for the company to succeed, a response like this let alone an incident which led to trauma for a customer is a big deal. This response was seen as being insensitive.
Companies try and put a face amongst its customers whereby the needs and wants of the customers are put in the highest regard so that they are able to sustain customers in this competitive environment. However, when it comes to United Airlines, that face which was presented in front of others was destroyed. Furthermore, they did not resolve the conflict by using a compromising communication style which they should have. Instead they put their needs above the needs of the customers. They preferred dragging the customers out to make space for their staff. The used a very dominating approach to resolve the matter whereby it seemed that they did the right thing.
The reach of the story seems to be very high. On Google news the first 12 pages (each page displaying 30 articles) is filled with news regarding this particular incident. Social mention site also shows a trending attitude towards this news. Sentiments on the site of United Airlines are as follows:
Positive: 28
Neutral:188
Negative: 6
The exact words “United Airline dragged passenger” has 10% strength, 1:1 sentiments and 4% reach with 3 pages covering with news regarding the event.
Furthermore, through Quintley we can access the various profiles and posts that have been made for United Airlines. Their Facebook page is filled with bad remarks and memes regarding the passenger being dragged out of the airline. There are negative reviews. There are also separate pages like New United Airlines Mottos & Memes dedicated to this. Moreover, on Instagram 4 out of 30 accounts about United Airlines exist with the aim to boycott United Airlines. Tweets using #NewUnitedAirlinesMottos, #UnitedAirlinesAssault and #UnitedAirlinesboycott are being used by a lot of users. The top ones as per the metions website are as follows:
 

This incident unfolded on Sunday, 9 th of April and since then it has been trending. It became viral the very same day, with the news reaching the internet within hours. The rising searches as per Google trends is shown below:

 
This incident, in terms of how the customer service of United Airlines is, reflects a very negative image which is similar to how the problem with Dave Caroll rolled out. However, in my opinion it is much worse than that since a customer rather than his belongings was physically hurt in this case.
The reaction from the company was as casual as it was in the case of Dave Caroll and it was only after the news escalated quickly leading to bad publicity to a great extent that the company apologized. Their response in both cases reflected negligence, a much laid back attitude towards customer care and also showed that their ease was put before their customers. Gauging from this incident, they did not learn much about controlling bad publicity as in both cases the news got viral. Their response was slow in both cases and one can say that their customer service hasn’t improved since then due to such events not being taken care of. What they need is good customer management system, trained staff to cater to the needs of the passengers and a good PR team.",United Airlines manages to make the public furious again,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRU.kUXA93a3ZzsHz450HYtW0DHMQVQrCjn8n0YyTLJ7fbM6eGVmMtUseU9OBlKZSdoM3nod1gWHgoDPI_JzdZCwNOnK5Treg6KmvtB.V8GqyaguYEYZ.r4wT.6t9f5k.Y-,4e34783d2e53feee7fc6a02f5665faa451c53f6b,jaazah.wordpress.com,Not Available,https://jaazah.wordpress.com,United Airlines manages to make the public furious again – Jaazah H.

ZURICH, April 18 Novartis's push into oncology and liver disease, two of its treatment priorities, advanced on Monday as the Swiss drugmaker won a second U.S. breakthrough tag for its cancer gene therapy while striking a separate pact with Allergan. 
The Basel-based drugmaker's chimeric antigen receptor therapy (CAR-T) treatment, called CTL019, was awarded the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's breakthrough therapy designation for adults with relapsed/refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a common blood cancer. 
Novartis also said it will combine one of its investigational drugs with Allergan's cenicriviroc in a mid-stage trial against liver disease known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, that is growing more prevalent due in large part to obesity. 
Novartis's drug development head Vas Narasimhan has highlighted oncology and NASH as two pillars of his strategy to ensure growth. Narasimhan expects CTL019 to eventually top $1 billion in sales for multiple cancer types and also has high hopes for his NASH treatments, in particular in concert with other companies. 
""Collaboration is key to developing the best possible treatments that are urgently needed for NASH patients,"" Narasimhan said in a statement. 
Late last year, Novartis struck a $50 million licensing deal with Conatus Pharmaceuticals for a separate treatment for NASH, an area that has also been tagged as a focus by industry rivals including Gilead and Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
CTL019 previously won accelerated FDA review for treating young people with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). 
Last month, Novartis submitted CTL019 for FDA review in young ALL patients as it races rivals including Kite Pharma to become the first to secure regulators' approval for a CAR-T treatment, where T cells are removed from patients, re-engineered to fight their cancers, then reinfused.

By  Prof Michel Chossudovsky Global Research, April 15, 2017 

Double Standards? Whereas President Donald Trump threatens to wage a preemptive attack against North Korea if Pyongyang goes ahead with its nuclear weapons tests, the NSSA and the US Air Force have announced the carrying out of tests of America’s controversial state of the art B61-12 gravity nuclear bomb. 
In a bitter irony, the announcement of the B61-12 nuclear bomb tests (which took place a month ago at the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada), was made public on exactly the same day (April 13, 2017) as the official (“first time in history”) deployment of America’s “Mother of All Bombs” (MOAB) as part of a counter-terrorism operation against the ISIS in the remote highlands of Afghanistan.  

In practice, the deployment of the MOAB in Afghanistan was a de facto “weapons test”, a “dress rehearsal” in disguise for the subsequent deployment of the largest conventional “non-nuclear weapon ever designed” against underground targets in Iran and North Korea. While the deployment of the MOAB received extensive media coverage (focussing on the “war on terrorism”), the testing of the B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb was not considered newsworthy. 
Disinformation through omission: While the media has its eyes riveted on the “North Korean Nuclear Threat”, these tests of America’s nuclear arsenal are not considered “front-page news”. Why? Because the U.S. public is led to believe that America is NOT a threat to Global Security. 
Meanwhile, the West’s (non-existent) anti-war movement remains mum; nobody is challenging (or threatening) Washington for testing the functionality of America’s latest addition to its nuclear arsenal of more than 7000 nuclear warheads: The new B61-12 (guided) gravity nuclear bomb is heralded as an instrument of peace and global security. Pre-emptive nuclear war does not constitute a threat to humanity. 
Needless to say, the development of the B61-12 is part of a multibillion dollar nuclear weapons modernization program funded by US tax payers. 
The B61-11 and 12 are bunker buster (gravity) bombs with a nuclear warhead, slated to be used on a first strike basis under the doctrine of “pre-emptive” nuclear war against both nuclear and non-nuclear states. 
The MOAB is also a high yield bunker buster bomb, with a conventional warhead and a “non-nuclear” mushroom cloud similar to that of a nuclear bomb. Both the MOAB and the B61-11 (which is actively deployed) are (“officially”) intended to destroy underground military targets (e.g in North Korea and Iran). 
According to the NNSA : 

The non-nuclear [B61-12] test assembly was dropped from an F-16 based at Nellis Air Force Base. The test evaluated both the weapon’s non-nuclear functions as well as the aircraft’s capability to deliver the weapon. 
This event is the first of a series that will be conducted over the next three years to qualify the B61-12 for service. Three successful development flight tests were conducted in 2015. 
Peace-making Bombs 
In 2002, the mini-nukes were recategorized by the US Senate (2001 Nuclear Posture Review), cleared for use in the conventional war theater, thereby foreclosing once and for all the Cold War doctrine of “Mutually Assured Destruction” (MAD) which previously described the use of nukes as part of a doomsday scenario. 
The B61 tactical nuclear weapons (mini-nukes) have an explosive capacity varying between one third and 12 times a Hiroshima bomb. Their use, however, following the US Senate’s 2002 “recategorization” would not require the “green light” from the Commander in Chief (aka Donald Trump). 
The B61-12 has an explosive yield varying from 0.3 kilotons to 50 kilotons. While the test in Nevada was limited to evaluating the functionality of the B61-12, without the need for a nuclear explosion, this decision is nonetheless both “timely” and “significant”. It’s also an instrument of propaganda directed against the DPRK. 
What it implies is that the new B61-12 which is designated to target underground bunker facilities is in the process of being cleared for active deployment. 
North Korea versus the United States 
US public opinion is routinely led to believe that US nukes are harmless (safe for civilians). The devastating consequences (amply documented) of the use of nuclear weapons is carefully obfuscated. In contrast to the nukes developed by North Korea, the US Department of Defense considers both the B61-11 and the new B61-12 as” harmless to the surrounding civilian population because the explosion is underground “, according to “scientific opinion” on contract to the Pentagon. 
While the DPRK’s nukes are considered as bona fide Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and a Threat to Global Security, America’s tactical mini-nukes are categorized as “peace-making bombs”. They’re harmless to civilians according to the military manuals; let’s go head and use them as part of a pre- emptive “humanitarian” war under an R2P mandate (“Responsibility to Protect”). 
Lest we forget, the DPRK has been threatened by the US with nuclear war for more than half a century. Barely a few years after the end of the Korean War (1950-53), the US initiated its deployment of nuclear warheads in South Korea. This deployment in Uijongbu and Anyang-Ni had been envisaged as early as 1956. 
Trump-Style Political Insanity 
All the safeguards of the Cold War era, which categorized the nuclear bomb as “a weapon of last resort”, have been scrapped. “Offensive” military actions using nuclear warheads are now described as acts of “self-defense”. 
In the post Cold war era, US nuclear doctrine was redefined. There is no sanity under the Trump administration as to what is euphemistically called US foreign policy. Trump hasn’t the foggiest idea as to the consequences of nuclear war. Nor does he have an understanding of the workings of US foreign policy. 
At no point since the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6th, 1945, has humanity been closer to the unthinkable… (Image of Hiroshima in the wake of the bombing) 
Stay informed, spread the word far and wide. To reverse the tide of war, the broader public must be informed. Post on Facebook/Twitter.

“On August 6, 2003, on Hiroshima Day, commemorating when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima (August 6 1945), a secret meeting was held behind closed doors at Strategic Command Headquarters at the Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. 
Senior executives from the nuclear industry and the military industrial complex were in attendance. This mingling of defense contractors, scientists and policy-makers was not intended to commemorate Hiroshima. The meeting was intended to set the stage for the development of a new generation of “smaller”, “safer” and “more usable” nuclear weapons, to be used in the “in-theater nuclear wars” of the 21st Century. 
In a cruel irony, the participants to this secret meeting, which excluded members of Congress, arrived on the anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing (August 6) and departed on the anniversary of the attack on Nagasaki (August 9).” (Michel Chossudovsky, Towards a World War III Scenario, The Dangers of Nuclear War, Global Research, Montreal, 2012) Click the link above to order directly from Global Research.

AFP Photo By Reuters - April 17, 2017 @ 2:21pm 
SEOUL: Pre-orders for Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone have exceeded those of its predecessor, the S7, the firm's mobile chief said on Thursday, suggesting that consumers are unfazed by last year's Galaxy Note 7 fire debacle. 
Strong initial demand for the S8 will be encouraging for a firm recovering from one of the worst product safety failures in tech history, which ended in the Note 7's swift withdrawal. 
The new smartphone has received favourable reviews ahead of the start of sales in South Korea, the United States and Canada on April 21. Some investors and analysts have even predicted a first-year sales record for the South Korean company. 
""It's still a bit early, but initial response to the pre-orders that have begun at various places across the world have been better than expected,"" mobile chief Koh Dong-jin said at an S8 media briefing. 
He said the S8 will be the safest Galaxy smartphone to date due to measures implemented to avoid the battery failures that caused some Note 7s to spontaneously combust. 
Analysts said strong S8 sales are likely to help Samsung achieve its best-ever quarterly profit in April-June, along with a booming memory chip market that is widely expected to deliver record revenue this year for the industry as a whole. 
Brand Recovery 
Samsung has been working to restore investor trust as well as its reputation since the Note 7's withdrawal in Oct within two months of being on the market, losing out on US$5.4 billion in profit. 
Senior executives told foreign media on the sidelines of the briefing that it will take time for Samsung's brand image to recover. They also said Samsung has seen a rebound in consumer sentiment towards the firm since announcing the results of a probe into the fires and preventative measures on Jan 23. 
""It took Toyota about four years for its brand to get back to where it was, and I think ours can do it faster,"" said Lee Young-hee, an executive vice president at Samsung's mobile business, referring to a series of Toyota Motor Corp vehicle recalls from 2009 to 2011. 
S8 advertising focuses on features such as almost bezel-less screens rather than highlighting safety. Executives said this was deliberate in the belief that Samsung has done enough to convince consumers the Note 7's problems will not be repeated. 
""We felt really comfortable that we had attained a level of confidence with consumers so that we could actually shift to the product campaign,"" said Pio Schunker, global head of integrated marketing for Samsung's mobile business. 
""Ultimately, I think it is this product that proves this case,"" he added. 96 reads ","Samsung Galaxy S8 pre-orders surpass S7's, exceed expectations | New Straits Times | Malaysia General Business Sports and Lifestyle News",http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_lufladZLR6BBmrVNa_tuMkC3TCenAR0O7MvTqkWUWHTNkJlrz84eqXoVUWIQNzkBzaFkMHLQ_b_CqM8C89W.CfIlQmqCwv5RGi5sgxUlbVqKGJrj2eyLEkKi9JS_NcarEXbiePWAHIfJHEkPAm5iM,51552a894102d91d21a6224f0be1ccb73c02ca65,www.nst.com.my,http://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/313samsung_field_image_listing_featured.var_1492410106.jpg,,,US,35739.0,0,nst.com.my,0,"Samsung Galaxy S8 pre-orders surpass S7's, exceed expectations | New Straits Times | Malaysia General Business Sports and Lifestyle News",0.353,news,0,"[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'koh dong-jin'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'pio schunker'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'lee young-hee'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'malaysia'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'canada'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'south korea'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'seoul'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'united states'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'seoul'}]","[{'sentiment': 'neutral', 'name': 'samsung galaxy s8'}, {'sentiment': 'neutral', 'name': 'new straits times'}, {'sentiment': 'neutral', 'name': 'lifestyle news samsung galaxy s8'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'brand recovery  samsung'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'toyota'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'samsung electronics co ltd'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'reuters'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'samsung'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'toyota motor corp'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'samsung electronics'}]"

Cat Got Your Cash 
By Julie Chase 
Kitty Couture #2 
Crooked Lane Books, 2017 


Summary 

Lacy Marie Crocker’s whimsical pet couture has gained a following in New Orleans’s cozy Garden District, and word of mouth has traveled all the way to her favorite fashion designer, Annie Lane. Lacy’s thrilled when Annie schedules a private session at her home to discuss a companion line for her evening wear, but when Lacy arrives for the appointment, she enters the kitchen to two mewling Siamese cats–and one very dead Annie. 

Lacy takes the kittens home to care for them until they can be properly claimed by Annie’s family or friends, but after a busy day of work, she returns home to find them missing. And when Lacy learns the cats are set to inherit Annie’s fortune, she begins to wonder if the killer was after the kittens all along. Now Lacy will stop at nothing to save the Siamese and find justice for Annie–if the killer doesn’t sink his claws into her first. 

Luckily, Lacy has the help of handsome NOLA PD homicide detective Jack Oliver to help her catch the cat-napper before it ’ s too late in Cat Got Your Cash, the endearing second Kitty Couture mystery from Julie Chase. 


My thoughts 

I ado r e Julie Chase’s Kitty Coutu r e se r ies and it has quickly become one of my favo r ites. Lacy, as well as the othe r cha r acte r s and pets in he r wo r ld, have good depth and the New O r leans setting spa r kles. Lacy’s cat, Penelope, is so funny! The idea of a pet boutique and o r ganic bake r y is a totally fo r eign concept to me, but I love Lacy’s Fu rr y Godmothe r shop (and I suspect my kitties would also). 

Cat Got You r Cash is an app r op r iate title, with the victim’s cats supposedly inhe r iting thei r owne r ’s fo r tune. This is a pe r fect cozy, with a good blend of c r azy myste r y plotting and r omance. Lacy has two r omantic inte r ests, a plot vehicle I’m not pa r ticula r ly fond of, especially since I’m ve r y much on “Team Jack”! Hopefully this will be r esolved soon. 

This sto r y stands alone, but I r ecommend r eading the sto r ies in o r de r fo r the best unde r standing. Cat Got You r Cash is a fun myste r y with a nice twist at the end. I look fo r wa r d to the next adventu r e in this se r ies.

According to a proxy filing made on Friday, which its board of directors have recommended a vote against, the shareholders also want the report to look into the dangers fake news may pose to the company itself. The proposal, which suggests the company review the issue broadly, said Facebook had provided “a financial mechanism supporting fabricated content” on the internet. Reuters news agency reports, Saturday, that it also includes the extent to which it blocks fake posts, how its strategies impact free speech and how it evaluates claims in posts. According to the proposal, “Facebook is highly vulnerable, as fake news promoters are spamming their way to visibility for fake news through strategically gaming Facebook’s algorithms and publishing platform.” It added that, “In light of the societal crisis generated by the explosion of fake news and related hate speech, failure to effectively manage this issue creates public policy risk.” The U.S. presidential election of 2016 brought the fake news issue to the radar, as many inaccurate posts were widely shared on Facebook and other social media services. The social platform, however, said it was tackling the problem. On Thursday, more than 30,000 accounts were suspended in France, ahead of the country’s presidential election. Similarly, the media platform already has a program in France to use outside fact-checkers to combat fake news in users’ feeds. Meanwhile, shareholders also proposed a gender pay equality report be prepared by December, with recommendations that the company disclose the percentage pay gap between male and female employees across race and ethnicity and the policies taken to address the gap. Additionally, they want the media platform to state the methodology used to take those measures as well as targets that could be set to reduce the gap.

This article is a non-exhaustive list of political achievements (and failures) of United States President Donald Trump (and also Congress ) in passing conservative legislation, advancing conservative ideals, and ""Making America Great Again"". 
When adding additional examples, please add at least one reliable source for each example for future reference. Contents Republican National Convention and 2016 election Primaries and convention See also: 2016 U.S. presidential election#Primaries and convention The National Rifle Association strongly endorsed Trump in May 2016 in one of its earliest endorsements ever, before Trump became the official GOP nominee. [1] [2] The Republican Party drafted and approved a very conservative platform in 2016. [3] Among its many provisions was very strong pro-life language that recognized the right to life of unborn human beings and condemning Planned Parenthood . [4] Historic general election victory 
Not only did Trump experience a major and historic election victory upset, winning states like Wisconsin , Pennsylvania , and Michigan , that Republicans had not won in years, but they broke other records and won in other levels of government as well. Trump Transition 
Despite not even being inaugurated, Trump made several notable accomplishments. November 2016 — In an effort to ""Drain the Swamp,"" Trump instituted a 5-year lobbying ban for potential administration picks as well as transition team members. [5] This is much longer than Barack Obama 's ban, which was for two years. [6] After Trump's election and because of his strong criticism of outsourcing, numerous businesses have specifically backed off from outsourcing jobs to foreign nations, citing Trump as either the reason or a large reason. [7] [8] [9] In June 2016, President Barack Obama told a Carrier employee at a town hall meeting that there was nothing that could be done about the trend of jobs leaving America. Less than a month after Trump’s election win, Carrier tweeted that they reached a deal with the President-elect to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indiana. Trump also motivated Ford to scrap their plans for a $1.6 billion plant planned for Mexico and instead will invest $700 million in a Michigan assembly plant creating 700 new jobs. [10] Trump picked the most conservative cabinet , at least in recent U.S. history. [11] [12] In addition, rather than picking establishment Washington RINOs with worthless governmental experience in the capital city , Trump chose an unorthodox cabinet of true conservatives, small-government proponents, and outsiders. [13] [14] Additionally, Trump nominated David Friedman —one of the most pro- Israel figures in the entire world—as U.S. ambassador to Israel (which other Republicans likely would not have done), [15] [16] and he ordered all of Obama's ambassadors to leave by Inauguration Day. [17] [18] December 2016 — In foreign policy, even before being inaugurated, Trump broke decades of leftist policy instituted by liberal Jimmy Carter by answering a phone call from the president of Taiwan , which showed he is able to stand up to the ""People's"" ""Republic"" of China . [19] [20] December 2016/January 2017 — Trump criticized Boeing and Lockheed Martin for selling the U.S. overpriced weaponry (including the failed F-35 Lightning II program), and he criticized Boeing for planning an extremely overpriced new Air Force One . [21] After criticizing Boeing over Air Force One and meeting with its executives, the company's CEO assured Trump that the new plane would not be over budget. [22] January 2017 — Trump stopped the GOP-controlled House from changing the House Ethics Oversight panel rules after tweeting against the change. [23] While the panel does have problems that the proposed change would address and many fake MSM news surrounding it, [24] Trump reminded the House to focus first on helping the American people rather than themselves. Due to Trump's election, U.S. generals in Iraq fighting the Islamic State began taking greater freedom to conduct operations in the way they saw fit. [25] As U.S. President Trump being sworn in, January 20, 2017. 
Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017, giving one of the strongest inauguration addresses in American history. [26] [27] [28] His first bill signed as president was to allow retired general and Defense Secretary nominee James Mattis to be confirmed. [29] Trump had a very busy and productive first week, undoing Obama's legacy and instituting conservative executive orders. [30] [31] [32] He made a large impact by his 50th day in office. [33] 
Due to his promotion and support of conservative, America First [34] policies, President Trump faced large opposition from the left, including from within the government bureaucracy. [35] [36] (The fact that members of the Deep State have grown visibly scared of reports stating such confirms this view. [37] ) As a testament to the deep opposition and hatred towards him by the left-wing, at least 217 violent protestors were arrested in Washington D.C. on Inauguration Day. [38] [39] Additionally, Senate Democrats unduly delayed Trump's cabinet nominees at historic and unprecedented proportions—by February 8, 2017, only George Washington had fewer cabinet nominees confirmed by this length of time into his presidency. [40] As in the 2016 presidential election, the mainstream media strongly opposed Trump and wrote him off as a failure early in his presidency, despite his numerous accomplishments by that time. [41] 
Congressional Republicans were more united during Trump's presidency than in any other time in recent U.S. political history. [42] Social policy Legislation signed March 27, 2017—One of the four Congressional Review bills that Trump signed into law that day repealed Obama's Blacklisting Rule , which would have required firms contracted by federal agencies to release every claim of unfair labor practices concerning them – something which would have given unionized contractors an upper-hand. On the same day, President Trump signed an executive order repealing the contracting rule. [43] Executive actions January 20, 2017—On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that would lessen Obamacare 's burden while Republicans work to repeal and replace the failed bureaucratic law. [44] [45] February 9, 2017—President Trump signed three executive orders pertaining to law enforcement. The first cracked down and strengthens the law against international crime organizations, the second deals with anti-law enforcement crimes, and third with finding a strategy for reducing crime in general, ""including, in particular, illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and violent crime."" [46] February 22, 2017—President Trump rescinded former President Obama's pro- transgender guidelines for schools receiving federal aid that are subject to Title IX . [47] A day earlier, the Trump Administration announced it would discontinue Obama's pro-transgender policies. [48] March 27, 2017—President Trump signed an executive order repealing Obama-era requirements for federal contractors, along with signing a bill that day on the same topic. [43] April 3, 2017—Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the Department of Justice to review Obama's agreements with local police departments. Sessions made this order to give back local control to police departments. [49] April 14, 2017—President Trump appointed Roger Severino, a strong defender of religious liberty , to the HHS Office for Civil Rights. [50] [51] April 14, 2017—The Justice Department dropped its lawsuit against North Carolina that alleged discrimination with its ""bathroom bill"" (filed under the Obama Administration) after a compromise bill was passed. Homosexual activists still opposed the new bill. [52] Abortion Legislation signed April 13, 2017—President Trump signed a Congressional Review bill into law annulling a pending Obama Administration regulation that would have required states to fund abortion organizations such as Planned Parenthood . [53] The Act was ""the first major national pro-life bill in more than a decade."" [54] Executive actions January 23, 2017—President Trump signed an order reinstating the Mexico City Policy , which defunded International Planned Parenthood and other organizations that promote foreign abortions. [55] [56] April 4, 2017—The Trump Administration halted U.S. funding of the United Nations Population Fund, which has links to inhumane abortion programs such as China 's one-child policy . Instead, the $32.5 million was shifted to the U.S. Agency for International Development. [57] Gun politics Legislation signed February 28, 2017—President Trump signed a bill into law (Public Law 115-8) [58] repealing a Social Security Administration rule adding mental disability determinations to the background check registry, subject to a person applying to be removed from the list. [59] [60] [61] Congress had passed a law requiring federal agencies to search their records for people who were ""mentally defective"", and the Social Security Administration had published their method of gathering names on December 16, 2016. The regulation would have added the names of disability beneficiaries who have a mental illness or are not competent to manage their own finances, potentially leading to the removal of Second Amendment rights to many perfectly competent, mentally healthy citizens. [60] [62] By signing the resolution of disapproval, the Social Security Administration cannot come up with different criteria for supplying names to the background check registry for 10 years. Executive actions Starting early in his presidency, the Trump Administration has undone Obama-era executive branch gun regulations. [63] Immigration, illegal immigration, and border security 
According to data released early in Trump's presidency, illegal border crossings decreased by 40% in the first month of Trump's presidency – a remarkable achievement, considering that illegal immigration usually increases by 10 to 20% in January and February. [64] [65] In March, illegal immigration had fallen by over 60%. [66] It was reported in April that illegal immigration levels had fallen to the lowest point in 17 years. [67] Illegal immigration dropped so much that U.S. Customs and Border Protection was able to close on of their temporary holding facilities. [68] This drop was probably due to the Trump effect . [69] 
President Trump worked to eliminate Obama's legacy of giving privileges to illegal immigrants in detention centers. [70] At the same time, the Trump Administration expanded immigration enforcement efforts, such as through building additional detention centers. [71] Legislation signed Trump signing his Jan. 27, 2017 order regarding refugees and travel from high-risk countries. Countries affected by Trump's Jan. 27, 2017 travel ban. January 25, 2017—Trump signed two executive orders. The first one included ordering the ""immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border,"" the hiring of 5,000 additional border control agents, and ending ""catch-and-release"" policies for illegal immigrants. The second order called for hiring an additional 10,000 federal immigration officers, re-establishing the Secure Communities Program and other local partnerships, making the deportation of criminal illegal immigrants a priority, directing the State Department to use leverage to ensure countries-of-origin take back illegal immigrants, and stripping federal grant money from sanctuary cities and states . [72] [73] January 25, 2017—Trump promised to investigate voter fraud in the U.S. While this appears to have only been an announcement of a future action, it shows that President Trump is serious about voter fraud. [74] January 27, 2017—Trump signed an executive order indefinitely banning the admission of Syrian refugees, suspending the overall refugee program for 120 days, suspending entry and the issuing of visas from seven failed Middle Eastern countries [75] for at least 90 days, and reducing the number of refugees allowed into the nation during the fiscal year from 110,000 to 50,000. [76] [77] [78] Additionally, Trump made clear that he would help Christian refugees, a reversal from the Obama Administration. [79] Despite criticism from leftists and non-conservatives, 49 percent of the American public supported the decision compared to 41 percent opposed, according to the ""mainstream"" Reuters, [80] and 57% percent of likely American voters supported the ban according to Rasmussen. [81] Additionally, while the leftist establishment European leaders opposed the ban, a strong majority—55% average—of Europeans support the ban, according to a poll in 10 European Union nations. [82] [83] March 6, 2017—President Trump signed a second executive order concerning the temporary suspension of refugees and others from certain high-risk countries after the first one was blocked by the courts. The second order made some clarifications and minor improvements over the first, such as exempting green card holders from the ban and excluding Iraq from it as it had developed an acceptable vetting process. [84] [85] On March 31, 2017, after talking tough against ""sanctuary cities"" and illegal immigration, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a plan to speed up the deportation of imprisoned illegals. [86] [87] On April 11, 2017, Sessions issued a memorandum to U.S. attorneys, instructing them to enforce much stricter guidelines against immigration crimes, [88] and he announced the Justice Department would hire 125 immigration judges in the next two years. [89] Late March/Early April 2017—The Trump Administration cracked down on H-1B visas in a series of actions, making it much more difficult for entry-level programmers to enter the U.S., combating corruption in the program, and making sure that Americans were not discriminated against. [90] April 14, 2017—President Trump appointed two conservatives on immigration issues to senior positions in the Department of Homeland Security. [91] Energy and environmental policy Legislation signed February 14, 2017 - Trump signed H.J.Res.41 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of a rule submitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to ""Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers"" (see ""Size of Government"" section below). [92] Executive actions January 24, 2017—Trump signed two orders reviving consideration for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline projects, which Obama halted due to supposed environmental concerns. [93] On March 24, 2017, the Trump Administration approved the Keystone XL Pipeline. [94] January 24, 2017—In addition to the above, Trump signed three other orders, one requiring the United States Secretary of Commerce make a plan within six months mandating all new or improved pipelines be made with American steel, another order requiring every federal agency to streamline manufacturing regulations, and the third allowing fast-track approval for important infrastructure projects. [95] March 18, 2017—The Trump Administration forced the G-20 to remove any mention of climate change from its joint statement. [96] [97] (See ""Foreign policy"" section below) March 28, 2017—President Trump signed a major executive order repealing several Obama-era environmental regulations unfavorable to coal. In addition to this, the order started an immediate review of Obama's Clean Power Plan, help create American energy jobs, bring American energy independence by stimulating domestic energy production, and giving authority back to the states. [98] [99] Economic policy Legislation signed Executive actions February 3, 2017—Trump signed an order directing Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, upon his confirmation, to plan changes to the Dodd-Frank bank regulatory law in order to cut much of it. [100] [101] Trade Legislation signed Executive actions January 23, 2017—Trump signed an order which withdrew the United States from the globalist Trans-Pacific Partnership . [102] March 18, 2017—The Trump Administration forced the G-20 to remove its opposition to protectionism and its support for free trade from its joint statement. [103] [104] (See ""Foreign policy"" section below) March 31, 2017—President Trump signed two orders. The first order instituted a crackdown on violations of anti- dumping laws and help to officials to collect penalties already owed to the U.S. The second order ordered a report by the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative on the causes of the U.S. trade deficit due within 90 days. [105] [106] Foreign policy President Trump being briefed on April 6, 2017 concerning a military strike on Syria. 
President Trump was observed early in his presidency to have adopted a strong foreign policy. [107] This was as opposed to Barack Obama's foreign policy. [108] As the North Korean vice-foreign minister stated, Trump's foreign policy was ""more vicious and more aggressive"" than that of Barack Obama. [109] Fox News reported that the Trump Administration has adopted a more critical stance toward the United Nations than the Obama Administration. [110] Legislation signed Executive actions February 3, 2017—After Iran tested a ballistic missile in apparent violation of a UN Security Council resolution, the Trump Administration instituted unilateral economic sanctions against 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies. [111] [112] March 2017—After the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia authored a destructive and anti-Semitic [113] [114] report against Israel , the report and agency were strongly criticized by the United States and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley , and the executive director of the commission resigned in response. [115] [116] On March 18, 2017, the Trump Administration successfully forced the G-20 to remove its opposition to protectionism and temper its support for free trade , [103] [104] and any mention of climate change [96] [97] from its joint statement. Later, in April 2017, the Trump Administration refused to sign the G7 joint statement because the other nations could not agree to include support for nuclear and fossil fuels without support for the Paris climate agreement. The G7, thus, went without a joint statement. [117] [118] April 6, 2017—After the Syrian government used chemical weapons on its people, President Trump ordered a one-time airstrike against a Syrian air base, firing 60 cruise missiles at it. [119] The U.S. destroyed about 20 Syrian jet planes and caused extremely heavy damage on the base. [120] Defense Secretary James Mattis stated the attacks destroyed 20% of Syria's operational aircraft. [121] As even the New York Times reported, Trump's action was a show of U.S. strength, and it was in stark contrast to Obama, as Trump used surprise and speed in the attacks. [122] World leaders supported the strong action. [123] This was the first direct military action the U.S. took against the Assad regime. [124] MOAB, the ""Mother Of All bombs"" April 13, 2017—Under the increased autonomy President Trump have to his generals, [125] the U.S. dropped a GBU-43B (also known as MOAB or the ""Mother Of All bombs""), the largest non- nuclear bomb in existence at 21,000 pounds on a complex of Islamic State tunnels in Afghanistan . Although tested in 2003, the bomb had never been used in combat before. [126] It was estimated to have killed 36 ISIS fighters, [127] including ISIS commander Siddiq Yar. [128] Size of Government 
President Trump and Congress spent much time rolling back regulations, particularly those created by Obama. [129] [130] In the first six weeks of Trump's presidency, over 90 regulations were repealed, whether through executive orders, Acts of Congress, or other means [131] [132] — clearly keeping his promises. [133] He has successfully made use of Congressional Review numerous times to roll back Obama-era regulations—even more than expected. [134] [135] Prior to Trump's presidency, the Congressional Review Act had been used only once successfully, sixteen years prior. [136] Legislation signed February 14, 2017—President Trump signed a bill into law repealing an Obama Era relation requiring energy companies to disclose financial transactions with foreign governments. [92] [137] [138] February 16, 2017—President Trump signed a bill into law blocking the ""Stream Protection Rule,"" an environmental regulation. [139] [140] March 27, 2017—President Trump signed four bills undoing Obama-era regulations. [134] [141] Two of those bills rolled back federal education regulations. [142] March 31, 2017—President Trump signed another bill undoing an Obama-era regulation, giving the power back to the states to expand drug testing for unemployment benefit applicants. [143] April 3, 2017—President Trump signed a bill reversing an Obama-era FCC privacy regulation applicable to internet service providers. The FCC had adopted the rule to fill a gap created by a court case which ruled that the FTC did not have jurisdiction to extend its privacy rule over internet service providers because they were regulated by the FCC. The new law repealed the FCC rule and prohibits the FCC from enacting a replacement for 10 years without giving the FTC jurisdiction to regulate internet service providers' privacy practices. [144] Part of yet another series of bills undoing other Obama regulations. [145] Executive actions January 20, 2017—On its first day in office, the Trump Administration ordered a regulatory freeze on all federal governmental agencies. [146] On Inauguration Day, 2017, the Trump administration instituted a federal hiring freeze. [147] On January 23, 2017, Trump signed an executive order instituting the hiring freeze, from which the military was exempted. [148] On April 12, 2017, the hiring freeze was replaced with a plan to restructure and shrink the executive branch. [149] [150] January 30, 2017—Trump signed an executive order that requires two federal regulations must be eliminated for every regulation created. [151] [152] [153] February 3, 2017—President Trump signed a memorandum directing the United States Department of Labor to review a regulation signed by Obama set to go into effect. [154] February 24, 2017—President Trump signed an executive order requiring every federal agency to create a ""regulatory reform task force"" to find unnecessary, burdensome regulations to repeal. [155] This order was called ""the most far reaching effort to pare back U.S. red tape in recent decades."" [156] February 28, 2017—President Trump announced that he did not plan on filling numerous government positions he considered unnecessary. [157] According to one source, about 2,000 positions were vacant, and most of them were likely included in this list. [158] As of April 4, 2017, President Trump did not make a nomination for nearly 500 positions requiring Senate confirmation. [159] March 13, 2017—President Trump signed an executive order to perform an audit on every executive branch agency in order to reduce spending and waste and improve services. [160] [161] [162] Military Legislation signed Executive actions January 27, 2017—Trump signed a memorandum to begin the expansion and rebuilding of the U.S. military. [163] [164] February 3, 2017—The Trump Administration and Lockheed Martin reached a tentative deal that would purchase 90 F-35 jet at the lowest price in the program's history. [165] Proclamations January 20, 2017—The day he was inaugurated, Trump instituted a national day of patriotism for the country, [166] and a few days later Trump officially designated his inauguration day the National Day of Patriotic Devotion . [167] [168] January 22–28, 2017— National School Choice Week , as proclaimed by President Trump [169] Other On January 5, 2017, the U.S. House passed a motion condemning Obama's allowing a leftist anti-Israel resolution to pass in the UN. [170] [171] Additionally, Trump voiced his strong support for Israel during his transition. [172] [173] January 20, 2017—On the day he took office, Trump returned the bust of UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the Oval Office that Obama removed when he took office. [174] He also accepted the United Kingdom 's offer to re-loan the second identical bust of Churchill, which Obama removed and returned after the first loan expired. [175] January 28, 2017—Trump signed an executive order banning administration officials from lobbying their federal agencies for five years, as well as banning them for life from lobbying foreign nations and political parties. [176] [177] January 30, 2017—Trump showed he would not tolerate incompetent leftist administration officials when he fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates (a left-wing Obama holdover) when she refused to defend his refugee and immigration ban executive order. [178] [179] Trump emulated Ronald Reagan 's firing of the striking PATCO workers in 1981 by doing so, [180] contrary to the mainstream media spin. [181] That same night, Trump replaced the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (another Obama holdover) with a more competent official who had a reputation for enforcing immigration laws. [182] [183] March 10, 2017—Conservative attorney General Jeff Sessions asked the 46 remaining U.S. attorneys appointed by Obama, arguably the most left-wing president in U.S. history, to resign. [184] [185] One of those U.S. attorneys was the failed Zachary Fardon, who was lax in his prosecution of gun crimes (Sessions directed the Justice Department to increase prosecutions on gun-law violations and to reinforce harsh sentences for such). [186] When one of those attorneys, Preet Bharara, refused to resign (likely for political gain), he was fired. [187] March 21, 2017—President Trump signed a bill into law not only funding NASA , but setting a goal of having humans visit Mars ""in the 2030s"" and potentially colonizing another planet. [188] The bill also funded the agency, the first time such a bill was signed into law in seven years. [189] Non-legislative or policy achievements Trump has been bold enough to meet with conservative, right-wing figures who stand boldly for small government and conservatism, unlike many other Republicans. For example, he met with Alex Jones , becoming the first president to have ever met with Alex Jones (the meeting occurred during the campaign). [190] Also, Trump has had very strong relations with Nigel Farage of the United Kingdom Independence Party ., [191] [192] Trump has stood up to political correctness and the left-wing consensus in numerous aspects, most notably for rejecting political correctness and communicating directly to the public rather than the mainstream media . Also, Trump has been bold in rejecting the term ""happy holidays."" January 20, 2017—Trump became the first president to say ""radical Islamic terrorism"" in his inaugural address. [28] [193] January 27, 2017—Vice President Mike Pence became the first vice president in United States history to speak at the annual March for Life march in Washington D.C. [194] [195] Additionally, Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway also spoke at the event, and Trump himself strongly expressed his support for the march. [196] [197] March 1, 2017—The Trump Administration played a large role in successfully helping prevent CIA officer Sabrina de Sousa from being extradited to Italy. [198] President Trump and his administration have not been afraid to criticize the left-wing Obama Administration for its failures, such as its failed and broken ""red line"" promise concerning the Syrian Civil War . [199] The courts Supreme Court President Trump announcing his nomination of Gorsuch, January 31, 2017. 
On January 31, 2017, Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court . [200] [201] The nomination was well received by many conservatives. [202] [203] Others, however, most notably Andrew Schlafly , disagreed with the nomination due to concerns about Gorsuch's position on abortion. [204] [205] The Senate ultimately confirmed Gorsuch on a vote of 54–45, even though the GOP was forced to initiate the nuclear option and lowering the vote threshold to overturn a filibuster for Supreme Court nominees due to Democrat obstructionism. [206] Gorsuch assumed office on April 10, 2017. [207] Trump and the stock market 
With expectations that Trump's election victory would cause the markets to plunge, the Dow Jones Industrial Average actually performed very strongly, closing at the highest level it had ever reached in history after the second day. [208] It is rare for the stock market to rise immediately after a U.S. presidential election regardless of the winner. [208] The stock market had its best week in five years due to optimism of a Trump presidency. [209] 
Trump was very busy in his first week and showed he was serious about his campaign promises. This caused the stock market to increase, and the Dow Jones passed 20,000 points for the first time in its history. [210] [211] On March 1, 2017, the day after Trump made his first address to a joint-session of Congress, the stock market rose dramatically again, with the Dow Jones passing the 21,000 mark for the first time in history. [212] [213] [214] Donald Trump's victories over the liberal media establishment See also: Fake news and Liberal media Donald Trump helped further discredit the mainstream media due to his repeatedly challenging their honesty and by demonstrating that their predictions regarding his candidacy were repeatedly false. Americans who trust the media is at 32%, an all time low, according to the Gallup organization. [215] Additionally, between the 2016 election and late January, trust in the media fell from 21 to 15 percent among Trump voters, and even among Clinton voters it fell from 57 to 51 percent. [216] Donald Trump's humor has cut down leading media figures to size. He told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that if Megyn Kelly didn't repeatedly attack him, her audience would be even smaller than Blitzer's. When asked by George Stephanopoulos what his biggest mistakes were on the campaign trail, he pointed that Stephanopoulos has regrets too and pointed out his donation to the Clinton Foundation. [217] At an hour-long press conference on February 16, 2017, Trump repeatedly criticized the press as biased and ""so dishonest ... out of control."" [218] On February 17, 2017, Trump tweeted: ""The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!"" [219] On February 24, 2017, President Trump excluded several liberal media organizations from attending a press briefing. [220] [221] Donald Trump's establishment of a massive direct line to the public via social media 
Via Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, Donald Trump has established a massive direct link to the American public which is unfiltered by the mainstream media. His social media audience is about 45 million people. [222] Donald Trump's association with conservative media 
Rather than associate with the leftist mainstream media, Trump has associated himself with the conservative media , particularly Fox News . [223] He also became the first president to have ever met with Alex Jones (the meeting occurred during the campaign). [190] Failures January 31, 2017—President Trump announced he would keep a 2014 executive order signed by former President Obama that gave protected status to homosexual employees of the government and federal contractors. [224] [225] Additionally, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner reportedly derailed a proposed executive order protecting religious liberty at the same time. [226] However, supporters of homosexual privileges claimed that a March 27, 2017 order, which repealed much of Obama's 2014 executive order, went against Trump's statement to keep the 2014 Obama order (which, if true, would annul this supposed failure). [227] February 2, 2017—Trump stated that building new settlements in the West Bank ""may not be helpful"" to achieving peace in the Middle East , and he appeared to shift his formerly strong stance on moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem as he had previously stated. [228] President Trump did not sign an executive order ending ""no gun zones"" on schools early in his presidency as promised. [229] February 2017—Despite enacting a crackdown on illegal immigration, [230] President Trump announced he would keep DACA, which basically allows illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to stay. [231] President Trump and congressional Republicans did not repeal and replace ObamaCare immediately or quickly as promised. [232] They failed to agree on or pass a replacement bill for ObamaCare as a part of 2017 budget reconciliation. They withdrew the bill to avoid losing a vote on the House floor. [233] [234] This may not have been a total failure, as polling indicated that only 17% of Americans supported the bill, [235] and its passage would have likely led the GOP to an electoral failure in 2018. [236] Some commentators have stated that Trump used this failure in order to further his agenda in the long run, [237] and Trump himself made clear he was not finished with the issue. [238] As of early April 2017, several Obama-holdovers still hold their positions in the Trump Administration with little to no indication of leaving. [239] [240] As of March 9, 2017, President Trump has not fired Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen , who targeted conservative groups under the Obama Administration. [241] Trump also stated he had no plans on asking FBI director James Comey to resign. [242] In April 2017, President Trump stated he had chosen not to label China a currency manipulator, contrary to a campaign pledge. [243] This action is disputable as a failure, as he said he changed his mind ""because he now believes that China hasn't been manipulating its currency for months and because labeling Beijing a manipulator might jeopardize his talks with the Chinese on confronting the threat of North Korea."" [244] Trump also changed his mind regarding the Export-Import Bank of Washington .

As a result, they continue to reap the benefits of increased profitability, enhanced guest experiences, and improved community relations. In addition, as industry standards are codified and adopted worldwide, hotels can now compare how their operations measure up against their competitors in terms of sustainable practices and accomplishments. This capacity to publicly compare and contrast is spurring competition and driving innovation as hotels do not wish to be left behind in this area. Water management and conservation is still a primary issue as population growth, urbanization, pollution and wasteful consumption patterns place increasing demands on freshwater supply. Water recycling; installing low-flow fixtures; using digital sensors to control water usage; and even harvesting rainwater are just a few things that some hotels are doing to preserve this precious resource. Waste management is another major concern. Through policies of reduce, reuse and recycle, some hotels are implementing ?zero-waste? programs with the goal of substantially reducing their landfill waste which produces carbon dioxide and methane gases. Other hotels have established comprehensive training programs that reinforce the value of sustainability. There is employee engagement through posters and quizzes, and even contests are held to increase innovation, sensitivity and environmental awareness. Some hotels are also monitoring a guest?s energy usage and rewarding those who consumed less energy with gifts and incentives. The May issue of the Hotel Business Review will document how some hotels are integrating eco-friendly practices into their operations and how they and the environment are benefiting from them.

Major League Baseball umpires could start explaining replay decisions to the players and fans _ the way NFL referees do _ later this season if the sides can reach agreement. Under one possible scenario, the crew chief could wear a microphone beginning at the All-Star Game. (AP Photo/Brandon Wade) 
Adrian Gonzalez dives headfirst into home, seems to beat the tag by Cubs catcher Willson Contreras, but is called out. Safe, shout fans at Dodger Stadium who see replays on the board. 
Umpires go to their headsets for a video review, and nearly three minutes later, the signal comes: Out! 
Want to hear exactly how disputed calls get decided, like that one in last year's NL Championship Series? 
Soon, we might. 
While nothing is set, Major League Baseball and umps are expected to discuss a plan — most prominently used in the NFL — for crew chiefs to wear a microphone and explain replay rulings. 
Under one possible scenario, they would start at the All-Star Game on July 11 in Miami, tweak the process over the season's second half and then go forward with the experiment in the playoffs. 
People familiar with the talks spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because an agreement has not yet been reached. 
Last year, MLB asked for the plate ump to wear a mic at the All-Star Game, but there wasn't enough time to do it. 
The umpires are in the middle of their five-year labor deal and any change would involve negotiations, plus a comfort level on both sides that the system would be efficient, accurate and easy. 
So no way to say for sure if fans at Camden Yards, Coors Field and ballparks across the majors will become familiar with the voices of veteran crew chiefs — be it country singer Joe West, ordained minister Ted Barrett or Dale Scott, once a Top 40 AM radio disc jockey. 
""It probably would be nice to get a little more explanation,"" Marlins reliever Brad Ziegler said. ""They're supposed to say the call stands or the call's confirmed. 'The call stands' means you can't tell. A lot of times we don't get that ... they just signal out or safe. That's all we get on the field. 
""They may announce it on the PA, but it doesn't seem like that is consistent in all parks. And the acoustics in the stadium here — we have a hard time hearing what's on the PA in the bullpen,"" he said. 
In the NFL, hearing refs announce ""upon further review"" has long been part of the lexicon. The lore includes what Ben Dreith said in a 1986 game, when Jets lineman Marty Lyons tangled with Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly and was penalized for ""giving him the business down there."" 
The NHL for some time has mic'ed up officials to explain coach's challenges, based on what the central replay booth tells them. 
NBA crew chiefs put on headsets to watch reviews and talk with the replay center. Decisions are explained to the official scorer's table and the benches, and the public address announcers inform the crowd. 
MLB has tried to speed up reviews this year, aiming for the umpires in the New York replay booth to relay the final calls to the field in under 2 minutes. 
""It'll take more time,"" Boston pitcher David Price said. ""It's not going to make them any shorter."" 
As for making the replay system more informative and entertaining, ""Yeah, until they have a problem with the umpire's mic,"" he said. 
Marlins star Christian Yelich said a switch wouldn't affect him. 
""The call's the call,"" he said. ""Just because they tell you what they decided isn't going to change it.""

The Slope Rules 
by Melanie Hooyenga 
Genre: YA Sports Romance 
Release Date: February 24th 2017 
Summary from Goodreads: 
Fifteen-year old Cally accepted her fate as one of the guys, so when she meets Blake, a hot snowboarder who sees her for more than her aerials on the slopes, she falls fast and hard. But their romance can only last as long as vacation.
Or so she thinks.
A twist of fate—well, her Dad opening another brewery in a new town—lands her in Blake’s school, but the charismatic boy she fell for wants nothing to do with her, and worse, the Snow Bunnies, the popular clique, claim her as their newest recruit.
Cally must learn to be true to herself—all while landing a spot on the ski team and figuring out who she is without her old friends. And when she finds out what Blake is hiding, she learns the rules on the slopes apply to more than just skiing.

EXCERPT: 
I double check that Blake is still in line for hot chocolate, then whip out my phone and fire off a text to Sophia. Found a hottie. Made contact. 
My good knee bounces in time to my heart, which hasn’t settled since Blake deposited me in a chair near the fireplace and pulled off his helmet, revealing shaggy brown hair that falls just above his crazy-blue eyes. The image in my head of us sipping hot chocolate next to the fire is beyond corny, but who am I to argue when they were the only open chairs.
My phone vibrates. Spill. 
Major wipeout. He came to my rescue. Carried me into the lodge. 
I check his progress in line and shake my head. What universe have I landed in where the hottest guy here—and the nicest, and not to mention a kickass boarder—is trying to impress me? It’s not like I’m not interested in boys, but I’ve always been so focused on skiing that by middle school I wedged myself in as one of the guys and now it’s too late to change it. The few dates I’ve been on were with boys outside my circle and they always get scared off once they meet my pack of friends and see how protective they are of me.
And you’re having his babies when? 
I snort just as Blake sits in the chair next to me. “Was it something I said?”
“Sorry! It’s my friend. She’s a little… never mind.” I tuck my phone into my coat pocket and take a Styrofoam cup from him. Our fingers graze and a little zing of electricity rockets up my arm and straight into my belly. I clear my throat, hoping he doesn’t notice that I can’t seem to speak.
He sets a bag of ice on the table, slides another chair close to me so I can prop up my leg, and sits in the chair next to me. I grab the bag and roll the ice around to break up any chunks, then plop it on my knee. I should really pull up my snowpants for the ice to help, but the bunny long underwear is staying in hibernation.
Once he’s sure I’m situated, he leans forward so his elbows are on the table and points one finger like he’s counting. “So here’s what I know. You’re one of the best trick skiers I’ve ever seen.” He points a second finger. “You’re here with your dad and…?” His head tilts as he waits for me to reply.
“Just my dad.”
He points the third finger. “And you’re gorgeous. Now this would be enough for your average snowboarding fool, but I want to know more.”
Who talks like that? I look around, expecting people to be staring, but no one’s paying attention to us. “Am I being punked?”
He furrows his brows. “What?”
“I’ve never once had anyone say something like that to me. I figure it must be a joke.”
A blush creeps up his cheeks and he pushes his hair off his forehead. “No joke. I had a lot of time to think when you were with the ski patrol dude. But I mean it. The girls at my school are too worried about their hair to put on a helmet and pull the flip you did.”
I shrug. “I guess I don’t worry about those things.”
He smiles and my belly does another somersault. “And that’s why I want to know more about you. Where are you from?”
I take a deep breath and force myself to relax. While I don’t want to fall into the friend zone with Blake, I know how to talk to guys. Pretend he’s Hunter or Sam. “I’m from Vermont. South Burlington. I’m on the ski team and wasn’t supposed to try that last trick without my coach, but the powder here is so different from back home I couldn’t resist.” I glance out the window in the direction of the scene of my crash and smile. “He’ll be happy you forced me onto the sled.”
His dimple deepens. “Right place, right time. So this is your first time in Colorado?”
I nod. “What about you?”
His smile hardens for a millisecond, but it’s back so fast I wonder if I imagined it. “I’m from Lake Tahoe. The California side.”
“Ooh, a Cali boy?”
He rolls his eyes. “We’re not all bad.”
“No, I’m intrigued. Us east coast girls don’t have too many run-ins with surfer boys.”
He bites his lower lip. “I don’t surf. I live in the mountains.”
“Oh, I figured you’re such a good snow boarder that you must surf in the summer.” He’s quiet, and I scramble for a new topic. I don’t know what made him clam up, but I can’t blow this in the first five minutes. “How long are you here for?”
The tension in his shoulders relaxes and he leans back in his chair. “‘Til Sunday.”
“Me too.” I can’t stop the goofy smile that plasters itself to my face. I met this boy less than an hour ago and I’m acting like we’re already in love. Which makes my cheeks flame even hotter.

Hugo Castro, a U.S. citizen and immigrant rights activist from San Diego, disappeared Thursday evening after posting a Facebook Live video from the shoulder of a highway near Mexico City, saying a group of criminals was ""hunting"" him. 
""Seriously, I was threatened, they want to kill me,"" he said in Spanish, asking for someone to pick him up, describing his location as Kilometer 37 of the highway to Puebla out of the Mexican capital. title=""Hugo Castro Facebook Liver"">Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.

Castro is a volunteer coordinator at Border Angels, a San Diego-based advocacy group. KPBS aired a story on Monday that followed Castro as he delivered donations to migrant shelters in Tijuana. 
His disappearance came as he was en route to participate in a caravan that is following asylum seekers from Central America on their dangerous trek to the U.S.-Mexico border. Hugo Castro's family is searching for him since Thursday. 
The caravan is meant to raise awareness about allegations that the U.S. has been turning away refugees without reviewing their cases, as well as human rights abuses they reportedly suffer in Mexico. 
Castro said in his Facebook live video, posted at 6:28 p.m. on Thursday, that a criminal organization had been following him for days and that they were now cornering him on the highway in freight vehicles. 
He pointed the camera at an area of the highway where he said the freight vehicles were pulling over and watching him. The video is unclear but the tail lights of a vehicle are visible on the shoulder. 
Castro, who appeared distressed, said he was almost out of money and that his phone's battery would soon die. 
He added that the criminal organization that he believed was following him was from Tamaulipas and that he suspected the government was involved. 
""I can't trust the police,"" he said.

The trend of searching the Internet for online reviews started about ten years ago and initially evolved almost exclusively around bars and restaurants. 
NEW YORK, NY – April 16, 2017 /MarketersMedia/ — 
Review monitoring and brand repair industry authority Help-My-Reviews.com, a company that has formed successful Internet reputations of many organizations and individuals since its inception in 1996, is demonstrating its excellence in the digital market at the ad:tech conference and exhibition events. Recognizing the importance of online customer reviews and the impact those reviews have on businesses’ revenue, Help-My-Reviews.com has developed a strategy that increases online star ratings as well as the reputation of a business. 
The trend of searching the Internet for online reviews started about ten years ago and initially evolved almost exclusively around bars and restaurants. Today, consumers write and read about a wide array of categories from Beauty & Spas to Automotive to Doctors to Shopping. No matter the category, people depend on the Internet for research on first time purchases and services. 
Based on statistics, 95% of customers are happy with the products or services they receive from a business, while the remaining 5% are not. Unhappy customers are 40 times more likely to go online to vent, resulting in negative reviews on major platforms. The main page of Help-My-Reviews.com’s newly redesigned website hosts a short video that explains the process of how review and reputation management can change your business’ online ranking. Their strategy is simple: Once a customer is serviced by a business, they get an email asking to rate their experience from one to five stars. If their rating is one, two, or three stars, Help-My-Reviews.com will inform the business contact only. If the rating is four or five stars, it will be posted online immediately. Help-My-Reviews.com help businesses get reviews and guarantees only 4 and 5 star ratings, no matter the industry. 
With locations in New York City and Washington, D.C., Help-My-Reviews.com serves companies across the United States. The leading review monitoring and management company is a regular attendee at ad:tech conferences and supports a number of other major marketing events, including Affiliate Summit, Leadscon, and SES.

On October 8, Alex Jones delivers a message to Donald Trump from above the Pennybacker Bridge in West Austin, saying Trump needed to viciously attack Hillary Clinton at the second presidential debate the next night or get out of the race. 
Posted: 1:50 p.m. Sunday, April 16, 2017 Highlights Alex Jones and his ex-wife, Kelly, will be locked in a child custody trial the next two weeks in Austin. Alex Jones’ lawyers will make the case that their client should not be judged by his on-air persona. Lawyers for Kelly Jones will maintain that Jones’ public outbursts suggest he is not a fit parent. 
At a recent pretrial hearing, attorney Randall Wilhite told state District Judge Orlinda Naranjo that using his client Alex Jones’ on-air Infowars persona to evaluate Alex Jones as a father would be like judging Jack Nicholson in a custody dispute based on his performance as the Joker in “Batman.” 
“He’s playing a character,” Wilhite said of Jones. “He is a performance artist.” 
But in emotional testimony at the hearing, Kelly Jones, who is seeking to gain sole or joint custody of her three children with Alex Jones, portrayed the volcanic public figure as the real Alex Jones. 
“He’s not a stable person,” she said of the man with whom her 14-year-old son and 9- and 12-year-old daughters have lived since her 2015 divorce. “He says he wants to break Alec Baldwin’s neck. He wants J-Lo to get raped. 
“I’m concerned that he is engaged in felonious behavior, threatening a member of Congress,” she said, referring to his recent comments about California Democrat Adam Schiff. “He broadcasts from home. The children are there, watching him broadcast.” 
?THE LATEST: Jury selected after long first day of Alex Jones trial 
Beginning Monday, a jury will be selected at the Travis County Courthouse that in the next two weeks will be asked to sort out whether there is a difference between the public and private Alex Jones, and whether, when it comes to his fitness as a parent, it matters. 
For Naranjo, who has been the presiding judge of the 419th District Court since January 2006, it is about keeping her eyes, and the jury’s eyes, on the children. 
“This case is not about Infowars, and I don’t want it to be about Infowars,” Naranjo told the top-shelf legal talent enlisted in Jones v. Jones at the last pretrial hearing Wednesday. “I am in control of this court, not your clients.” 
But for Alex Jones, at the peak of his power and influence, what emerges from the art deco courthouse on Guadalupe Street might shape whether he comes to be seen by his faithful as more prophet or showman. 
Infowars as evidence 
Alex Jones is an Austin original who, 21 years after he got his own show on Austin public access television, has become an unlikely popular and political force in the Donald Trump era, an ingenious and indefatigable conjurer of conspiracy theories about sinister global elites seeking to enslave the masses, who found, in Trump, a hero open to his shadowy narratives. 
“Alex Jones and his Infowars’ umbrella of radio shows, YouTube and Facebook broadcasts, Internet website and tweets turned out to be Trump’s secret weapon,” Roger Stone, probably Trump’s oldest and closest political confidant, wrote in his book “The Making of the President 2016.”“His fiery words have struck a chord in the nation and he speaks for millions. In fact, more people follow Alex than watch Fox News or CNN.” 
In addition to broadcasting his radio show on some 150 stations, Infowars.com had 7.6 million global unique visitors between March 16 and April 14 according to Quantcast, which measures web audiences and ranked Infowars.com 387th among all U.S. websites, not far behind Texas.gov, MLB.com and PBS.org. 
The Alex Jones YouTube channel has more than 2 million subscribers and more than 1.2 billion video views. 
But Jones’ most important listener is the president of the United States. 
During the campaign and into his presidency, many of Trump’s most defining themes and questionable assertions either originated with or were popularized by Infowars: Hillary Clinton for prison. Hillary Clinton is gravely ill. Bill Clinton is a rapist. President Barack Obama founded ISIS. The election is rigged. Millions of immigrants voted illegally. The news media covers up terrorist attacks. The “fake news media … is the enemy of the people.” Obama spied on Trump. 
In December 2015, thanks to Stone, Trump appeared via Skype on Jones’ show. 
“Your reputation is amazing,” Trump told Jones. “I will not let you down.” 
Since Trump became president, Jones has purported on air to be in regular direct telephone contact with the president, apologizing for not always being able to answer the phone when the president calls. Last week, Jones said that the president had invited him to Mar-a-Lago but that he had to beg off because of family obligations. 
Recently, Jones faulted Trump for falling for the “false flag” that it was the Syrian government, and not its enemies, that deployed chemical weapons against civilians, but he says he understands the political expedience involved and remains hopeful that Trump will reclaim the anti-globalist mantle.

Naranjo, meanwhile, said she had never seen or heard Jones on Infowars until Wednesday’s hearing, when Kelly Jones’ legal team started previewing Infowars videos it would like to play for the jury. 
The first was a clip from a July 2015 broadcast in which Jones had his son, then 12, on to play the latest of some 15 or 20 videos he had made with the help of members of the Infowars team who, Jones said, had “taken him under their wing” during summer days spent at the South Austin studio between stints at tennis and Christian camps. 
“He is undoubtedly cut out for this, and I intend for him to eclipse what I’ve done. He’s a way greater person than I was at 12,” said Jones, turning to his son. “I love you so much, and I didn’t mean to get you up here, sweetheart, and tell people how much I love you, but you’re so handsome, and you’re a good little knight who’s going to grow up, I know, to be a great fighter against the enemy.” 
“So far this looks like good stuff,” Wilhite said. Naranjo OK’d it for viewing by the jury. 
But Bobby Newman, the attorney for Kelly Jones guiding the court through the Infowars clips, was laying the groundwork for the argument that there is no separation between Alex Jones, father, and Alex Jones, Infowarrior. 
“This is the world he has planned for his kids,” said Newman, quoting Alex Jones at a recent hearing insisting that what he says on the air is what he believes. 
?SOCIAL MEDIA REACTS: What people are saying about Alex Jones 
Next up was a video of a recent conversation between Jones and Stone on Infowars that quickly escalated into an expletive-studded, gay-bashing rant by Jones directed at Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee investigation of Trump’s Russia ties, in which, Schiff has suggested, Stone and Jones might be entangled. 
Jones’ rant ends: “You got that, you goddamn son of a bitch? Fill your hand,” echoing John Wayne’s warning in True Grit” to a man he’s about to shoot and kill. 
“This is nothing but a response to a congressman who called him a Russian spy,” said David Minton, another lawyer representing Alex Jones. 
“What possible relevance does that have?” Minton asked. “They want to throw the stench in the jury box and never get the stench out. It has nothing to do with parenting.” 
A few days after his Schiff riff, Jones characterized it on-air as “clearly tongue-in-cheek and basically art performance, as I do in my rants, which I admit I do, as a form of art.” 
“When I say, ‘I’m going to kick your ass,’ it’s the Infowar,” Jones said. “I say every day we’re going to destroy you with the truth.” 
Jones’ rhetoric is perpetually at a pugilistic fever pitch.

Back in March, after Baldwin, playing Trump on “Saturday Night Live,” said he got his information on aliens from Alex Jones, Jones challenged Baldwin to a million-dollar charity bout —“I’ll get in the ring with you, and I will break your jaw, I will knock your teeth out, I will break your nose, and I will break your neck.” 
When, just after the election, Jennifer Lopez lamented about Trump at the Grammys, Jones responded that Trump “doesn’t want to bring people in from Somalia where women are sold on slave blocks. Why don’t you go to Somalia for five minutes, lady; you’ll be gang-raped so fast it’ll make your head spin.” 
Naranjo said she wouldn’t allow the jury to hear the Schiff diatribe, but she allowed two other clips, including one showing Alex Jones smoking marijuana in California, where it is legal. Naranjo didn’t review the Baldwin and Lopez clips, and it’s not clear whether Kelly Jones’ attorneys will seek to include them in the trial. 
Big legal bills 
Every record in the Jones case has been under seal since the divorce proceeding was initiated in Hays County in 2013. In January, the court denied Kelly Jones’ motion to unseal the record, granting a motion by Alex Jones — or simply A.J., as he is known in all the court filings — to keep them sealed 
For good measure, Naranjo said last week she was placing a gag order on all the litigants. 
At the previous pretrial hearing, on April 7, Naranjo ruled against Kelly Jones and her lawyers on a couple of key motions. 
Earlier this year, her lawyers had moved to add to the trial a $7 million emotional distress tort claim against Alex Jones. 
His lawyers said it was too late to prepare a defense against a new claim with 172 separate allegations. Naranjo agreed and promised to expedite a second trail on the tort claim. 
“They’d like to drag it out for two years, and she’ll be crushed and she’ll be bankrupt,” said Robert Hoffman, the Houston attorney who is Kelly Jones’ lead counsel, in arguing for rolling the tort claim into the trial. 
“She already is, for all practical purposes,” said Hoffman, who said she owed his firm $200,000, about all she had in the bank. 
Her attorneys also filed a motion to require Alex Jones to help pay her interim legal fees to better enable her to rescue her children from his clutches. 
“I don’t think there’s another case in Travis County with three children whose welfare hangs in the balance like this, except maybe a (Child Protective Services) case,” Hoffman said. 
“This is a wonderful mother who has had her kids turned against her,” Hoffman said. 
Wilhite said the crux of Kelly Jones’ problem is that she has gone through one set of lawyers after another and some $3.5 million since her divorce settlement, much of it pursuing fruitless motion after motion that actually cost her access to her children each step of the way. 
And she already receives $43,000 a month from her ex-husband. 
Naranjo rejected the motion that Alex Jones should have to contribute more, noting that the average Travis County juror won’t understand why Kelly Jones’ monthly stipend is not enough to cover her legal bills. 
“It is not within the realm of experience of their lives,” Naranjo said. 
”They are not going to believe the amount of money that has been spent on this,” the judge said. 
“This case is not about Infowars,” Naranjo said. “But, for some reason, this family has done very well. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be five lawyers on one side of the table and three over here, because of the business this family is in.” 
Meanwhile, Alex Jones has remarried, and his new wife is expecting a child, who, his lawyers said, might arrive during the trial. About the Author

The time has come to make a site report as strange things are happening.  Russian readers are now often half our readership; occasionally more! One day they were 90% of it and put our numbers through the roof!  I am expecting to see two guys in suits, brown shoes, wearing hats, pull into my driveway in a four door Plymouth, flash FBI ID and one asks a lot of questions while the other man watches silently.  I am familiar with these guys as I have been through this several times having published and programmed a few things they wanted to know about. 
I have no idea why Russians are interested in this blog, but they are. I will not speculate on their reasoning, but the last time it happened I could understand it as I had done a captioned filmstrip series that was very popular with their chemistry teachers.  My language was terse and all in chemistry context so they could read it, much as we can both read German chemistry text. 
The Russian government had bought one set for which my royalty was about $20, and made 25,000 copies for all their secondary schools in violation of the copyright, but they do not believe in them. Their teachers liked my films, wrote complimentary letters to me through Britannica and I responded to every one at a significant loss, but felt I was doing something good internationally. 
Meanwhile I was recently notified Facebook had closed my account, ""...for security reasons.""  I am sure it was because I have been using it to promote my ""CO 2 Is Innocent"" paper that features the demo-experiment showing CO 2 does not heat the atmosphere in any concentration.  We increase it 500 parts per million, ppm, per step in the demo and as we near 10,000 ppm the temperature declines!  This is per the Le Chatelier Principle which Dr. James Means, a hired ""denier assassin"" claims has nothing to do with it.  It is highly likely he complained to FaceBook.  So I'll pick up some other social venue as there are about 100.  Given the time Jim spends stalking me I am probably his only income source. (note: Yesterday Facebook put me back on line, I am hoping after a rasher of complaints.) 
If I had access to a professional educator's materials library I would not be surprised to see Le Chatelier, as applied to gases, has been removed from all physics teaching texts so deep is this scam.  Dr. Means is surely aware of that fact as the ink is still drying on his Ph.D. sheepskin.  This man jumps on me like a possum on a June bug wherever I publish and you can see examples of his attacks on the reviews of ""Vapor Tiger"" at Amazon.com or in the Comments section for ""CO 2 Is Innocent"" at http://ScienceFrauds.blogspot.com where he appears undercover as ""Anonymous.""  I recognize him as his language has a particular style, as do all people.  If I have seen three pieces by anyone I will recognize their writing. 
The anthropogenic global warming scam is dying and I can see all the signs like a bull in the ""muleta,"" small cape, final phase in the bull ring.  The promoters mistakes are becoming more obvious as they continue to tell them and that we are clearly in a cooling cycle is becoming more apparent.  However, I fear for the outcome as my campaign to put my demo in front of 548 men and women with physical science and engineering credentials on LinkedIn produced only one positive response, a ""thumbs up"" figure, and five angry ones accusing me of everything from being a ""Russian"" to insane, but none claimed the demo did not work.   
A few challenged me with Hansen quotes about ""forcing"" and ""feedbacks.""  My responses that ""forcing"" would require tiny pilots or Divine Intervention and ""feedbacks"" would make a perpetual motion machine possible were not responded to. 
I am not sure these people believe the nonsense of a one-way molecular shield at 60,000 to 100,000 feet where molecules are so few and far between.  Molecules have to be in contact, as in a solid or liquid to form a reflective surface.  If such a shield were at 100,000 feet the sky would be black as no sunlight could pass through unless this thing is a one-way window which would be a first in physical science.  And, an elaborate explanation would be required. 
Do we have two generations of ignorant scientists and engineers or are they all dishonest?  Either way is a great tragedy for America and the world and I am not sure how it will be resolved.  I am afraid we are looking at something completely without precedent in the history of America if not man.

WASHINGTON (AP) — How often do students miss school? Are they ready for college? Are they physically fit? Is their school a welcoming place? 
States are beginning to outline new ways to evaluate their schools, rather than relying just on traditional measures such as test scores. 
The plans are required under a new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, which takes effect in the coming school year. 
Under the new law, states are focusing more on academic growth, meaning not just whether students have achieved a certain academic level in reading and math, but whether they have improved over time. 
Mike Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, said that's a big change from the No Child Left Behind Act, the previous version of the education law. ""Schools and educators should feel good about that; that will be a fairer way to measure school quality,"" he said. 
But while most experts praised the flexibility and innovation offered by the new law, some think that in the absence of federal guidelines some states may overlook groups of students who need additional support, such as minorities, students with disabilities and English-language learners. The Republican-controlled Congress moved swiftly this year to rescind key federal accountability guidelines passed by the Obama administration to help states implement the new law. 
So far, nine states and the District of Columbia have submitted their accountability plans to the Education Department for review, and seven states are completing their blueprints. The remaining states will submit their plans in September. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will decide whether to accept or reject them. She has said her goal is state and local flexibility in education and indicated that she might use the process to advance school choice. 
When evaluating school quality, states are experimenting with new indicators. Almost all of the first-round states have adopted chronic absenteeism, or how many students miss more than 10 percent of the school year, as a key metric. 
Connecticut and Delaware, among others, also will be tracking college readiness, or whether high school students are taking advanced classes and how successful they are on college admission tests like the SAT. 
Tennessee wants to give every public school in the state a grade from A to F, which state Education Commissioner Candice McQueen says would give parents better information about schools. The grade will take into account such things as how well English language learners are doing and whether disabled students are being served. The schools will also be graded on chronic absenteeism rates, and if students are ready for college or the military and whether traditionally underserved students are performing well. Graduation rates also will count. 
Nevada outlined a system that focuses on student growth measures, including test scores, English language proficiency, and graduation rates. Massachusetts will be paying attention to academic results in ninth grade. 
In New Mexico, the state will begin tracking the need for additional tutoring in college and linking those back to high schools where the students studied. The state also will look at how students do in science in ranking schools. 
Some states are getting creative. Vermont and Connecticut want to make physical fitness another sign of school quality, while Connecticut also believes access to arts education should be another measure. Illinois wants to conduct ""climate surveys"" asking whether children feel they are in a safe and welcoming environment. 
""There is a lot more than just tests that matter for student success,"" said Natasha Ushomirsky with the Education Trust. ""Tests are important and looking at progress is important, but states are getting a better picture of how schools are serving students."" 
Another common thread that has emerged from the first round: States are doing a better job of involving parents, teachers and community activists in the process. ""They've been very proactive to engage anybody who has an interest in the plans,"" said Kirsten Carr with the Council of Chief State School Officers. 
But Marc Magee, CEO of 50Can, an education nonprofit, expressed concern that ""if everybody doesn't hold up their end of the bargain, we could go back to that era where certain populations of students become invisible inside schools even if they are struggling mightily and not getting the opportunity that they deserve."" 
And Lindsey Tepe, senior education policy analyst at New America, said there is so much variation in how states want to evaluate their schools that national comparisons could be difficult. ""Without the guidance, there isn't really a recipe to follow,"" said Tepe.

0,Pak Deh (noreply@blogger.com),2017-04-16T10:19:06.000+03:00,[],,,english,0,2017-04-16T10:19:06.000+03:00,,"  Opening Cambodia Life Insurance At the Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital in central Phnom Penh, Cheum Sor, 61, is lying on the hospital floor with an intravenous drip attached to his arm. The gloomy, crowded ward does not have any air conditioning or even a nurse call button. His wife, Chan Theng, 54, sits beside him the whole day to fan him and summon the nurse if something goes wrong. The couple gave up their job as contract farmers, where they had earned $3 a day, to come to this public hospital from Kandal Province next to the capital, when Cheum Sor developed high blood pressure. Having been designated ""poor,"" he can receive medical treatments here for free. But expenses for travel, food and special medicine have eaten up most of the 1 million riel ($250) the couple had brought with them -- from their savings and by taking out high-interest loans from a local pawn shop. They have no insurance to cover such expenses or compensate them for their period of unemployment. ""What is insurance?"" Chang Theng asked. Insurance magnet With one of the most underinsured populations in Asia, as well as an economy growing at 7% a year, Cambodia has become a magnet for both life and non-life insurers. Currently, there are seven non-life and six life insurance players in the market. AIA, Asia's largest life insurer, was the latest to join the pack following a license approval last month. ""We have a big cake and many people want a piece,"" Huy Vatharo, chairman of the Insurance Association of Cambodia, told the Nikkei Asian Review . ""But we have a challenge in making people understand the necessity and benefits of insurance."" According to the IAC, the market, which is less than two decades old, continues to show remarkable growth. Premiums of non-life insurances, which were first launched in the early 2000s, have increased an average 19% in the past five years. For life insurance, which was introduced in 2012, premiums doubled last year. However, tackling hurdles like low public awareness, low income levels and an immature capital market, is no easy task. The ratio of premium to gross domestic product was less than 0.5% in 2015, according to the IAC. In comparison, developed nations like Japan and the U.S. boast penetration rates of 10.8% and 7.3%, respectively. Even Southeast Asian peers such as Vietnam (1.6%) and Indonesia (1.7%) have higher penetration. The country's complex history of years of repression and failed politics makes it difficult to encourage people to pay for something that may or may not occur in the long term. ""People here tend to live for tomorrow, not for the distant future,"" said Tondy Suradiredja, chief executive of Cambodia Life Insurance, the country's first life insurer. ""They think: Why do I have to think about my retirement if I am not sure what is going to happen with the government?"" An Indonesian native, Suradiredja has been in the Cambodian insurance industry since Cambodia Life, a former state-owned company, started business in 2012. Moreover, income levels are still low. Cambodia has the lowest per capita GDP in Southeast Asia. Nominal monthly wages were 642,000 riel ($160) in 2014, according to the International Labor Organization. $1.2 daily premium The market's early birds are trying out various tactics to reach out to potential core customers. Cambodia Life will start, in May, selling low-premium insurance, what can be categorized as micro insurance, at the 3,700 plus agents of Wing (Cambodia), the country's leading mobile payments provider. Two packages providing coverage of $5,000 and $10,000 will be rolled out. Premiums can be paid on either a daily or monthly basis. ""It's just $1.2 a day -- cheaper than a parking ticket,"" Suradiredja said. ""That's how we make a difference."" Meanwhile, Manulife Cambodia, the local arm of Canadian life insurance giant Manulife, has been launching various marketing campaigns to simply raise the public's awareness since it started business in 2012. ""Cambodian people are still excited about advancing themselves, creating new businesses, finding better jobs and looking for new opportunities,"" Chief Executive Robert Elliott told the Nikkei Asian Review. ""Asking them to sit back and consider where they want to be in 20 years' time is a conversation most people have never had."" But Manulife is doing just that. It has been holding seminars across the nation to explain about life insurance and its role in people's lives. More than 75,000 have attended to date. ""At first nobody knew our name -- they thought we were a football team,"" Elliott recalls. Now, the company has 300,000 followers on Facebook. Manulife's offerings in Cambodia are mostly endowment policies, savings products that pay out a lump sum at the end of a certain period. ""The saving element is very important because that allows people to plan,"" Elliott said. In fact, according to the IAC's Vatharo, more than 95% of the life insurance policies sold in the market are endowment products. Increasingly popular are education policies that allow the customer to save and pay out when the policy holder's child reaches a certain education stage. If the customer prematurely dies, a lump sum is paid anyway. Soth Visal, a 33-year-old manager at a website operating company, recently bought an education insurance policy for his seven-year-old son from the local arm of U.K.-based Prudential. Out of his annual income of $12,000, Visal pays $243 in annual premiums. The policy will pay out $6,000 when the child reaches 18 years old, even if Visal prematurely dies. ""It's not much, considering that if I die, my wife won't have to worry about our child's education,"" he said. ""It's better than saving in a bank because we can't withdraw the money until the right time comes."" Premiums in bank deposits But a growing market means that insurers will have to find long-term investment destinations to grow their assets. Currently, Cambodia has no bond market. Its stock market is still in its early days, with only four companies listed. However, the government requires insurance companies to invest 75% of their premiums within Cambodia. Most of the insurance companies invest in bank deposits. ""The interest rate is 4.25% on average,"" said Cambodia Life's Suradiredja. ""And sometimes you can get 6-7% if you put it into microfinance."" Manulife also deposits 75% of its premiums with local banks, but leaves the remaining 25% with its reinsurance group company in Hong Kong. Elliott is willing to invest in infrastructure projects too, as soon as there is an instrument to do so. Despite the challenges, the companies are confident the outlook is bright. One good sign is that more and more foreign hospital operators are entering the country to provide high-quality, but expensive, health care. ""People may find out that the cost of medical is high if they want to get better treatment,"" IAC's Vatharo said. ""So how do they pay for that? Insurance is probably the answer.""

Such an exhaustive legwork will enable you to settle on a cleaning specialist who can offer good services in your area of residence. For a qualified commercial cleaning services Indianapolis IN residents can search locally or online.

In order to settle on a suitable service provider in your state, it is worthwhile to interrogate several of them.

Explained in this exhaustive piece are the most crucial factors to consider when choosing a qualified commercial cleaning service in Indianapolis IN.

To commence with, recommendations from people that you know can be resourceful. Your close relatives and trustworthy friends can recommend you the cleaning companies they have relied upon in the past. Consider asking for recommendations that can assist you in getting a suitable cleaner in your state.

Secondly, in the event where recommendations from other people are not forthcoming, do not hesitate to look for these online. You simply need to have the relevant keywords that will guarantee you access to their websites. Once you get to their websites, look at the comments posted on review pages by their previous clients. Avoid companies with negative comments.

Thirdly, ask all your potential candidates to furnish you with a list of clients they have worked for previously.

Avoid dealing with inexperienced cleaners who do not have the slightest clue of what it takes to remain relevant in the industry.

Also, qualification is a crucial thing to look at before contracting any professional. A qualified person should have gone through proper training in order to acquire the necessary knowledge in this field. Ascertain that the person you go for is qualified. Ask the specialist to show you all the qualification papers so that you can check whether or not they are genuine.

To add on, it advisable to award the cleaning task to a licensed operator. By so doing, one is certain of hiring a service provider who is allowed by law to carry out cleaning services in your state. Remember that it is illegal to engage with a person who is not licensed. Check the licenses to make sure that they are valid and up to date.

Riddle crushes a walk-off two-run homer for his first career home run in the Majors, winning the game for the Marlins in the 9th inning By Joe Frisaro and Anthony DiComo / MLB.com | + 0 COMMENTS 
MIAMI -- After having a no-hit bid and a two-run lead disappear, the Marlins celebrated a 4-2 walk-off win on Sunday over the Mets when J.T. Riddle crushed a two-out, two-run homer in the ninth inning off Addison Reed . 
Riddle, who collected his first big league hit on a check swing single a few days ago, left no-doubt with his homer to right field. The blast came after the Marlins lost a replay challenge that Mets catcher Travis d'Arnaud blocked the plate, preventing Marcell Ozuna from scoring. Full Game Coverage 
""It's crazy,"" said Riddle, who was called up last Sunday after shortstop Adeiny Hechavarria went on the disabled list. ""It's funny how baseball works sometimes. My first hit is a check-swing bouncer off the ground, and then to come up in a situation like that. To do that, it's hard to explain."" 
In a wild four-game series, the Marlins rebounded after losing, 9-8, in 16 innings on Thursday night to take the next three. 
""It was an amazing feeling,"" Riddle said. ""Something you dream of as a kid, and then to be here, doing that to get a walk-off home run and a series win against the Mets."" Marlins carry no-hitter into 8th NYM@MIA: Marlins carry combined no-no into the 8th The Marlins carry a combined no-hitter into the 8th inning, headlined by Dan Straily's five K's over 5 1/3 strong frames in the team's win 
Marlins starter Dan Straily and the bullpen were trying to accomplish a franchise-first, which was a combined no-hitter. For 7 2/3 innings, they held New York without a hit before Neil Walker 's clean single to center off Brad Ziegler . 
""At the end of the day, it would have been really cool,"" Straily said of a combined no-hitter. ""Those don't come very often. But at the same time, we got the win, that was most important."" 
Miami carried a two-run lead into the ninth inning before the Mets rallied with two outs off David Phelps , who was getting the save chance because A.J. Ramos was unavailable. But with two outs, pinch-hitter Asdrubal Cabrera delivered a two-run single to center. Ozuna hangs onto wall for catch NYM@MIA: Ozuna hangs off the wall to make great grab Marcell Ozuna climbs the wall in left field and holds on to rob Wilmer Flores of extra bases in the top of the 5th inning 
Ozuna, who had an RBI double in the sixth inning, made a terrific catch at the wall in the fifth inning to rob Wilmer Flores of extra-bases. 
Mets right-hander Matt Harvey worked six innings, allowing two runs (one earned) on seven hits with five strikeouts. 
""This is a good baseball team,"" manager Terry Collins said. ""We have issues like everybody else, but we're trying to mesh a pitching staff we've got to be careful of and a bullpen we're going to be careful of. We're going to be OK."" Harvey K's Bour NYM@MIA: Harvey strikes out Bour swinging in the 2nd Matt Harvey strikes out Justin Bour swinging for his first K of the game in the bottom of the 2nd inning 
MOMENTS THAT MATTERED Garcia in relief: Straily may not have allowed any hits through 5 1/3 innings, but his pitch count was up to 93 after issuing one-out walks to Walker and Yoenis Cespedes . Miami went with rookie left-hander Jarlin Garcia to face left-handed hitting Jay Bruce and Lucas Duda . With Miami ahead by a run at the time, Bruce struck out and Duda lifted a lazy fly ball to left. Ozuna's RBI double NYM@MIA: Ozuna drives an RBI double to left field Marcell Ozuna rips a double into left that scores Christian Yelich, giving the Marlins a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the 6th inning 
Add-on run, but key out: The Marlins got a critical add-on run in the sixth inning when Ozuna laced an RBI double into the gap in left-center. Yelich scored from second, but Justin Bour was thrown out at the plate. Cespedes threw to Jose Reyes , whose relay to the plate got Bour. There was a little confusion on the play, as catcher Travis d'Arnaud applied the tag, while his leg prevented Bour from reaching home. The Marlins didn't challenge if d'Arnaud blocked the plate, and Bour was out. More > 
""I didn't think we had a shot,"" d'Arnaud said. ""But Jose's throw was right on the money. I just tried to apply the tag as quick as I could to be able to get him."" 
QUOTABLE ""This was a strange series -- a 16-inning game and then basically three walk-offs. Certainly some strange things happened really this entire road trip. But the good news is we came away from these two series with four wins and three losses. So we'll take the positives out of this."" --Walker, on the Mets' road trip. More > 
""This last week, I thought had it all. It's been a great first homestand, and a great first impression on me being down here, being new to Miami. It's been a lot of fun."" -- Straily, on a week in Miami that featured two walk-off wins, a 16-inning loss, a power-outage delay and a delay because a cat was in the outfield. Ozuna's liner hits Stanton NYM@MIA: Stanton hit by liner running to second base While trying to pull off a hit-and-run, Giancarlo Stanton is struck by Marcell Ozuna's screaming line drive in the 4th inning 
RUN AND BE HIT Falling into the category of ""you don't see that everyday,"" Ozuna lined a base hit in the fourth inning that left a mark on his teammate, Giancarlo Stanton . On the play, Stanton was on first and executing a hit-and-run play. Ozuna lined sharply, and the ball was headed towards right field, but instead, it deflected off Stanton, who tried to stride out of the way, but the ball found his left hip. The pitch from Harvey was clocked at 94.5 mph, and the exit velocity, according to Statcast™ , was 92 mph. 
By rule, Ozuna is credited with a single, but Stanton is ruled out. The putout went to the closest Mets defender, which was second baseman Walker. Mets nab Ozuna at home NYM@MIA: Mets cut down Ozuna at home, call confirmed Yoenis Cespedes and Asdrubal Cabrera team up to throw out Marcell Ozuna at home plate, and the call is confirmed after the Marlins challenge 
UPON FURTHER REVIEW The Marlins challenged that d'Arnaud blocked the plate, not giving Ozuna a chance to score on Miguel Rojas ' double to left in the ninth inning. Cespedes relayed to Cabrera who made a strong throw home. After a short review, Ozuna was ruled out. 
Mattingly accepted the fact that Ozuna was out, but he noted that the 30 seconds to make a decision to challenge or not is something he'd like more clarity on. 
""I think he was out,"" Mattingly said. ""So nothing got changed by it. But I do think it could have. It could have been one of those [decisions] you don't challenge because you ran out of time."" 
WHAT'S NEXT Mets: Following an off-day Monday, the Mets will return to Citi Field to begin a nine-game, 11-day homestand against the Phillies, Nationals and Braves. First up is a three-game set against Philadelphia, with Zack Wheeler opposing right-hander Zach Eflin in Tuesday's 7:10 p.m. ET opener. 
Marlins: The Marlins start a nine-game road trip, beginning on Monday night at 10:10 p.m. ET at Seattle. Tom Koehler (0-0, 3.27) gets the start for Miami, with lefty Ariel Miranda (0-1, 5.06) getting the nod for the Mariners. The series will feature the return of Miami outfielder Ichiro Suzuki to Safeco Field.

A curious collection of new meanings for old words. 




What's it all about ... 
There are all sorts of people, events and sounds that exist in the musical world for which there are no words. We have been sadly bereft of a satisfactory way to describe the contortion of a singer’s mouth when reaching for the high notes; the audience member who leaves a concert halfway through the grand finale; or that person who places one finger in their ear and raises their eyes heavenwards when they sing. 

What did I think about it... 

It's no secret that I love listening to Classic FM , particularly on a Sunday morning when I am preparing my blog posts for the week ahead. So, to have a new musical treasury is a real treat especially as it is written by Classic FM presenter, Tim Lihoreau. 
The Classic FM Musical Treasury is a feast for the senses, as not only does it have a delightfully humorous approach to musical facts, there is also the possibility of learning something you never knew you needed to know.  There should always be a word to describe what's happening in music but when that word doesn't exist, well as this book suggest, why not create one... 
The treasury is divided into ten sections and spans Performers and their Works, through to, my favourite section, Trivia and Treats. This treasury incorporates, with musical suggestions, to quote the author... ""the place names of towns and villages, the suburbs,  hamlets, digs, dens, the quarters and quoins of this beautiful land of ours…” 
I was especially heartened to see the name of a village a couple of miles away from Jaffareadstoo mentioned on the very first page. It made me smile and thus set the scene for the rest of this delightful treasury which had me nodding in agreement on more than one occasion and which sent me scurrying through the book to spot other place names I recognised. 
For classical music fans this book is definite smorgasbord of different musical meanings which stretch and fire the imagination. 
These are just a few of my favourite place names within this musical meandering… 
Jolly’s bottom (pg202) Trivia and Treats Steeple Bumstead (pg37) Performers and Performances Totley Rise (pg60) Concerts, Festivals and Tours And my absolute favourite is Buldoo (pg163) Composers and their Works …this definition made me laugh out loud... 
‘a faux Scottish work of light music purporting to ‘evoke the sights and sounds of the highlands’ (written ten years ago originally about farming and kept in a bottom drawer ready to be re-branded when the opportunity arose). 
And one for Jaffa… Cat’s Bank (pg8) Performers and Performances 
'names in a fixer's little black book that can be called on when a diva falls ill"" 
If you like random musical quirkiness with a hint of the absurd all melted together with British eccentricity then this book works really well. 

Best Read with... A Hamperley of Apperley Parva and a glass or two of Hartsop

The hearing – 6-9 p.m. May 9 at the Boys and Girls Club of the East Valley, Gila River Branch-Komatke, 5047 West Pecos Road, Laveen – won’t slow down construction, the Arizona Department of Transportation said in a release last week. “The project remains on track for completion in late 2019,” ADOT said, adding its “project team will move forward with other construction while the May 9 hearing is pending.” Any work occurring in a designated waterway that falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency requires a so-called Section 404 Clean Water Act permit. “Along the 22-mile South Mountain Freeway corridor, these areas, including the Salt River, various washes and a conveyance channel in Laveen, are being been roped off and identified by signs saying “Waters of the United States,’” ADOT said. The Gila River Indian Community early last year requested the hearing, which the Corps of Engineers has the discretion to hold. “ADOT has worked closely with stakeholders to plan a South Mountain Freeway that not only meets strict environmental standards but also addresses one of the most critical transportation needs in the Valley: an east-west alternative to Interstate 10 through downtown Phoenix,” the department said in a release, saying its 13-year analysis was “the most extensive environmental review of any highway project to date in Arizona.” That position is at the heart of the appeal by the Gila Community and Ahwatukee-based Protect Arizona’s Resources and Children, which is attempting to stop the freeway’s construction. They are asking the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to overturn a federal judge’s finding that ADOT and the Federal Highway Administration complied with all environmental regulations when the agencies planned the freeway. Meanwhile, ADOT and freeway developer Connect202Partners are continuing to field complaints from motorists and residents about overnight construction noise and the condition of the interim Pecos Road between 24th and 40th streets in Ahwatukee. “My experience was one of the most frightening driving situations ever,” one motorist wrote on social media about the road as he recounted how the glare of the rising morning sun blotted out lane markings and signs on the new road. “What you could see was the sun reflecting off the old tar lines from previous repair of Pecos,” he said. “Those lines appeared to look like the road was straight, but it wasn’t. The next thing I saw was a car coming straight at mine. Thankfully nothing happened, but it was close. ADOT needs to make a lane divider separating the two directions of traffic or there is bound to be a serious head-on.” ADOT has stated it and the freeway developer are continuing to upgrade signage and road striping along the makeshift interim roadway, and reduce long traffic jams on 40th Street and Pecos Road. 
“I completely agree that what happened on Pecos Road this past week is not safe and not conducive to allowing traffic to get through,” city Councilman Sal DiCiccio posted on Facebook Friday, adding that ADOT told him it had made some improvements last week and would be continuing this week.

Announces Appointment of Ryan Eller as President and Chief Operating Officer Acquisitions & Hotel Openings Developed and Owned by XSS Hotels and Managed by Colwen Hotels, Homewood Suites Boston Logan Airport Chelsea Opens Business & Finance Coming Up In The May Online Hotel Business Review Feature Focus Eco-Friendly Practices: The Value of Sustainability The hotel industry continues to make remarkable progress in implementing sustainability policies and procedures in their properties throughout the world. As a result, they continue to reap the benefits of increased profitability, enhanced guest experiences, and improved community relations. In addition, as industry standards are codified and adopted worldwide, hotels can now compare how their operations measure up against their competitors in terms of sustainable practices and accomplishments. This capacity to publicly compare and contrast is spurring competition and driving innovation as hotels do not wish to be left behind in this area. Water management and conservation is still a primary issue as population growth, urbanization, pollution and wasteful consumption patterns place increasing demands on freshwater supply. Water recycling; installing low-flow fixtures; using digital sensors to control water usage; and even harvesting rainwater are just a few things that some hotels are doing to preserve this precious resource. Waste management is another major concern. Through policies of reduce, reuse and recycle, some hotels are implementing ?zero-waste? programs with the goal of substantially reducing their landfill waste which produces carbon dioxide and methane gases. Other hotels have established comprehensive training programs that reinforce the value of sustainability. There is employee engagement through posters and quizzes, and even contests are held to increase innovation, sensitivity and environmental awareness. Some hotels are also monitoring a guest?s energy usage and rewarding those who consumed less energy with gifts and incentives. The May issue of the Hotel Business Review will document how some hotels are integrating eco-friendly practices into their operations and how they and the environment are benefiting from them. © 1996-2017.

Members pay €50 (£42) a month and get access to desks, free coffee, a nap room, and ping pong tables. A number of larger corporate partners, including Google and Deutsche Bank pay considerably more to access Factory's entrepreneurial community. 
Over a thousand people have signed up to be Factory members and a number of well known startups — including Uber and SoundCloud — have chosen to base themselves out of private Factory offices, either in the main Factory building or in nearby satellite properties that offer slightly more privacy.

One of the biggest issues is that it is up to the officer to decide if you notified "" promptly "". It is also up to them to decide if you notified properly . And, if they decide otherwise, you are arrested, jailed, charged with an M1 and loss of license. On top of that, many officers are unclear on the law and hassle people who are *not* required to notify because they are not carrying. We have story after story of people ending up in a bind over this - it is the single most frequent issue that licensees get hassled or arrested over.

This is not only about driving. This law currently applies any time you are stopped by a cop for a law enforcement purpose, even if walking on the sidewalk. Some cops have misunderstood this law to mean you have to notify when the cop strikes up a casual conversation with you at the grocery store while standing line.
Should this repeal pass, you still have to notify when asked. What this repeal does is remove the amiguity. If the cop wants to know, they ask, and you notify. That's it.

Over the next few days, that post received over 20,000 views.
Let’s dig a bit into what that post is about, the methodology behind it, and both the short- and long-term benefits. By the end, you’ll be able to take home some tips and ideas that you might leverage for a trending topic of your own.
A Brief Blog Post About Vine When I first started writing about social media news and information, I made it a point to subscribe to the blogs and press rooms of every major network. While not every newsworthy change or update is published there, many of the important developments are announced that way.
So late on a Thursday morning, I got a notification that Vine had published to their blog on Medium, a post cryptically titled, “ Important News about Vine. ” That’s how I came to find the stunning news that Twitter was shutting down Vine.
As I’ve mentioned before , every time you become aware of a piece of news that might potentially be interesting to your audience, you have to ask yourself these questions:
Is the news interesting and relevant to my audience (if not, ignore) Am I interested in writing about this news (if not, share the original source) Do I have time right now to write & publish an article (if not, share the original source) Often, sharing that blog post from Vine would be the way to go. But in this instance, I had positive answers for each of the questions.
My readers might be interested in Vine, and there’s a potential to reach far more Vine users that aren’t part of my existing audience. While I’m not an avid Vine user personally, I’ve written about Vine and have included Vine in my monitoring of social network active usage for years, so the topic is quite interesting and relevant to me. Time… that was going to be close. I had about 25 minutes to finish my lunch before a weekly noon meeting commenced, so I’d need to write, publish and get some initial promotion started within that amount of time. Piece of cake when it’s something you’ve done countless times.
Now, fortunately, shutting down of Vine wasn’t, in itself, a complicated topic. The post that I wrote simply needed to convey what was going on, when, what impact it would have on existing Vine users, and whatever Why could be gleaned from the original Vine blog post.
That took just 15 minutes to write – it didn’t have to be a massive article – plus a few minutes to create a graphic in Canva and then publish. “ What’s Happening To Vine? ”
Approaching Topics From Experience This is certainly an example of where experience matters a great deal.
First, earlier this year, I’d published an article about the imminent demise of Blab and titled it “ What Is Happening With Blab? ” – and that proved to be an excellent title format as many people were wondering exactly that. So I mimicked it for this new post on Vine.
Second, as with Blab and Posterous and other networks before Vine, I’ve written about the shuttering of social platforms and therefore understand what readers want to know. They want to know what’s going on, of course, and why it’s all happening. But most importantly and immediately, they need to understand how they’re impacted and what the can or should do.
When Posterous closed , for instance (a blogging platform Twitter bought in 2012 and shut down in 2013), users needed to understand how to save their content so that they might recreate their blog on another platform. Vine was the same way. Vine users now need to know how to save their vines as video files that they can then choose to upload to another platform.
They also need to know how to try and get their audience to move from Vine to their preferred (active) network.
So those were points I knew instinctively I needed to make in the article.
Third, this wasn’t a surprise to me. I’d written at the new year that I fully expected 2016 to be a year filled with attrition in the social network space as there were already too many networks with similar functionality and demographics.
Not only was I prepared to write an article like this, it was a point I could easily make within the article.
I mention all of this to help illustrate the point that newsjacking, like any skill, takes time and practice to improve. And there’s no doubt that my skill pales in comparison to top new journalists who are covering breaking news every day – I just do it when the topic suits my audience and I feel like taking the time.
For most of you, you’ll need some time to get this level, so don’t be discouraged if you need a few hours to write the post, or if your first few newsjacking attempts don’t go over as well as you’d like.
Keep at it!
Spreading The Word About Vine Closing The bulk of my motivation for writing about the topic in the first place was to make sure that as many people as possible heard about the news and, if it affected them, they’d have to prepare.
The fact is, if I publish content to my blog, I reach a far greater audience than if I simply share an article to my social channels. My blog content gets emailed, indexed in search, and shared by countless other readers and subscribers, resulting in tremendous spread.
So once I published the post, I shared it to all of my channels and it was automatically sent to my email subscribers.
Frankly, the initial interest was low – and in fact, days later the post still has less-than-average indications of social shares and interest.
I assumed that meant that my audience had very little interest in Vine… which was something I had figured from the start. It was the Vine community that I’d hoped to reach.
And boy, did I ever.
By Thursday evening, I began to notice a different kind of traffic coming in – Organic. Google had begun to rank my content among the top results for search terms like, “What’s Happening To Vine”.

Note that my article appeared just after a post by The New York Times and Vine’s own blog announcement.
Not too shabby!
So Thursday evening I spent a little more time optimizing the post.
I edited the Title to include “Twitter Is Shutting It Down.” I embedded a video from a Viner reacting to the news. I added a forwardlink from related past articles. I added a Click To Tweet with the hashtag #RIPVine I scheduled additional social shares. I added a little more context and information. On Thursday, the post got 1,943 views.
On Friday, the post got 8,704 views.
On Saturday, the post got 6,647 views.
On Sunday, the post got 2,757 views.
Nearly 92% of that traffic was via Google search.
These view counts also reflect the Google Trends graph for related terms over that period, which we’ll get into in a moment.
But it’s important to note not just the raw numbers but how they compare to the typical content that I publish. Because while I’ve had many successful articles, nearly every one has been a slow, gradual growth over time.
This one article accrued 20,051 views over a 4-day period but my normal articles see an average of 750 visitors during the first 30 days. That’s a 2500% increase in traffic! 
So of course, I want to keep riding that wave for as long as possible.

You can also see my site’s overall traffic for the two months leading up to the Vine Shutting Down article. 
That’s partly where this article fits in, to be frank. By referencing the Vine article and topics, I’m continuing to link to that post and use the keywords that people are searching. There will also be some people who read this article and who didn’t know about the first one, so this continues to raise awareness.
But I also used Google Trends, as I mentioned, to review where the topic was headed. I researched and compared a number of terms, looking for related keywords I might not have thought of, as well as any indications some might be trending up.

(Note that this is over Halloween weekend in the U.S. and therefore Monday might see renewed interest. It’s something I’ll continue to keep an eye on.)
The point here is that you can use Google Trends to watch hour-by-hour, day-by-day interest in a particular topic. While this may not help you determine whether to write about a topic, it might be a good indicator whether you should invest more time into optimizing and spreading a post you’ve just recently written. Or even publishing follow-up content! (I’ve seen some great articles that try to explore the Why behind the decision to close Vine, for instance.)
UPDATE 11/04 : While interest and traffic has continued to wane, numbers for Monday and Tuesday were still significant. The What’s Happening To Vine post saw 1,493 visitors on Monday, 1,219 on Tuesday, and over 500 as of midday on Wednesday. So while readership of the post will no doubt die down to a trickle very soon, this article and topic has had significantly more staying-power than most.
UPDATE 12/30 : Surprisingly, the Vine article has continued to perform well through the end of the year. This has been buoyed somewhat by the fact that Twitter announced a slight change in their stance on Vine. They said on 12/16 that instead of completely closing down Vine, Vine users would still be able to use the app to share photos and 6-second videos to Twitter. I updated the original article accordingly and within a few days, search engine traffic doubled from 250 a day to over 500 a day.
UPDATE 04/08 : Traffic to this one-time newsjacking article continues to hold strong! There was an update to the story in January as Twitter decided to let Vine users continue to use the Vine app as a camera, and that uploaded videos of 6 seconds or less would automatically loop like Vines, effectively giving long-time Viners an ongoing medium for their creative work. At the time, traffic to the post continued at a pace of about 250 visits per day. Then in March, that doubled and wen back up into the 400-500 visits per day, and has stayed that way into April. After 5+ months, the article has received over 75,000 pageviews , of which 93% has been referral traffic from organic Google search.
The Benefits of Newsjacking Some of the benefits are probably clear just from what I’ve already shared in this post, but let’s call them all out and differentiate between short-term and long-term. Even though this post is clearly just days old at the time this Case Study is published, I’ve written enough newsjacking posts in the past to be able to speak to their long-term benefits.
Short-Term Benefits of Newsjacking Traffic – potentially massive traffic Social Media Activity Authority Building Obviously not every article is going to get the kind of traffic this Vine post did – but it’s always a possibility! I would also be remiss not to note that sometimes even a newsjacking article will continue to rank well and gain traffic long-term – it just depends on the topic. I quick blog post I wrote in 2013 about an update to the Twitter app continues to rank to this day for users searching how to set up multiple Twitter accounts .
Conversely, most of my newsjacking articles get far more social media activity than this post did. That can usually be attributed to the topic and audience fit. Had I been writing about a Facebook change, it would have seen far greater reach and engagement on Facebook. Regardless, when you share a piece of news with your social networks, many of your followers will be eager to share it with their own audiences.
While traffic and social engagement can be measured, the last short-term benefit of newsjacking, Authority Building, cannot be so easily quantified. Yet, it’s there nonetheless. When you write about topics, particularly trending ones, you immediately position yourself as ‘in the know’ to your followers and potential followers. The significance of that authority cannot be overstated.
Long-Term Benefits of Newsjacking New Subscribers for ongoing email marketing. New Website Visitors for ongoing remarketing. Increased traffic and ranked content for long-term SEO benefits. Alexa Rank. Domain Authority. Backlinks. If your topic is on point – in other words, you gave Newsjacking Question #1 careful consideration and made sure that the news was both interesting and relevant to your readers – then it’s likely that readers of the article will be interested in subscribing to future email updates.
Similarly, if you’re using remarketing (or retargeting) to run Facebook or Google ads for people who have already visited your website, a smash hit like this Vine post really helps those campaigns by injecting significant levels of new visitors.
Now, a more subtle benefit could be long-term SEO improvement. Because you see, as long as your content is great – it answers the questions readers have – search engine traffic can beget search engine traffic. In other words, once Google begins to send more traffic to your site, and sees that those readers seem satisfied with that result, your content can be ranked higher and gain even more traffic.
And those results can lead to an increase in your website’s Alexa Rank (there’s no doubt that adding 20,000 visitors in a month is going to help mine), as well as domain authority. Depending on the topic and insight that you offer, you’ll often find other bloggers and writers linking to your content, creating valuable backlinks.
Those benefits can only be seen over time, so be sure to make a notation in your Google Analytics so that you can measure the impact a particular piece of content has on your traffic, referrals and goal completions.
What’s Next? In order to begin to see some of these benefits for yourself, you’re just going to have to start newsjacking. There’s no substitute for experience.
However, that doesn’t mean you have to be wholly unprepared. We’ve reviewed the major questions to ask, but what most people struggle with is making sure that they’re informed well enough in advance to be able to write a newsjacking piece.
If you’re hearing about a topic from mainstream news, it’s likely too late to write about it yourself and still catch that news cycle.

@lucywilliams02 
Sunday is often the most challenging day of the week. As some people say, anticipation can be worse than the real thing—which in this case is the week ahead. On Saturday, you’re all gung-ho about the weekend, but as the hours creep further and further into Sunday, you get a case of what’s been dubbed “ the Sunday scaries .” What do you have going on this coming week? Are you ready? How can you possibly make it through five whole days of work? 
What we really should be doing with those Sunday night hours is savoring them, not wishing them away. So you don’t have to waste any more precious time, we’ve rounded up the 37 best things to do on a Sunday night when you’re bored. Print out this list (or save it to your phone!) and cross activities off as you go. 
1. Give your hair a hot oil treatment. Put any olive oil you have in the house in a mug, heat it up for 60 seconds at a time in the microwave, and leave on your strands for 15 minutes. Shampoo out and your locks will thank you. 
2. Prep a frittata to have for breakfast all week long. We’re partial to this paleo breakfast casserole with its signature sweet potato crust. 
3. Join Emma Roberts’ new book club— Belletrist . The first book is Joan Didion’s South and West , so get reading. 
4. Browse pet adoption web sites. Even if you aren't ready to get one (or you already have one), it'll put a smile on your face. 
5. Look at your friends’ (and friends' of friends) wedding registries. Why? Because it's pure fun. 
6. Make a list of special things you want to treat yourself to this year . Keep this saved for motivation the next time you want to quit your side gig or you have a bad day at work. 
7. Download the Shapr app. This program lets you connect with people in your business field...so go in with the goal of networking with two new individuals this month. It's kind of like a dating app, but for work! 
8. Take an online calligraphy class ...we're partial to Laura Hooper Calligraphy . Those swirls! 
9. Download the soundtrack from your favorite show, movie or musical. Then sing along to the whole thing. Is anyone else on a Dear Evan Hansen kick? 
10. Soak your feet in the tub. If you want to be fancy, throw in some bubbles, bath salts or even a bath bomb for some fizz. 
11. Hang those pictures you never got around to . Who else has several stacked under their bed for an aspirational gallery wall? 
12. Do an edit of your closet. You'll feel so much better knowing what you have and what you may need. And don't be shy—toss/donate anything that's worn, doesn't fit or that you won't ever wear again. 
13. Write some snail mail to a friend —just because . We love these chic notecards with sweet sayings. 
14. Buy tickets to a charity event. Browse Facebook to find fun fundraisers coming up. Then pick out which dress you'll wear/rent. Now you've got something to look forward to...while giving back. 
15. Explore a personalized daily vitamin plan , courtesy of Care/of . These custom pre-made vitamin/supplement packs are perfect for girls on-the-go. 
16. Browse Thumbtack to find a new hobby. From voice lessons to dance instruction to the basics of tennis, you'll find an expert to teach you anything that interests you (be sure to read the reviews!). 
17. Download a new book from the public library database onto your e-reader . Did you know that most public libraries let you borrow e-books free of charge (with a library card, of course)? Be sure to see if there is a Librarians' Picks section...it usually has some great under-the-radar selections. 
18. Look up volunteer opportunities near you. Find something that interests you like tutoring local kids or helping at a soup kitchen. Then enlist a friend to join you! 
19. Put on some teeth whitening strips. Who doesn't want more of a reason to smile? Distract yourself from the weird feeling by watching some aspiring musicians do celebrity covers on YouTube. 
20. Dance around to get in the last few steps of the day on your fitness tracker. Let loose. 
21. Do some guided imagery meditation. It will put you in a good place as you cruise into Monday. Take a peek at some of our favorites . 
22. Get your taxes together. Remember how rushed you were this year? Quickly gather any receipts, bills or expenses and make a spreadsheet of anything you need to keep track of. Prepping early will eliminate any guesswork for next year. 
23. Clean your jewelry. Did you know dish soap makes rings squeaky clean? 
24. Make a five-year plan. Who else has received the dreaded interview question ""What is your five-year plan?"" Make one list that’s career-focused and another that revolves around your personal life. 
25. Gather your change and roll it. Or just gather it! Some banks like Bank of America will actually send it out unrolled and deposit it in your account with no fees (if you’re a cardholder, of course). 
26. Scroll through MyDomaine 's Pinterest for travel destination inspo. Japan? Hawaii? Panama? Which destination will you save for next? 
27. Go on OpenTable and snag a coveted reservation weeks in advance. Use Zagat to get some fun ideas. 
28. Clean your makeup brushes. Do you know how dirty they actually get? If you're not a fan of cleaning them by hand, this cool contraption cleans up to 12 brushes at once. 
29. Whip up some fruit-infused water for the week. Simply cut up your favorites and put them at the bottom of a pitcher...pour water over the slices and let it sit for at least an hour in the fridge. A good combo is strawberries, cucumbers and mint. 
30. Search for a friend’s birthday gift months in advance. It will guarantee you'll get them something just as special as they are. 
31. Stretch. Lay out your yoga mat and just do some light stretching. You'll instantly feel more zen. 
32. Treat yourself to fro-yo at your favorite local spot. Splurge on some extra toppings because you're worth it. 
33. Arrange a pretty bouquet. Plus, here's how to do it with flowers from the grocery store. 
34. Try bullet journaling for the week. It may take some time to familiarize yourself with the symbols, but this method will be so good for your time management. 
35. Scroll through old pictures of you and your friends. Is there anything better than a trip down memory lane? You’ll be occupied for hours…plus you may even be inspired to print some photos! 
36. Take a Soul Stroll. Fitness guru Erin Stutland's playlist features music mixed with empowering mantras—the perfect soundtrack for a relaxing walk. 
37. Write yourself inspirational notes to scatter throughout your home. Everyone can use some words of encouragement!

Thornton, AP Arkansas governor says execution plan just part of the job 1 / 3 Back to Gallery LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson comes across as a reluctant figure just carrying out the duties of his office when he discusses his extraordinary plan to execute eight inmates in 11 days. Although the plan faces multiple legal hurdles, no other state has executed that many people so quickly since the U.S. Supreme Court reauthorized the death penalty in 1976, and it has thrust Hutchinson and his solidly Republican state into the center of the debate over capital punishment. It's an unusual position for Hutchinson, a low-key former prosecutor who delves into policy issues with the help of charts and graphs and isn't known for giving fiery speeches. Yet it was he who signed off on the plan to execute so many prisoners before the state's supply of an execution drug expires at the end of the month, with the first two originally scheduled for Monday. ""It's not something I designed from when I ran for governor,"" Hutchinson told reporters at a recent news conference, the only time he's spoken at length publicly about the decision. ""It's something that is put in your lap as the result of 25 years of litigation action and it's here for me."" If allowed to proceed with the executions, they would be the first Arkansas has carried out since 2005 due to legal wrangling and trouble obtaining the drugs. But separate courts granted stays to two inmates before two other courts — one state and one federal — temporarily barred the state from executing any of them at this time. The state is appealing. Aside from the inmates' lawsuits, the plan — which called for double executions on four days — has drawn opposition from civil rights leaders and groups such as the American Bar Association . Religious leaders, meanwhile, have appealed to the devoutly Christian governor's conscience, with one pastor invoking the biblical story of Pontius Pilate , the Roman official who reluctantly ordered Jesus' crucifixion at the urging of a crowd. ""I think (Hutchinson's) a good man. ... What he can't do is what Pilate did: 'I wash my hands,'"" said the Rev. Clint Schnekloth , of Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Fayetteville. Arkansas' lull in executions wasn't a major issue when Hutchinson ran for governor three years ago. But as he prepares to run for re-election, there likely will be little political fallout from Hutchinson's aggressive push for executions, as the death penalty remains popular in his state. Allies of the governor say politics isn't a factor for Hutchinson, who has enjoyed strong approval ratings. ""If he were a wild-eyed crazy man megalomaniac, he'd be making speeches and getting on TV and trying to promote the issue to show the popularity he could gain,"" Republican political consultant Bill Vickery said. ""He's forgoing that and saying we're going to quietly go about justice here and not revel in it."" Hutchinson has been a fixture in Arkansas politics since the early 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan named him U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. During his three years in that post, Hutchinson prosecuted then-Gov. Bill Clinton 's brother, Roger, for cocaine possession and the head of a white supremacist organization on weapons and terrorism-related charges. In 1996, Hutchinson was elected to Congress, where he served as one of the House prosecutors in the impeachment case against then-President Clinton. He's also served as head of the Drug Enforcement Administration and as a Homeland Security undersecretary. As governor, Hutchinson has focused on economic issues, including pushing for tax cuts. That doesn't mean he hasn't taken up tough issues. An abortion opponent, he ordered the state in 2015 to cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood — a move blocked by one of the judges that has halted his execution plan. He also tangled with fellow Republicans over his support for keeping the state's hybrid Medicaid expansion under President Barack Obama 's health care law. This year, Hutchinson opposed legislation aimed at preventing transgender people from using the bathrooms of their choice and he championed a law ending Arkansas' practice of paying tribute to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and the Rev. Martin Luther King on the same day. That moderate record, death penalty opponents say, makes Hutchinson's execution timeline all the more perplexing. ""Does he want to bring Arkansas forward or keep us stuck in the past?"" said Rita Sklar , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas . Michael Lamoureux , Hutchinson's former chief of staff, said the governor's background as a prosecutor is evident in how carefully he approaches most issues. He recalled Hutchinson poring through pardon and commutation applications. ""I would be surprised if any other governor in the country read those with the level of detail he did,"" Lamoureux said. As for the men he's seeking to execute, Hutchinson said he's reviewed trial transcripts and filings for each of them, met with some victims' families and toured the execution chamber. ""When I set those, I thought not only about the process, the responsibility, but I also thought about the victims and what they had endured for the last 25 years,"" he said. ___ Associated Press writer Jill Bleed contributed to this report. ___",Arkansas governor says execution plan just part of the job,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_gzetfSprxLL_58.O2xIVmXPMuCF0I62IhSfzbYyVjpsfAm.EgNZ_zAnJ6p4.Pg8hK2PnFP0n4hkB_TE6.zRXcNcphVmgAQGvN4ToR6RDTMgxVjAKt.gZpQX49bbyCppsQ5uf24o_xvw--,67624f806437fd919fcdb4655a72abb764f71048,www.stamfordadvocate.com,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/60/43/55/12729173/3/rawImage.jpg,http://stamfordadvocate.com//home/collectionRss/Homepage-Hcat-Nation-and-World-1688.php,Nation and World,US,61543.0,0,stamfordadvocate.com,1,Arkansas governor says execution plan just part of the job,0.0,news,0,"[{'sentiment': 'negative', 'name': 'asa hutchinson'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'roger'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'pilate'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'jill bleed'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ronald reagan'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'michael lamoureux'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'johnny depp'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'kelly p. kissel'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'martin luther king'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'stephen b. thornton'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'clinton'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'bill clinton'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'lamoureux'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'barack obama'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'hutchinson'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'rita sklar'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'jesus'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'brian chilson'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'robert e. lee'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'clint schnekloth'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'bill vickery'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'arkansas'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'gallery little rock'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'fayetteville'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'u.s.'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'capitol'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ark'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ark.'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'little rock'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'congress'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'western district of arkansas'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'american civil liberties union of arkansas'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ap arkansas'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'drug enforcement administration'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'house'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'good shepherd lutheran church'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'arkansas'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'homeland security'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ap'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'u.s. supreme court'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'american bar association'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'associated press'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'pontius pilate'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ap image'}]"

Professor values refer to the common value system embraced by a large percentage of professors , just as Hollywood values refers to the common value system of many in Hollywood and the entertainment industry. Professor values are currently one of the most prevalent forms of liberal indoctrination. Andrew Breitbart , the founder of the conservative news site Breitbart News Network , at one point intended to create a category ""Big Education"" in order to expose professor values, but he died before he could implement it. 
An extremely high percentage of professors disagree with conservative principles, but very few replace them with the discredited philosophy of postmodernism . [1] Professors' common value system typically includes atheism , anti-Christian politics , censorship , socialism , unjustified claims of expertise and knowledge (for example, the dogmatic promotion of the theory of evolution [2] ), liberal beliefs, liberal grading , liberal bias , [3] historical revisionism , anti-patriotism, anti-Americanism , lack of productivity, bullying or discouraging conservative students (for example, homeschoolers), [4] and promotion of sexual immorality. [5] 
Such attitudes are also shared by educators in the public education system from grade school through high school, and even by members of public school boards who take an elitist attitude toward parents of the children being indoctrinated with those same beliefs by liberal educators. [6] [7] [8] These same educators, knowing that what they are doing is wrong, go out of their way to deliberately hide the truth from their students' parents, who they know would not support what they do in the classrooms and would call for the resignation or firing of the offending teachers and school board officials who support them; to that end, liberal elitist school boards stand up for the teachers and the professor values they support by ignoring parents' complaints, denying any wrongdoing to them, attempting (by means of deceit and disinformation ) to discredit any information on educator wrongdoing uncovered by parents, [9] blocking their inquiries and even resorting to intimidation and making criminal threats against them (and later denying making such threats when publicly called out on them afterward) [10] in an attempt to silence parental opposition to what are clearly illegal actions against underaged students. 
An excellent example of academics going beyond their expertise is the example of the cryonics movement. Cryonics is a pseudoscience that tries to extend life or achieve immortality in a non-theistic way after a person is legally dead (Cryonic procedures are performed shortly after a person's death). [11] Robert Ettinger was an atheist and American academic who some consider to be ""the father of cryonics"" because of the impact of his 1962 book The Prospect of Immortality . [12] Isaac Asimov was a popular American science fiction writer and a professor of biochemistry at Boston University . He was also an atheist. [13] According to The Cryonics Society, Asimov said of cryonics, ""Though no one can quantify the probability of cryonics working, I estimate it is at least 90%..."" [14] See: Atheism and cryonics 
In a Zogby poll, 58% of Americans said that the bias of professors is a serious problem, while 39% said it is a ""very serious"" problem. [15] The survey demonstrated further that ""an overwhelming majority also believe that job security for college professors leaves them less motivated to do a good job than those professors who do not enjoy a tenured status—65% said they believe non-tenured professors are more motivated to do a good job in the classroom."" [15] One study in 2008 found that "" Texas university professors overwhelmingly favor Democratic candidates in their campaign contributions."" [16] 
Professors rarely engage in wrongdoing while completing research. ""About 1,000 potential incidents of fabrication, falsification or plagiarism in scientific research go unreported every year, according to a survey that suggests such misconduct is far more prevalent than suspected....[A]bout 22 percent was by a professor or senior scientist."" [17] “ There is no place on earth so close-minded as the modern University. The lack of diversity of thought is unmatched anywhere on earth. [18] ” 12 References Free speech 
During the McCarthy era, academia prided itself on resisting attempts to restrict the rights of professors to advocate for Communism or other positions unpopular with the general public. However, in the 21st Century, faculty is not allowed to make statements that could be viewed as potentially making some students uncomfortable. So, minority students hold faculty into account for ""microaggressions"" or the failure to make ""trigger warnings"" if course material deals with topics that some students may find offensive. Universities and their staffs are expected to create ""safe spaces"" where minority students can exchange their pre-conceived notions about issues without being exposed to contrary viewpoints. These politically correct imparatives take priority over any concern for freedom of speech and/or academic freedom. Campuses create “safe spaces” where students can shelter from discombobulating thoughts and receive spiritual balm for the trauma of microaggressions. [1] 
For example, at the University of Virginia , Douglas Muir, an executive lecturer in the Engineering School and the Darden Business School, had used his personal Facebook account to respond to a post about a lecture given by the founder of Black Lives Matter . He wrote, ""Black lives matter is the biggest racist group since the clan. Are you kidding me. Disgusting!!!"" [19] The BLM students protested, and the Dean at first issued a statement saying that Muir's views do not represent the University and later announced that Muir was asked to take a leave of absence. After the leave of absence was announced, the local NAACP still asked that Muir be fired. 
At Cornell University , historically white fraternities (which are not allowed to discriminate based on race or religion) are suspended for even minor violations involving underage drinking. However, when Omega Psi Phi, a historically black fraternity, held a party that ended in a fatal knife fight, no disciplinary action was taken against the fraternity or individuals. Also at Cornell, which has never been racially segregated and was not built with slave labor, black student activists have demanded that the ""Cornell Plantations"" a garden that has held that name since its founding more than a century ago, be renamed because the word ""Plantations"" evokes associations with pre-Civil War slavery. 
In contrast, at the start of the fall 2016 semester, the University of Chicago sent a letter to incoming students denouncing political correctness and ""trigger warnings."" The letter stated, ""You will find that we expect members of our community to be engaged in rigorous debate, discussion, and even disagreement. At times this may challenge you and even cause discomfort."" [20] The American Association of University Professors issued a policy statement against trigger warnings in August 2014. It states in part: “ Some discomfort is inevitable in classrooms if the goal is to expose students to new ideas, have them question beliefs they have taken for granted, grapple with ethical problems they have never considered, and, more generally, expand their horizons so as to become informed and responsible democratic citizens. Trigger warnings suggest that classrooms should offer protection and comfort rather than an intellectually challenging education. They reduce students to vulnerable victims rather than full participants in the intellectual process of education. The effect is to stifle thought on the part of both teachers and students who fear to raise questions that might make others “uncomfortable.” [21] ” See also: Academia and intellectual development 
Presently, there appears to be a higher education bubble that will burst. [22] In addition, college is clearly not delivering the goods in terms of intellectual development for a large percentage of its students. An American study found that forty-five percent of students achieved no significant improvement in their critical thinking, reasoning or writing skills during their first two years of college. After four years, 36 percent displayed no significant increases in these so-called ""higher order"" thinking skills. [23] Students, particularly those who made poor curriculum choices, are increasingly angry that college does not adequately prepare them for the marketplace and leaves them with a pile of debt. [24] Politicizing hiring 
In 2013, a study found that academia was less likely to hire evangelical Christians due to discriminatory attitudes. [25] See also: Atheism and intolerance 
Faculty boards have been known to (on multiple occasions) block the granting of a tenured professorship to candidates for tenure who: profess a Christian faith (see: Atheism and academia ) endorse the mere investigation of Intelligent Design 
For example, professors at Washington University wore white armbands to protest an award of an honorary degree to Phyllis Schlafly , a noted conservative , in an act of political partisanship and utter unprofessionalism. [27] At the University of Chicago , more than one hundred professors signed a letter to protest a proposal to honor conservative-leaning Nobel Prize -winning colleague Milton Friedman . [28]

[51] At Northern Kentucky University, language and literature professor Sally Jacobsen incited some of her students to vandalize a pro-life display by Northern Right to Life, the campus pro-life group. Jacobsen herself also participated in the vandalism, which involved destroying rows of white crosses symbolizing the graves of aborted children. Jacobsen justified the vandalism as free speech, stating, ""I did, outside of class during the break, invite students to express their freedom-of-speech rights to destroy the display if they wished to."" Jacobsen was unrepentant until given the choice of facing criminal charges of theft, criminal mischief and criminal solicitation or apologizing. She chose the latter and also paid Northern Right to Life for damage to the display. Jacobsen was suspended by the university and subsequently retired. [52] College of New Jersey adjunct professor of engineering Bruce R. McKenna, 43, ""surrendered to authorities after allegedly having sexually explicit conversations with an undercover officer posing as a teenage girl.""

Professor Daniel Storm, of the University of Washington , flushed 4 liters of the flammable solvent ethyl ether down the sink, rather than pay the safe disposal fees. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jim Oesterle said that his using an axe to open the containers was particularly dangerous because a spark could easily have ignited the ether. [68] An Associate Professor at Youngstown State University was locked up and fined $50 after baring his buttocks in front of children at a county fair.

[76] Michel Foucault , during the January 1969 Student Protests at the University of Vincennes in France, proceeded to ""gleefully"" throw stones at the police trying to control the riot . He was also one of the few faculty members to participate actively in the protests alongside the students. [77] Walter Hendrik Gustav Lewin , astrophysicist, retired Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, and producer of the most popular physics video lectures on MIT OpenCourseWare . There is some controversy about these videos because a 32-year-old French married woman, Faïza Harbi, suffering from psychological disorders watched some of them and was pressured by Lewin to send him some naked selfies. [78] MIT apparently had some concerns that this caused a Title IX violation, and cut ties with Lewin and the videos. Immoral, unethical, or bizarre behavior James Boster, a professor of anthropology at the University of Connecticut , became unhinged and angrily shouted at a campus, open-air, Christian preacher in a crude and ignorant rant (See Video [79] ). The incident was so embarrassing for the university that they felt compelled to denounce Boster's behavior. [80] Thirty-two hundred educators, most of them professors , signed a letter supporting unrepentant domestic terrorist and fellow professor William Ayers ( a protege of Obama ). They claimed Ayers' bombing of the Pentagon and other government buildings, his direct involvement in at least three deaths, were just ""history."" Notable signers included Professor Rashid Khalidi (No. 5), known for his call to destroy Israel , and the above-mentioned Ward Churchill (No. 814).

She hit reply-all on her email with the comment ""F--- you, Republicans."" [85] In 2009, Central Connecticut State University student John Wahlberg gave an in-class presentation on gun control , pointing out that if students were permitted to carry concealed weapons on campus, school shootings could be more easily stopped. Wahlberg's professor, Paula Anderson, complained to campus police, who interrogated him about the location of all his firearms . [86] Arthur Butz, professor of electrical engineering at Northwestern University , is a prominent Holocaust denier . His most infamous book is The Hoax of the Twentieth Century , one of the first major works of Holocaust denial written in English. [87] A Texas Southern University professor was investigated for allegedly plagiarizing his grant proposal. [88] The President of the University of Texas-Pan American is under investigation after allegations that she plagiarized her 1974 dissertation. [89] An Iowa community college president resigned after publication of a photo that appeared to show him pouring beer into a young woman's mouth. But the school 's board of trustees approved a severance package that officials said was valued at about $400,000 plus benefits. [90] A Kansas university professor, Fort Hays State University debate coach William Shanahan, came ""under fire after a video showing him mooning a room full of students and faculty during a heated debate found its way onto YouTube."" He ""is shown on the video in a profane, in-your-face argument with his counterpart from the University of Pittsburgh ...."" [91] Emory University History Professor of History Michael Bellesiles , a gun control advocate, wrote a book entitled Arming America, The Origins of a National Gun Culture (2000). Gary Wills gave it a glowing review in The New York Times , but admitted later that ""I was took. The book is a fraud."" [92] Bellesiles resigned from his position as Professor of History when an independent committee of scholars examined his work and concluded that ""his scholarly integrity is seriously in question."" [93] According to one columnist, 88 Duke University professors—more than 10 percent of the Duke professorial faculty—endorsed and published an advertisement hurtful to the 3 students who had been wrongly accused of rape during a lacrosse team party , which ""helped create the lynch-mob atmosphere."" [94] When student Rebecca Beach circulated an email at Warren Community College in New Jersey disclosing that decorated Iraq war hero Lt. Col. Scott Rutter would be visiting, English professor John Daly replied: ""Real freedom will come when soldiers in Iraq turn their guns on their superiors."" Young America's Foundation later placed Beech on Fox News 's Hannity and Colmes to expose this and other intolerant e-mail. The resulting outrage ultimately forced Daly to resign and for the president to issue an apology, stating that faculty would now be required to undergo free speech sensitivity training from now on. [95] Ward Churchill was fired from the University of Colorado for fabricating his research and for plagiarizing the work of others. He had falsely claimed to be of Native American descent in applying for the post. Previously, he had infamously insulted the victims of 9/11 as 'Little Eichmanns .' [96] Richard Lenski of Michigan State University was rude and demeaning when replying to a member of the public who asked about his research. When challenged to provide data, professors who push evolutionism on the public evade the question. [97] Madonna Constantine, a New York City Columbia University professor claimed she was the victim of racism in the fall of 2007 when a noose was found on her office door. She was later fired for plagiarizing the work of other professors and even her own students. [98] Vulgar and viciously bigoted anti-religion (mainly Christianity ) University of Minnesota Morris professor and blogger PZ Myers infamously raised the hackles of Catholics by stating his desire to desecrate a Holy Communion wafer (viewed by Catholics as the Body of Christ). [99] The resultant outcry from Catholics resulted in the university removing all links to Myers' blog from their website. [100] Myers has also stated that he is looking forward to the death of George W. Bush so he can travel to Texas and urinate on Bush's grave. [101] Professors engage in grade inflation , giving their students artificially high grades—whether they deserve them or not. In addition, classes have been dumbed down at most universities and require much less work than previously. On August 7, 2009, the above-mentioned PZ Myers visited Answers in Genesis' Creation Museum in Kentucky with a large group of students. During the visit, the 52-year-old eagerly climbed atop a saddled kiddie dinosaur meant for souvenir pictures of children 12 and under. To complete his buffoonery, PZ borrowed a cowboy hat. [102] A Boston University professor was dismissed after sexually harassing a colleague and several students. In his defense, he claimed his medication made him do it. [103] Jean-Paul Sartre committed a lot of polygamy , often seducing many of his own female students while in a relationship with Simone de Beauvoir, often having the latter procure several girls for him to seduce. This behavior was common enough that he became dangerously well known for it by the early 1940s, with Robert Francis, in a hostile criticism of Sartre's play Huis clos , specifically remarking on this behavior by writing ""We all know Monsieur Sartre. He is an odd philosophy teacher who has specialized in the study of his students' underwear."" [104] He also wrote various letters after his womanizing that were vulgar in the description of their sexual relationships. He also frequently did false proposals to marriage to various women, including de Beauvoir. He also largely supported Stalinist Russia and was also responsible for referring to Argentine Marxist -terrorist/ revolutionary Che Guevara as ""the most complete human being to have ever existed."" Simone de Beauvoir acted as a procuress for Sartre for his various sexual escapades. She also has done a threesome sexual relationship where she and Sartre secretly mocked the woman behind her back. She also has been rumored to have molested several of her own students, also being brought to charges with one of them, Sorokine. She also wrote in her book L'Invitée the murder of Olga Kosakiewicz as a means to convey her hate of Olga for her relationship with Sartre. [76] Michel Foucault frequently told his students to go out and take risks on a limb, with neither questions nor answers. In addition, he frequently did LSD , drugs , various forms of sadomasochism, and homosexuality , the latter of which landed him with AIDS , and his infecting countless others during the final years of his life. [77] Intolerance 
Intolerance is a common trait among the almost exclusively liberal professors in modern American colleges, who cannot seem to accept that alternative viewpoints to their own even exist, let alone are held by their more intelligent students. Examples include: Censorship of any mention of creation science in any biology class A recent professor quit his role as adviser to a conservative group at Texas A&M University , opposing their justified opposition to the tactics of terrorist William Ayers [105] Refusing to acknowledge that gun control always increases crime Intolerance of any questioning of their beliefs, even (especially) while forcing them upon their students Intolerance of academic accountability, believing that being granted tenure ensures they can do whatever they want for the rest of their careers, and that they have a right to keep their jobs no matter what. Opposition to drug testing, even though parents have a right to know if their children are being taught by criminals and addicts. Are professor values a crime against humanity? Time magazine's Atomic deacon William G. Pollard has pointed out how professors victimize students, robbing them from experiencing the supernatural and transcendent world (i.e., God ): 
""Throughout the whole wide range and diversity of human experience, with the sole exception of the West in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the world of nature has been alive with, and immersed within, a supernatural world which everywhere made contact with it, although was transcendent to it. It is this whole dimension of reality which the scientific age has lost the capacity to experience or know. An age such as ours which has lost a genuine capacity for knowing and responding to some great segment of reality is actually, without knowing it, in a dark age.... We really have lost a genuine capacity which the rest of mankind has possessed and actively exercised, and we have become a people trapped and in bondage within the prison of space, time, and matter.... It is primarily the business of the university...to maintain the imprisonment of our time. It saddens me to see a new generation being victimized by this all pervasive spirit of the epoch."" [106] Professor values and bestiality Professor PZ Myers said, ""I don’t object to bestiality in a very limited set of specific conditions..."". [107] When asked what conditions were acceptable for bestially to be morally acceptable, Myers was silent. [107] 
See also: Academia and bestiality and Atheism and bestiality 
The atheist philosopher Peter Singer defends the practice of bestiality (as well as abortion , infanticide and euthanasia ). Despite holding these immoral views the liberal and pro- evolution academic establishment rewarded his views with a bioethics chair at Princeton University . [108] Peter Singer was installed as the Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University in 1999 and in 2006 it was reported that he still worked part-time in that capacity. [109] In 2006, it was also reported that Singer worked part-time as Laureate Professor at the University of Melbourne in the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics since 2005. [109] 
Professor PZ Myers , an atheist and evolutionist, said, ""I don’t object to bestiality in a very limited set of specific conditions..."". [107] When asked what conditions were acceptable for bestially to be morally acceptable, Myers was silent. [107]

Based Stickman, real name Kyle Chapman, is this lovely fellow: Here's a tweet w/ ""Based Stick Man's"" real name; another w/his photo; another w/his name & previous arrest; another w/reference to Berkeley. pic.twitter.com/tdBRdKcFpk 
Historian Rick Perlstein wrote a bit about Chapman yesterday : Behold Stick Man 
I’ve seen the Berkeley footage Morgoth is referring to. That’s how I made the acquaintance of Stick Man. 
Berkeley’s March 4 Trump was organized by a man named Richard Black, who announced that members of the alt-right, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists were banned. Among those who did not get the memo were Moshe Daniel, who goes by the nickname “Kilt Man.” Daniel depicts himself on Facebook with a giant serrated knife and a T-shirt featuring the face of the late Chilean fascist dictator Augusto Pinochet, the legend “PHYSICAL REMOVAL,” and another of those silhouettes of people being dropped from helicopters—a Pinochet-favored method for dealing with dissenters. 
The march turned into a “small riot,” as gun-rights blogger Bob Owens, one of the most widely read on the web, and a cool and clear-thinking moderate, described it after reviewing the available documentation. “Both sides came to this incident prepared for a fight,” he wrote, concluding it was impossible to see “who threw the first punch.” In my mind, however, there were at least two moments where the person who threw the first punch was starkly evident. In both cases it was an individual who wore all black, from boots to baseball cap, and carried a distinctive black shield emblazoned with a “V” for victory, and an American flag. The man in black also wore a gas mask, surely in response to a widely disseminated urban legend that antifas are routinely attacking protesters with pepper spray. In one video he whacks a downed anti-Trump protester with the long wooden stick he carries (with two tiny American flags attached, thus he can call it a flagpole). In another, he can be seen smashing his stick down so hard on an unarmed protester’s head that the stick breaks in half. 
He’s since become a right-wing folk hero, and, after Berkeley police arrested him on several felony charges, naturally, a right-wing martyr. 
(much more at the link) 
This is a serious problem. Dedicated, hard core alt-righters who push both Russian derived propaganda and are organizing themselves to conduct violence in a way as to lay the blame on left of center Americans who look to peacefully protest. The first tweets under the hashtag #SyriaHoax came from Russia. Cernovich picked up on it; now it's trending in the U.S.

Soaps N Dreams really says it all about this Etsy Shop.  There, you will find Natural products such as soaps, bath products, beauty products, wall decor and dream catchers.  Soaps N Dreams has 66 items in their shop and I got to experience some of these wonderful products that this Etsy shop has to offer. 

This first two product, shown below, are the E xtravagant and Sleep Scented Shimmer Premium Body Lotions . Both smell totally awesome, but I would have to say that the Extravagant is my favorite of the two.  It smells heavenly!  Both lotions have this shimmering sparkle when you apply it and it leaves your skin so soft!  They are a non-greasy lotion, that absorbs into your skin, leaving your skin moisturized with a fun sparkle!  Great for the evenings or weekend nights out.   



I was surprised, after using this one night, that my skin still felt soft and a little moisturized.  That is exactly what I'm looking for in a body lotion!  This is not a lotion that will absorb and then hours later, you have to apply.  If you have sensitive skin, Soaps N Dreams offers this lotion in an unscented version. 



Available Flavors: 

     *EXTRAVAGANT: Rose & Peony 
     *FRESH:             Sweet Orange Peppermint 
     *LOVELY:            Japanese Cherry Blossom 
     *SIMPLE:            Unscented 

     *SLEEP:              Lavender Vanilla 

The next two products are bar soaps.  The two fragrances, shown here, are the Fresh and Cheerful .  I love the scent of both of these and the Fresh really does have this fresh scent to it.  My favorite is the Cheerful.  It's so uplifting, inviting and I couldn't stop smelling this!   



Each soap came in this adorable burlap bag, wrapped in a pink ribbon.   Fresh Soap has a sweet citrus aroma of ripe oranges with a cool minty kick.  It wakes up all your senses, has a gold shimmer and will leave your skin feeling rejuvenated, to kick start your day!  This bar has the option to include an exfoliation, which is granulated orange peel, suspended throughout the bar. 

Cheerful soap has this therapeutic property that should help with stomach upsets, which is made with a honey base.  It's sweet and refreshing and has become my favorite of the two.  There is a combo of honey and Chamomile and can be made with or without the orange peel exfoliation .  Each bar is a 5.25 oz bar.  The soaps you see above, that I am holding, is just a sample of what the actual soap bars are.

The last product, shown below, is the Simple Bar Soap , available unscented. It is a cream to an off-white bar that has silky moisturizing properties that leaves your skin, happy and healthy.  Simple is made using pure olive oil, coconut oil and palm oil, which all help nourish your skin.  The unscented version is excellent for those with sensitive skin.

Small children and R2-D2s begin to blur. But also, you are reminded, again and again, that this is a family reunion.
Here then, in the spirit of family newsletters, a handful of takeaways:
Star Wars Celebration is being held in Orlando April 13-16, 2017.
No. 1: My favorite part of the weekend — everyone’s favorite part of the weekend — was the touching opening ceremony, a 40th anniversary gala that delivered more than it promised, and indeed felt like a family coming together after a long time, albeit stuck with each other and incapable of polite nothings. Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford explained to George Lucas why he can’t write dialogue. Liam Neeson made a Jar Jar Binks crack. Samuel L. Jackson lobbied to return to the series, despite his character’s death. Lucas, his seeming discomfort running neck and neck with his watery eyes, blurted that, look, “I’m not supposed to say this, but this was a film for 12-year-olds.”
Hamill said the fans were more supportive than his own family, and Ford, in a convincing deadpan, said that “Star Wars” has made ""no difference in his life whatsoever.”
Then John Williams and the Orlando Philharmonic played the film’s legendary score as the audience stood at attention, and finally, here is an image to burn in your head: 40 years of cast and crew, standing in the dark edges of the theater, listening and weeping.

(Gustavo Caballero / Getty Images) No. 2: My next favorite thing at Star Wars Celebration was an art installation, designed by Rancho Obi-Wan, the vast Lucasfilm archive in Northern California, a Library of Congress for “Star Wars” toys and fan-created art and advertising materials and costumes and props from the series. The installation, evocative and touching, was a replica of a boy’s messy, middle-class bedroom, circa 1978, smattered with “Star Wars” bedsheets, music sheets, bootleg lamps, action figures, space ships, carpets, sleeping bags. I visited three times, and each time I witnessed fans of a certain age stop and stand a moment, then put hands to their mouths. Proust couldn’t have said it any better.
No. 3: On the third day of Celebration, an excited young boy dressed as Luke Skywalker shouted to an elevator full of passengers: “We just met Han Solo!” An adult rider asked: “The real Han?” And the boy’s grandmother said: “Come on. We’d be having sex right now.” On the first day of Celebration, coming out of the 40th anniversary event, a different young boy excitedly told his father: “My favorite part was when Han Solo came and then next best part was when the old man with the stick made the music happen.”

(Gerardo Mora / Getty Images) No. 4: Should the “Star Wars” movies end tomorrow — and Lucasfilm plans a couple more decades worth, so fat chance — there’s “Star Wars Rebels,” the lovingly smart animated series on Disney XD that’s attracted talent like Forest Whitaker and David Oyelowo. Or rather, there was “Rebels.” Dave Filoni, the series creator, as close to George Lucas’ creative heir apparent as the “Star Wars” universe has, stood before several thousand packed into a ballroom and said its fourth season, this fall, will be its last. He said every generation should get its own “Star Wars.” His eyes watered, and the audience gave a long standing ovation, a response as warm as the reaction to “The Last Jedi” a day earlier. If you have any doubt of Filoni’s star power, among the amateur Stormtroopers, there were cosplay Filonis, in his trademark cowboy hat and facial scuff.

See more videos No. 5: There’s so much licensed at Star Wars Celebration, it’s easy to forget, amid copyrights and trademarks, there were creations made from sheer love. Of course, that Dewback reptile couch, going for $10,000, came from love, too; same goes for that artist who sold “Star Wars” posters re-imagined as 1940s pulp-fiction covers. But what do you make of the full-scale models of Imperial Walkers (those metal moose-like weapons), and motorcycles retrofitted to resemble hover bikes? Lucasfilm art director Doug Chiang gave a fascinating talk on the company’s design philosophy — how the prequels draw from early 20th century handmade creations, while the original films are more rooted in the mass production and decay of post-WWII America. But where does Darryl Sorensen of Belvidere, Ill. (outside Rockford), fit in? He took the raw material of Chiang’s spaceships and redesigned his 2003 Saturn to resemble one. He commutes in it. It has targeting scopes and its own R2 droid. It sat on the exhibition floor here, much admired.
Video: Billy Dee Williams at Star Wars Celebration Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian) makes an appearance at the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando.

See more videos No. 6: One of the more pleasant surprises was running into Billy Dee Williams, Lando Calrissian himself. He wore a royal blue suit and matching sunglasses, rarely removing them throughout his “Smooth Talkin’” panel. At 80, he made a considerable case for his side career as a painter (he has work in the National Portrait Gallery), he said he will not be in a new “Star Wars” movie in the near future (“I’m not that interested in working that hard anymore”) and he held the sweet, calm, awkward energy of a man who had wandered in and sat bewildered, surrounded by people dressed like Lando Calrissian.
No. 7: Keeping thousands of “Star Wars” fans sitting patiently in a large, cramped room, especially after many had spent hours in line to get there, is a task no one deserves. Yet DJ Elliot and Mark Daniel, longtime Celebration MCs, have a niche: They asked for volunteers to give up their seats or they would start removing people, and the hall got quiet, until the joke hit slowly and rolled across the room. A couple of days later, Elliot asked if anyone (such as himself) met their spouse or partner through “Star Wars”? A surprisingly large number cheered. “I doubt George Lucas had that in mind,” Elliot said.
No. 8: It’s a good time to be a “Star Wars” fan: There is a new generation of fans/creators working alongside the first generation of fans/creators, intent on paying homage and making something new simultaneously. But one of the disappointments of the “Force Awakens” era was EA’s “Battlefront” video game, massively hyped, intricately detailed and deadly dull to play. It’s notable, then, that the panel for “Battlefront II” avoided those criticisms. Developers brought a beautiful trailer and a fresh take: The new game will be told from the POV of the Empire. It will bridge the gap between “Return of the Jedi” and “Force Awakens”; its characters so fully realized that a prequel novel, “Battlefront II: Inferno Squad,” is due in July. The game arrives Nov. 17. Leaving the panel, a young guy in a Darth Vader helmet, his voice made digitally baritone, boomed out: “Yes, but is it fun?”
No. 9: Speaking of vague promises of fun: Disney is building two giant “Star Wars”-themed worlds, in Orlando and Anaheim, set to open in 2019. To show the scale of the project, they brought footage of a large brown construction lot, inside which almost nothing is recognizable yet. They spoke of “going to ‘Star Wars,’” piloting the Millennium Falcon and drinking blue milk but offered almost no details of attractions. However, they did bring impressive concept art showing a slight Eastern influence — their “Star Wars” land is apparently set in Stevie Nicks' living room. When the panel moderator asked if the land is a new planet, one of the Disney imagineers answered a bit sharply: “It’s new to you.”
No. 10: Star Wars Celebration, being a collector’s paradise, features a lot of Celebration-exclusives, available here for four days only, exclusive Legos, exclusive pins and posters. So give Gentle Giant, a Burbank, Calif., based geek-centric toymaker, props for making clever fun of exclusivity itself, and without ripping anyone off: They brought an $85 re-creation of the Trash Compactor monster from the Death Star — specifically, the weird green bird-lizard thing that was included with Kenner’s Death Star playset in 1978. The packaging played off the silver-striped Kenner boxes from vintage “Star Wars” toys, and the best touch: Also included were perfect replicas of Kenner’s cheap foam trash.
No. 11: Speaking of elaborate tributes to deep-cut “Star Wars” references: On Friday afternoon, roughly four dozen men, women and children, in matching orange space jumpsuits, chanting “Ice cream!” and carrying plastic ice-cream makers under their arms, made their way through the convention center, to the confusion of nearly everyone. Here’s the deal: That is called the Running of the Hoods, and it doesn’t get nerdier than this. Willrow Hood is the name of a character, seen for a fleeting second in “Empire Strikes Back,” running through Cloud City when Lando Calrissian orders its evacuation. The actor in the film, for reasons lost to time, was carrying an ice-cream maker. And so now, at every Celebration, in a bit of Pythonesque perversity, groups of fans periodically run through the crowds carrying ice-cream makers under their arms. And now you know.
No. 12: Attending a family reunion means inevitably being cornered by someone who wants to explain what they do with great intensity. You could do much worse than being cornered by “Star Wars” collectors. Their seminars drew some of the longest lines of attendees and offered some of the most improbable tales. Deep dives into food-related “Star Wars” collectibles anyone? Who knew about the great art found on a “Star Wars” tie-in from a Winnipeg restaurant chain? Or that Mexican cola caps with “Star Wars” images are fiercely sought? Another panel, on fakes and scandals, detailed master movie-poster forgeries and elaborate scams from former Kenner toymakers — all of which, even the bootlegs, can produce a piece worth something to someone, considering the market.
Fans dress the part at the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando.
No. 13: Saturday ended the way you would have hoped, with thousands of “Star Wars” fans seated in a large darkened room, watching episode after episode, the smell of popcorn wafting over everything. After a day of hearing the series discussed abstractly and minutely, after hearing producers and designers promising even greater things in the future, it was nice, simple, a reminder of why everyone was here. Saturday night moved into Sunday morning, and Harrison Ford and Chewbacca ran into danger again, and in the back, a dad slept upright, his mouth hanging open. Beside him sat a young girl, his daughter, clutching a Princess Leia action figure. Wide awake, she elbowed her father:
“Dad! You’re snoring!”

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Joe Johnson has seen a lot in his 16 years in the NBA. So the veteran didn't flinch with the clock ticking down and the game tied. 
All that experience is why the Utah Jazz brought him in this season. 
It paid off when Johnson drove the lane and hit a floater at the buzzer, giving the Jazz a 97-95 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers after Utah lost Rudy Gobert 17 seconds into their playoff opener on Saturday night. 
""I just wanted to get as close as I could to the basket, and it was a good thing it went down,"" Johnson said. 
Johnson, who scored 21 points, was left isolated against Jamal Crawford on the final play. He powered his way inside and lofted a shot over Crawford and DeAndre Jordan that bounced around the rim before falling in. A video review confirmed it was good. 
""I just try to be patient, get to a sweet spot, and make the right play,"" Johnson said. 
He's made an NBA-best eight game-winning buzzer-beaters in the past 10 years. 
""That's what he's been doing all his career,"" Utah's Boris Diaw said. ""So when he gets the ball at the end of the game, we are pretty confident."" 
The Jazz were dealt a blow before either team had settled into the game. 
Gobert sprained his left knee on the game's first play when he banged knees with Clippers forward Luc Mbah a Moute, leaving the Jazz without their 7-foot-1 center who averaged 14.0 points and 12.8 rebounds during the regular season. 
""We felt and knew that a lot of people probably were counting us out when he went down, but man, we stuck together,"" Johnson said. 
Utah steadied itself behind Johnson and fellow veteran George Hill, both of whom were brought in to balance the inexperienced Jazz. Johnson finished with 21 points off the bench and Hill added 16 points. 
Gordon Hayward had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Utah. 
Blake Griffin scored 26 points and Chris Paul added 25 points and 11 assists for the Clippers, whose seven-game winning streak ended with their first loss since March 26 against Sacramento. 
A driving Paul banked in a floater with 13 seconds to go, tying the game at 95. 
The Jazz didn't call a timeout. 
""We just wanted to have it where they couldn't set up on us,"" Hayward said, glancing at Johnson. ""We just wanted to get it and go and let this man go to work."" 
Making their first playoff appearance in five years, the Jazz outshot the Clippers and narrowly controlled the paint, owning a 42-40 edge. 
The teams tied with identical 51-31 records in the regular season. The Clippers earned the No. 4 seed and home court by virtue of winning the season series 3-1. 
""We fought until the end of the year to get it, and now we've given it right back,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. 
Utah withstood Paul's offensive outburst in the fourth after the Jazz led by eight on Hill's 3-pointer. Paul rattled off 10 straight Los Angeles points, drawing the Clippers to 90-89 on a 3-pointer. 
Hayward and Johnson scored, keeping the Jazz ahead 94-91. But Johnson lost the ball and Hill fouled Griffin, who made both free throws to get the Clippers to 94-93 with 23 seconds left. 
After a timeout by the Jazz, Griffin fouled Derrick Favors, who missed the first and made the second after it hit the rim and went in for a 95-93 lead with 18 seconds left. 
""We've got to be better,"" Paul said. ""They played harder, they were more physical."" 
Gobert was setting a screen when he and Mbah a Moute made contact and Gobert fell to the court clutching his left leg. 
He had to be helped off by Diaw and Hill. A team spokesman said X-rays were negative, and Gobert was taken from Staples Center to have a precautionary MRI. 
""We felt a little bit stunned out there,"" Diaw said, ""but then we regrouped and got back on the horse."" 
The matchup between Gobert and Jordan was expected to be a key in the best-of-7 series. Jordan finished with 10 points and 15 rebounds and got called for a technical in the fourth with the Clippers down six. 
""We have the rule, no fourth-quarter techs, and he got one,"" Rivers said. ""It didn't make a huge difference, but it could have for sure."" 
Utah outscored the Clippers 16-10 to open the third before Crawford's jumper put Los Angeles ahead 70-68. Hayward singlehandedly outscored the Clippers 6-0 to send the Jazz into the fourth leading 74-70. 
Neither team led by more than six points in the first half. The Clippers were ahead by six when the Jazz outscored them 14-2 in the second quarter to take their own six-point lead. Griffin got stripped under the basket by Hayward, but he hit a 3-pointer and made a layup on the Clippers' next two possessions to key a 14-8 spurt that ended with the half tied 52-all. 
TIP-INS 
Jazz: The last time the teams met in the playoffs was a first-round series in 1996-97, won 3-0 by the Jazz. ... Utah also won the teams' other postseason series 3-2 in 1991-92, which was interrupted by the riots after the Rodney King verdict. 
Clippers: Backup G Austin Rivers (strained left hamstring) did some shooting for the first time Saturday since his injury. He's out for at least the first two games of the series. ... Former Clipper Baron Davis shared hugs with the referees from the courtside seat. 
UP NEXT 
Game 2 is Tuesday night at Staples Center.

In 1682, the Dutch Republic held an election across seventeen time zones, using nothing more sophisticated than pencil, paper and telephone cable. An immensely complex logistical undertaking -- polling places in Manhattan, Montreal and Nootka Sound had yet to open by the time voting closed in Australia -- the 1682 election has long been viewed as a turning point in Dutch political history. For the first time, a Richterist party would have undisputed political control over one of Europe's Great Powers. Commanding an absolute majority of seats in the Volksraad, the first party ever to do so under the Mailey reforms, the Richterist camp had free license to enact its governing policies. The van Helsing pensionary would see the passage of a host of major legislative programs, including key Richterist proposals on workplace safety, workers' compensation, and overtime pay, as well as the first proposals for universal basic income to all citizens of the Netherlands.
The traditional view of the Richterists is of a coalition of Hollander radicals, prairie co-operatives, and Amsterdam's middle class, feeling the pressures of globalization for the first time. In a thorough review of recently unsealed electoral archives, however, Ericsen provides evidence that what drove the transformational van Helsing pensionary was significant and often critical early support from Catholics.
Religious toleration was the official policy of the Dutch Republic -- a requirement for a small, urban, densely populated society inflamed by religious tensions. In a society that valued wealth and its understated display, however, Calvinism was still the faith of Dutch elites, and membership in a Reformed congregation often brought with it a network of powerful, politically connected patrons. The rise of Richterist organizations, however, provided Catholics, nonconformists, and other minorities with a parallel path to obtaining wealth and political power...",,http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzLt__IAG7GWRhea8m4ZpNzXsFlbj9PLSpGeKJGyuWD9LEechbeERocSG4Fego4BL3n9WeN_P6kMwUIoSIDHxV11oi_8hzaJFbsTNSYYwXf3tGRbZB2PB1N,6c98736c1da7d0bf21890e20e059bad11fe9bde0,forums.sufficientvelocity.com,data/avatar/1491229832/m/5/5182.jpg,http://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/forums/grand-strategy-ic.57/,Grand Strategy IC | Sufficient Velocity,US,58816.0,0,sufficientvelocity.com,12,"IC - Magic, Shell and Steel | Page 17 | Sufficient Velocity",0.0,discussions,16,[],[],[]

It has been a rough week for United Airlines and some of its passengers.
That deluge didn't let up on Sunday, when a local news outlet in Houston reported that a couple had been kicked off their flight from Houston to Costa Rica for their wedding.
Michael Hohl and Amber Maxwell said they boarded their flight on Saturday and were about to take their seats when they saw a passenger napping across the row they were assigned to.
Hohl said that instead of waking the man, he and Maxwell decided to sit a few rows in front of their assigned seats.
""We thought not a big deal, it's not like we are trying to jump up into a first-class seat,"" Hohl told KHOU, a CBS affiliate in Houston. ""We were simply in an economy row a few rows above our economy seat.""
Hohl said that after he and Maxwell sat down, a flight attendant asked if they were in their assigned seats. When the couple said no and explained why they had moved, Hohl said the attendant denied their request for an upgrade and asked them to return to their original seats.
Hohl said that although he and Maxwell did as they were told, a US marshal boarded the flight and asked them to get off the plane. The couple said they complied with that demand as well but found the overall experience ""strange.""
""They said that we were being disorderly and a hazard to the rest of the flight, to the safety of the other customers,"" Hohl said. ""I think customer service and the airlines has gone real downhill.
""The way United Airlines handled this was really absurd,"" Hohl added.
United has disputed Hohl's version of events, saying the couple had repeatedly tried to sit in upgraded seats and refused to comply with requests to move back to their assigned seats.
""We're disappointed anytime a customer has an experience that doesn't measure up to their expectations,"" United said in a statement to KHOU . ""These passengers repeatedly attempted to sit in upgraded seating which they did not purchase, and they would not follow crew instructions to return to their assigned seats. We've been in touch with them and have rebooked them on flights tomorrow.""
United has been engulfed by controversy since a video emerged last week that showed 69-year-old David Dao being violently dragged off a flight after refusing to give up his seat to make room for crew members. Dao's attorney said on Thursday that Dao sustained injuries and planned to file a lawsuit against the airline.
United has adopted a rule that crew members can't displace passengers already on board the plane, The Associated Press reported.
Maggie Schmerin, a spokeswoman for United, said in an email to the AP on Sunday that the change was an initial step in a review of policies and was meant to ensure that situations like Dao's never happen again.

Finding a reliable plumber can be a daunting task. This is because the market is flooded with these service providers. As such, one is expected to do proper research before landing any service provider out there. It is not advisable to settle with the first person you come across during your search. For the right professional plumbers in Melbourne FL residents can search locally or online.

Before engaging any contractor to do your job, ensure you have interviewed several of them thoroughly. Remember you need someone who is able to do the plumbing task you have. So, be sure you have vetted them rigorously before hiring their services. Explored in this article are some helpful tips for choosing the best plumber in Melbourne FL.

Qualification level is a vital thing to look at before hiring any plumber out there. Make sure you are dealing with a well-trained person. Remember plumbing problems are sometimes hard to diagnose. As such, you want the job to be tackled by someone who has undergone proper training. You may ask to see their certificates in order to ascertain their qualifications.

Secondly, you should determine how long they have been operating before engaging their services. It is obvious you need someone who has been around for quite a long time. As such, you have to ask your prospective plumber how long he has been executing similar tasks. If possible, settle with plumbers that have 10 years of experience.

The other vital credential to observe is a license. Ensure the contracting company you are intending to hire is properly licensed. You need to go for a company that has been allowed to operate in your area. You should not forget to check whether or not the licenses they have are valid and up to date. Do not make that blunder of hiring an unlicensed contractor.

An insurance cover is an important consideration. It is advisable to go for a company that is properly insured. Hiring a well-covered service provider is a way of protecting your assets and finances. This is because something wrong can occur while the contractor is undertaking your project. To ensure the company is well-covered, ensure you ask to see their certificates of insurance before hiring.

Reputation is another very important aspect to look at before hiring a plumber. Check how these contracting companies have been reviewed by the previous clients. You can check these reviews by visiting their business websites. Check if there are any negative comments or pending issues with past customers. Also, call the Better Business Bureau for further clarification about their standing in the industry.

Lastly, consider asking for a list of people your prospective contractor served in the past. You want to call them up and inquire about the quality of the services offered. Ask to know if the plumping projects were completed successfully and on time. If you have time, visit their homes to see the kind of work done before making your final judgment.

CLEVELAND — The suspect in the random killing of a retiree posted on Facebook made his living mentoring teens in Cleveland, but his life appeared to be unraveling under the weight of gambling debts and trouble with his girlfriend. 
Rambling videos he shared showed his despair, saying he was out of options and wanted to kill as many innocent people as he could. 
While authorities have not found any evidence that he killed anyone else, the manhunt for Steve Stephens stretched into a third day on Tuesday and far beyond the neighbourhood where police said he shot a 74-year-old man who was picking up aluminum cans on Sunday after spending Easter with some of his children. 
Stephens, 37, could be anywhere, authorities said, calling it a nationwide search. A $50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to his capture and prosecution. 
Stephens posted a video of himself killing Robert Godwin Sr., a former foundry worker who had 10 children, police said. In it, he said, ""I snapped, I just snapped."" But police would not speculate on what was behind it. 
""Only Steve knows that,"" Williams said. 
In the video, Stephens told Godwin a woman's name and said, ""She's the reason that this is about to happen to you."" Godwin did not seem to recognize the name. 
The woman Stephens spoke of, Joy Lane, said in a text message to CBS that ""we had been in a relationship for several years. I am sorry that all of this has happened."" 
She also said Stephens was ""a nice guy"" who was good to her and her children. 
Stephens filed for bankruptcy two years ago despite holding down a job as a counsellor helping young people develop job skills and find employment. The behavioural health agency where he worked said an extensive background check before he was hired turned up nothing worrisome. 
In one video posted on Facebook, Stephens said that he gambled away everything and that he and his girlfriend had planned to marry but did not, without saying why. He blamed her for what was about to happen. 
Some friends said they knew about his gambling. But the videos showed a man they did not recognize. 
Alexis Lee, who saw Stephens last week, said his childhood friend always seemed respectful and got along with everybody. 
""He never ever told me he had problems or issues. It was always good things,"" Lee said. ""He was always just so happy and cool, calm, collected, like, that's why it's so shocking."" 
Other neighbours said he was quiet as a kid and intelligent, recalling how he went to college and got a master's degree. 
""He was just a no problem person at all, compared to a lot of people,"" said Cynthia Coley, a former neighbour . 
In one video in which he blamed his girlfriend, Stephens said he woke up last week and ""couldn't take it anymore."" 
Investigators said that Godwin was the only victim so far linked to Stephens, despite his claim on Facebook that he killed over a dozen people. 
On Monday evening, Facebook announced that it was launching a review for reporting harmful content following the killing. The company said that Stephens posted a video of himself announcing his intent to commit murder, then two minutes later posted another video of himself shooting and killing Godwin. A few minutes after that, he went live and confessed. 
The company said it disabled Stephen's account within 23 minutes of receiving the first report about the video of the fatal shooting and two hours after receiving any report. 
""In this case we did not receive a report about the first video, and we only received a report about the second video — containing the shooting — more than an hour and 45 minutes after it was posted,"" said Justin Osofsky, Facebook's vice-president of global operations. ""We received reports about the third video, containing the man's live confession, only after it had ended."" 
Officers searched dozens of places around Cleveland without finding Stephens or any other victims before expanding the manhunt. Detectives spoke with the suspect on Sunday by cellphone and tried to persuade him to surrender, police said. 
Law enforcement officials said his cellphone was last tracked Sunday afternoon in Erie, Pennsylvania, about 100 miles (160 kilometres ) east of Cleveland. Police in Philadelphia said eight elementary schools and a high school were locked down Monday while they investigated reported sightings but found nothing.

The implants are used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence after childbirth, but some can cut into the vagina - causing severe discomfort. Some women have been left in permanent pain, unable to walk, work or have sex. One called the implants ""barbaric"". The UK regulatory body MHRA said it ""sympathises"" with the women affected. Kate Langley had to give up her business as a childminder because the pain was so intense she could not look after the children. The surgeon who first examined her, she explained, ""could see the [mesh] tape had come through my vagina - protruding through. ""The mesh had cut its way through - like a cheese-wire."" Other women, reporting similar symptoms, have said the perforation was so severe their partners had been injured by the mesh during sex. Ms Langley, who described the meshes as ""barbaric"", said she has had 53 hospital admissions to try to end the pain, but the mesh was so near the nerve it could not be fully removed. She has been left in permanent pain by the implants and has nerve damage. Living in pain The plastic meshes are made of polypropylene - the same material used to make certain drinks bottles - and manufactured by many different companies. They are used to ease incontinence and to support organs such as the vagina, uterus, bowel, bladder or urethra which have prolapsed after childbirth. Claire Cooper began to experience pain three years after her operation. Doctors wrongly believed the source of discomfort was her womb, which she had had removed at the age of 39. 



When the pain continued, she said a GP told her she was imagining it. The news made her want to take her own life. She said she ""mapped out"" her suicide, but wanted to live on for her children. She still lives in pain and said her husband has ""turned into my carer"". ""We haven't had sex for four-and-a-half years. This stuff breaks up marriages. ""I wouldn't at all be surprised if there are mesh-injured women that have taken their own lives and didn't know what the problem was,"" she said. ""I want the procedure banned, I want the material banned."" Tens of millions of pounds Between April 2007 and March 2015, more than 92,000 women had vaginal mesh implants in England, according to NHS data from the Hospital Episodes Statistics, obtained by the Victoria Derbyshire programme. About one in 11 women has experienced problems, the data suggests. Now, more than 800 women in the UK are taking legal action against the NHS and manufacturers, including US pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson - the biggest makers of mesh implants. Its subsidiary, Ethicon, said it was ""vigorously defending litigation"". Many of the women the BBC met said they had never been told by their surgeons about the potential risks associated with the implants. US payouts The MHRA says for the majority of women, the use of vaginal mesh implants is safe and effective. The meshes are still prescribed on the NHS across the UK, although a recent review in Scotland said they should not be routinely used for pelvic organ prolapse. Experts believe if the women are successful in their legal case, the NHS payout for compensation could be tens of millions of pounds. In the US, thousands of women have sued manufacturers, receiving payouts that total several billion dollars. Consultant urogynaecologist Dr Sohier Elneil said she sees patients in the UK who have been left facing severe pain and unable to walk. ""The typical type of patient I see is a patient who is incapacitated by severe pain of a chronic nature. Often they are on high-dose medication, including opiates. ""They become so incapacitated that many of them are either walking by crutches or sitting in wheelchairs and perhaps more dramatically so, they become unable to look after their families."" Currently in the UK, there are around 100 types of vaginal mesh implants. 'Little evidence required' So far, not one model has been recalled in the UK. According to one expert, Professor Carl Heneghan, manufacturers have to provide little evidence before their product is clinically approved and made available on the NHS. ""The regulatory body... doesn't even look at the device,"" he explained. He said manufacturers just have to provide documents that show their vaginal mesh implant is similar to one already on the market and it is highly likely to be approved. One leaked email from Johnson & Johnson suggested it had known problems existed with one of its products since 2004. The email said the company needed to start a ""major damage control offensive"" because ""the competition will have a field day"". The manufacturers said highlighting this email in isolation was ""extremely misleading"". 'Helped millions' An MHRA spokesman said it was ""committed to help address the serious concerns raised by some patients"". It added: ""The greater proportion of the clinical community and patients support the use of these devices in the UK."" Ethicon said ""these devices have helped millions of women"". It said it had ""acted appropriately and responsibly in the research, development and marketing of its pelvic mesh products"".

This concept sounds fucking great. Alec Baldwin as a middle management type talking baby in a suit? Fucking brilliant.

The Boss Baby is the newest animation from the people at DreamWorks and stars Toby Macguire and Alec Baldwin as a baby boss who's sent to this family who work for their competitors, a company who sells puppies. The baby is tasked with gaining intel on the puppy companies latest project as Baby Co are worried that all the love for babies is being stolen by puppies. 

Now this is one of those movies where the trailer dropped and it went viral online. I think I logged onto Facebook one morning and about fifty of my friends shared it. Now this happened recently with another movie last year which was The Secret Life of Pets. It presents itself as such a genius concept and has a lot of really funny stuff in the trailers. And that's kind of it. Similarly to what happened with The Secret Life of Pets, a lot of the best and funniest moments in The Boss Baby were in the trailer and that's gonna leave a lot of people disappointed. 

There are as well some interesting choices with the style of animation in The Boss Baby too that makes it quite jarring to watch. For instance, as you'd expect from a child the age of the main character, there is a lot of imagination sequences in this film. And what the director and the animators choose to do is make these a completely different style to the rest of the movie. A very 70's anime style. And I guess the first two or three times it's used it works well, right at the beginning of the movie before Alec Baldwin's character arrives, but later on in the movie a lot more crazy stuff happens in the plot and the over use of these imagination sequences kind of left me guessing, is this real? Even at the end there's a reveal about the narrative of this story that makes you kinda question, wait, was any of that real? The line between what's actually happening in the narrative and what's in the mind of the main character is very very thin and gets blurred a lot and it left myself quite confused at some points. I even heard the kid in the row in front of me who was part of the target demographic for this movie (say 8 or 9 years old) turn to his father during the closing act and ask where it was in  the boy's imagination. The cutaway scenes are very confusing.

But this is a kids movie and no kid is going to be reading into The Boss Baby and analysing it as much as I do and other critics choose to do so I've got to kick this down to basics in order to tell you all about the good things in this movie.

Alec Baldwin is great as the Boss Baby. He's hilarious and Baldwin's voice is just the perfect fit for this character. He's so funny and it's just a terrific piece of casting. Despite what I said earlier about all the really funny bits being in the trailer I still found this to be a really enjoyable time. I was laughing a lot and found myself getting invested in the adventure of this baby and this kid. Children are definitely going to have fun with this movie. Is it a really good animation on par with the likes of Toy Story or Wall-E? No. But of course it was never going to be that good. This is something that I've talked about a lot in my reviews and if I ever get the time I will go into more detail on is audience expectations. If you're going into The Boss Baby wanting an Oscar worthy animation then I'm sorry but you're going to be disappointed. But if you want a no holds barred family friendly movie that anyone of any age can sit down and enjoy as a pure popcorn flick, then you are going to come out of The Boss Baby smiling. 

So guys I had a lot of fun with the Boss Baby. A flawed but solid family film with a great premise that is just never quite fully realised but nevertheless I'm going to give The Boss Baby a big fat....

You're welcome. WILL SHE, OR WON'T SHE... Studious and (mostly) sensible, the only thing Molly Wakefield wants to do is get through Senior Year and graduate. Well, that and hit the beach in her spare time. Okay, fine - and go shopping every once in a while for a new dress... (and who could blame her?) And things are going according to plan - until the day she spies Weston McGrath, handsome star athlete and scholar, spying on her in study hall. A tad creepy? Maybe. Thrilling? Absolutely. You see, Weston McGrath happens to be one guy no one can get close to. Despite her best efforts to avoid it (because let's face it - the guy isn't exactly ""boyfriend material"") Molly and Weston form a friendship. And more.... Sort of. But it's a friendship that comes with a price - because Weston just cannot seem to stop screwing things up. Or saying all the wrong things. Possibly in that order... And who has time for an 18 year old ""fixer-upper"" that should know better? Not Molly. Or does she? 
Note: This YA book is intended for 17+ due to the vulgar language used by its male characters (and occasionally the females as well, even though they're too lady like to do it throughout the entire book).

You're welcome. ABIGAIL DARLINGTON IS AWKWARD… She will never be “that” girl. You know the one: that girl on campus, confident in her own skin. Always saying the right things. Putting herself out there. Knows how to talk to a guy without stammering. Nope. Shy but clever, and easily embarrassed, Abby is fine being the wallflower in her circle of outgoing, beautiful friends; she would rather read about a sexy book boyfriend than actually have a live, breathing one. …BUT CALEB LOCKHART IS WORSE. Star goaltender for the University’s hockey team, Caleb is quiet and broody, preferring the solitude of his orderly, regimented life. He doesn’t like, or need people—and plans to keep it that way. One more year left of hockey and he’ll be long gone. AWKWARD NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD. Both their lives change the day that Abigail falls for Caleb. Well, falls directly on top of him, to be accurate. Because sometimes we don’t settle into love. We fall there. 
Note: This book contains cursing, and LOTS of it. It also has sex, uncomfortable and often awkward situations. Not to mention, the secondary characters say some really inappropriate s**t. Not intended for readers under 17

Review: 
What happens when you take two socially awkward characters and throw them together?  An adorably cute and sweet romance—this is exactly what I got from A Kiss Like This.  Abby is the wallflower of her group.  Shy and quiet, she prefers staying in to going out.  But don’t let her silence fool you, she’s clever and can come up with a witty comeback when the need calls for it.  On a rare occasion that her friends drag her out, she falls into the arms of hockey star Caleb.  Like…literally falls into his arms.  Caleb is big, broody and quiet.  Their awkward courtship was at times hilarious, frustrating but most of all adorable.  It definitely left a smile on my face. 
I will say that I had a hard time equating them with college students.  Their behavior brought back memories of high school and first crushes.  I get being painfully awkward and shy but they were almost too hesitant.  My only other pet peeve is that I saw the drama coming from a mile away and it was a little over-the-top.  Other than that, the characters were decently developed.  The secondary characters added additional depth to the story.  Jenna was particularly hilarious, I love a sarcastic character.  This can definitely be read as a standalone.  I haven’t read the other two books in the series and I don’t think I will.  I prefer Ney’s other series. 
If you like awkward characters that leave a smile on your face, definitely take a look at this one.   -Peace and Love, Buxom J   About Sara Ney Sara Ney is the USA Today Bestselling Author of the How to Date a Douchebag series, and is best known for her sexy, laugh-out-loud New Adult romances.

'I'm thrilled for him' - former Green Party leader Trevor Sargent aiming to become Church of Ireland priest
Sargent led the political party for six years between 2001 and 2007.
Quote: : FORMER GREEN PARTY leader Trevor Sargent is set to become a minister of the faith in the Church of Ireland.
In an interview with today?s Irish Independent Review magazine, Sargent confirms that he is training as an ordinand at the Church of Ireland Theological Institute, while simultaneously studying for a Theology Masters at Trinity College Dublin.
Should all go to plan, Sargent would first become a deacon before then ascending to the priesthood.
Sargent led the Green Party for six years between 2001 and 2007. He served as Minister for Horticulture in the following government before losing his seat in Dublin North in the 2011 election.
He now lives in Wexford where he works in organic horticulture.
Today, current Greens leader Eamon Ryan said that he is ?thrilled? for his former colleague.
?As a friend and colleague, I?m thrilled for Trevor,? he said this afternoon.
I think it?s a natural fit for him, it?s not a surprise. I think it?ll be great for him.
Ryan added that the party, whom Sargent continues to informally advise as a committed environmentalist, were aware of the direction he was taking.
?We knew of his interest in theology and the Church of Ireland of course,? he said.
I think there?s a connection there, between green politics and a certain kind of spirituality. It makes a lot of sense for Trevor, and I?m thrilled for him. http://www.thejournal.ie/trevor-sarg...facebook_short",,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg__thRcNZ4RaX239dQA4Is6aibn2e3f8VSe_MtuE2JuP6dfhasoUBXCtkrK1aoA068QOS3YmaBpmuDESde_HzZLq5FLsOyQw4I-,75a8c3c46fdb51e55f1549373779c12be9bfb091,www.peoplesrepublicofcork.com,,http://www.peoplesrepublicofcork.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=17,The Langers Forum - Peoples Republic Of Cork Discussion Forums,US,,0,peoplesrepublicofcork.com,8,The Greens say YES! - Peoples Republic Of Cork Discussion Forums,0.0,discussions,8,[],[],[]

Do any of these dishes sound familiar? Mock meat made of shiitake mushrooms; fish meat from seaweed and soy; cheese and mayonnaise made of cashew, and ice cream made of coconut milk. 
If you have yet to encounter them in your meals, better prepare your palates for the coming wave of meatless diets. And take note, it’s not a seasonal thing—like fasting for Lent. This one’s for keeps, and it’s the millennials who are serving them up. 
Several surveys, including those from the Chicago-based food research firm Technomic, The Vegan Life Magazine and the Vegan Society, showed that millennials—people born between the 1980s and 2000s—are increasingly going meatless. ADVERTISEMENT 
Here in the Philippines, the trend is no different. 
Bev Caluma, 22, an English teacher, FX trader and mountaineer started dropping meat from her diet in 2012. In July last year, she adopted a vegan diet and lifestyle devoid of animal products, such as leather clothes, shoes and accessories. Bev said the switch would hopefully “improve [her] health and athletic performance, and minimize [her] impact on the environment.” A kinder life 
Yeye Baron, 20, a senior journalism major from Centro Escolar University-Manila, has been vegetarian for over a year. A video by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) made her “realize the value of embracing a kinder life.” Becoming vegan is her next goal, Yeye said, “because I can’t stand any form of animal atrocity. And I want to do something for our environment.” 
Australian ultramarathoner Wayde Nash, 34, who has been living in Vietnam as an English teacher and “house husband,” began his vegetarian journey at 15. He then went vegan. “I don’t need animal products to be strong and healthy, so why should animals suffer for something that is unnecessary?” he asked. 
Yvonne Liboro, 23, decided to go vegan last year after watching Erin Janus’ documentary “Dairy is F**king Scary.” 
Vegan restaurant owner Elpidio Mijares Jugalbot III, 26, was reviewing for the nursing licensure exam in 2011 when he shunned all types of meat, eggs and dairy, and increased his fruit and vegetable consumption. He wanted to prove his theory that this would “improve [his] blood circulation, especially toward the brain,” and help him think better during the board exam. After passing it, he watched the documentary “The Earthlings” and decided to go vegan. 
Patricia B. Castillo, 28, recounted how she became a vegetarian in 2012. When she hugged her dog whom she had rescued after it was almost killed by a neighbor, she saw fear in its eyes. “That’s when I realized how animals fear death as much as humans do,” she said. Vegan online groups 
A vegan since April 2014, Enrica Nicole Martina “Clem” M. Lagon, 22, was a pescetarian for two years when she was accepted as an intern at Peta on her third year in college. It was during her internship that she felt encouraged to follow a vegan lifestyle. ADVERTISEMENT 
Bev, Yeye, Wayde, Yvonne, Elpidio, Patricia and Clem are all members of the Manila Vegans Facebook group, one of the biggest Manila-based online vegan communities, with over 11,000 members. The Facebook group helps spread the word about accessible, sustainable, cruelty-free and compassionate living, and comes up with creative recipes as well. 
Meat substitute provider Quorn Philippines has been closely monitoring the slow but steady rise of this meat-free society. “Younger, more educated consumers are seeing the need to reduce meat consumption for health and sustainability reasons. While we have just launched in the Philippines, strong early sales reinforce evidence of this trend,” said Quorn CEO Kevin Brennan during his March 29 visit to the Philippines. British brand Quorn—now owned by food giant Monde Nissin—produces meat-free proteins recently introduced in the country. 
Vegetarian millennials now number more than vegetarian members of any previous generation, according to Mercy for Animals organization. The New York Times wrote that “an estimated 12 percent of millennials say they are ‘faithful vegetarians,’ compared with 4 percent of Gen X’ers and 1 percent of baby boomers.” Running as tool 
Apart from “a bit of mocking from mates with fragile masculinity tied to meat consumption,” Wayne said he had no real issue to resolve. “I use my running as a tool to advocate going vegan. If I can run an ultramarathon without meat, then clearly it’s not essential,” he said. 
Elpidio said that “The Earthlings” awakened his animal-loving nature. “I also learned that animal agriculture is the number one culprit in global warming or climate change. As a Christian, I even consulted the Bible and it affirms that it is prudent to go vegan as it entails mercy and compassion not only to one’s self, but also to others. It made me realize that I could live my life without harming other living beings,” he explained. 
Said Clem: “It’s actually easy to have a vegan lifestyle if you have the right kind of attitude. Sometimes you have limited options when you eat out but … you can always bring your own food or get delivery from Juicesabel, Greenery Kitchen, etc.”

There is a pleasant turbulence in the field of learning and development for food safety and quality professionals and there’s a reason why I’d like to describe it as enjoyable—adult learning programs are seeing exponential enrollment numbers now more than ever before. You Might Also Like 
Remote “teaching and learning” is making it easier to not only add new skills to the existing talent pool but to pave the way for a bigger and better workforce. 
Below are some noteworthy trends in the realm of food safety and quality training. 
From a Book to a Bite The traditional class room learning environment is transforming into a platform for exchanging ideas rather than the typical teacher-student dynamic. Bite-sized learning via on the job demonstrations, participating in webinars as a cadence program, and engaging in frequent team development meetings are changing the way us professionals learn. 
Walking the Talk Two-week programs are being condensed to one week and week-long training courses are being packed into a few days, where and when possible. 
It has been established that the adult attention retention period has reduced over the past decade, not because of our inability to learn but because of our increased ability to multitask in the digital age. That being said, changes are being made to the traditional learning environment. Candidate assessments are considering more onsite evaluations than classroom-based reviews as the real measure of training efficiency. 
Learning Too is Now Social Social media platforms have and still continue to take the world by storm. Teaching and continued professional development tools have embraced this change as well. Mobile compatible applications make it easier for “learning-on-the-go” programs and more participants are beginning to interact with one another nationally and internationally. Real-time problems are seeing real-time solutions through web forums and social media networks. 
A few of my favorite modes of social learning include interactive webinars , Twitter chats, Facebook polls, and online gamification tools. 
Blending with Blended Learning Blended learning models, as the name suggests, amalgamates both traditional instruction delivery and web-based learning. This is of great advantage to most food safety and quality professionals as it takes into account varying schedules and levels of experience. 
For example, food traceability systems are merging with technology and software. This in turn has seen a progression from paper-based reporting to digital time stamps on multiple mobile phones in real time. 
If we are building tools to solve the problems of both the present and the future, we ought to ensure our learning and development channels are up to speed as well.",Trends in Food Safety Training,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.A4RT_GnMtOd.vR2_yOEbj8aMHPvq3SLqiT.SZHb.amz2znLmeRxnmK.Efd1L57PDJVgOu_PAvGEZOECGTtG_US0RITOhAL.8-,79017144ab0083914406355c4080f60a755d5341,www.foodqualityandsafety.com,http://www.foodqualityandsafety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Blog02_0417.jpg,http://www.foodqualityandsafety.com/feed,Food Quality & Safety,US,,0,foodqualityandsafety.com,1,Trends in Food Safety Training,0.0,news,0,"[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'judy'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'judy sebastian judy sebastian'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'u.k.'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'apex food consultants'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'gcc'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'food quality & safety'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'facebook'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'holiday retirement group'}]"

My review….. This is another gorgeous read by Tilly Tennant, which was just as I expected after loving the first in this series, Rome Is Where The Heart Is . If you haven’t already read book 1 then I highly recommend that you do (you will find my review, along with relevant links, here: Rome Is Where The Heart Is by Tilly Tennant @TillyTenWriter @bookouture #BlogTour #BookReview ), closely followed by A Wedding In Italy , as the story follows on. 
I warmed to Kate straight away and I have thoroughly enjoyed catching up with her again. She is a very real and likeable character who is much braver than I would ever be. I like the fact that her move to Italy hasn’t been plain sailing as I think this makes it a much more realistic story. (Although we all like a fairy tale sometimes.) I love her beloved Alessandro, he is such a sweet character. They are an adorable couple, but not without their disagreements. 
Alessandro’s family are amazing! I love his mother, especially, and the fact that there are lots of them and they are all so close. They remind me of my family, although we don’t all congregate at my Mums most days as they seem to! 
I love how close Kate is with her two sisters also. It would be so hard for me to move away from my family (I struggled living in different counties, let alone countries!), so it very easy to understand how much she misses her sisters. 
Kate doesn’t have it easy settling in to her new life and at times it seems like the world is against her and she, understandably, worries that she might have to admit defeat and move back home, but she’s not going to give up easily and thankfully she has her happy ending. 
Beautifully written, as always. I highly recommend! 
Many thanks, as always, to Bookouture for my auto-approval status on Netgalley and to the lovely Kim Nash for inviting me to take part in the blog tour.

Sun, spaghetti and sparkling prosecco. When it comes to finding love, there’s no place like Rome… 
Kate is living the dream with her gorgeous boyfriend Alessandro in his native city, but the reality is sometimes a little less romantic than she’d hoped. Every day in her new home is a fight against leaking pipes, her cantankerous landlord and her less-than-perfect grasp of the Italian lingo.
All around her there is talk of weddings, but when a secret from her past is thrust out into the open, Kate must fight to prove to Alessandro’s Mamma – and the rest of his formidable family – that she truly is Italian marriage material.
With the women in Alessandro’s life on a mission to break them apart, the cracks begin to show and Kate starts to question if Alessandro really is the man of her dreams. Can love and the city of romance conquer all, or is that just a fairy-tale?
Let Rome steal your heart this summer in this gorgeously romantic escapist read. Perfect for fans of Jo Thomas and Abby Clements.

About the author….. From a young age, Tilly Tennant was convinced that she was destined for the stage. Once she realised she wasn’t actually very good at anything that would put her on the stage, she started to write stories instead. There were lots of terrible ones, like The Pet Rescue Gang (aged eight), which definitely should not see the light of day ever again. Thankfully, her debut novel, Hopelessly Devoted to Holden Finn was not one of those, and since it hit the Amazon best seller lists she hasn’t looked back. Born in Dorset, she currently lives in Staffordshire with her husband, two daughters, three guitars, four ukuleles, two violins and a kazoo.

(Bizpac Review) – What happens when media have a chance to eat their own, even quash a competitor, yet hesitate or refuse to do it? 
As Bill O’Reilly loses sponsors and fights sexual harassment claims, multiple outlets would love nothing better than to obtain the Fox News anchor’s financial records and, especially, the sealed matrimonial records that document the long court battle with ex-wife Maureen McPhilmy. 
Records bound to be filled with “juicy” items with which to dig an even deeper hole for the already tarnished O’Reilly. 
However, according to a Friday report by The Hollywood Reporter, CNN seems to be resisting the siren’s call, as much as the casual observer might think the rival network would love to clear the way for Anderson Cooper, O’Reilly’s 8 pm competitor. In fact, multiple sources confirmed to THR that, even though CNN was close to filing a motion to unseal O’Reilly’s matrimonial records, they are now leaning against this action, despite the fact that some executives are strongly in favor of it. CNN's internal debate: Go after Bill O'Reilly divorce records? https://t.co/vKhAUpKnQo pic.twitter.com/dUDIX4DS8d 
— Hollywood Reporter (@THR) April 14, 2017 
While CNN has been happy to contact Fox News advertisers as they jump off the O’Reilly ship, but “wading into a sticky divorce” may come a bit too close to media cannibalism than some at the network are comfortable with. Or maybe they fear karma. 
Although the records of the 2010 court battle are confidential, some information has become public, including a 2015 Gawker report about trail transcripts detailing testimony from O’Reilly’s teenage daughter saying her dad struggles to control his rage and that she witnessed her dad “choking her mom” and dragging “her down some stairs” by the neck. 
Whether or not CNN or another network is able to get court records unsealed, it may not matter in the end, since O’Reilly is now accusing his ex-wife of defrauding him into a separation agreement to “finance an existing extra-marital relationship.” Because of this, a New York judge may be making lots more heretofore private information public. 
But whatever happens, CNN’s reluctance to hit O’Reilly where it hurts the most could prove that there is indeed at least some honor among thieves, er, media outlets! 
Or, media execs living in glass houses are afraid to throw a stone that big.

Conservapedia proven right , again: Dems attain 43 votes to block Neil Gorsuch with a filibuster . [2] RINOs want to change the Senate rules in order to confirm the pro-choice Gorsuch . 
In Saudi Arabia , high school ladies are being herded like cattle. [3] 
An audit of Department of Housing and Urban Development shows financial records have been so poorly kept that they are correcting $520 billion in bookkeeping errors. [4] 
Political correctness run amok : “ Swedish and Norwegian newspapers on Friday said they would refrain from the tradition of publishing April Fool's Day jokes this year over fears that it might spread ' fake news .'” [5] 
Americans never seem to learn from history . This is especially true of certain crimes by the same elites we return to office year after year. [6] 
The RINO strategy of picking the stealth, pro-choice nominee Neil Gorsuch fails to pick up more than 2 Dems , far short of the 8 to 9 Dem votes needed to defeat the upcoming filibuster . [7] Gorsuch should be replaced by a pro-life nominee who has broad support, as Sam Alito and Clarence Thomas did . 
"" Trump goes after Freedom Caucus ringleaders"" who blocked the "" Obamacare Lite"" bill . [8] Conservative Jim Jordan seems the most likely to break ranks and support Trump . 
About those surveys you get in the mail from Republicans and Democrats : why do those surveys end up looking the same, even to the paper they print them on? [9] 
Is health insurance really good for anyone? A founder and operator of several successful clinics for the less-well-off offers an alternative. [10] 
Don't count Donald Trump out yet, whatever you're thinking. He's playing his enemies, as he did in real estate . [11] 
Why is Neil Gorsuch a poor choice for the Supreme Court ? Because he puts precedent on a par with the Constitution and above the Divine law of life . [12] 
A broad review of Trump 's dismantling of the progressive agenda. [13] 
Trump tosses out global warming orders by the Obama Administration . [14] This gives coal miners a chance . 
Witches to cast spell on President Donald Trump - again! [15] Evidently, they think Hillary Clinton is pro-witch! 
Update on Unplug the NFL : the Oakland Raiders leave the city with a $95 million debt, and skip town to fleece the taxpayers in Las Vegas for even more money. [16] The NFL is corporate welfare for billionaires . UPDATE : taxpayer cost is $750M in Vegas hotel tax hike. 
New York City and Chicago areas: Some parents threw a hissy fit after the school recently began enforcing a long-ignored state law requiring that public schools host a daily pledge of allegiance to the flag. [17] 
Nebraska Democrat Party chairwoman Jane Kleeb posted a video to Facebook last week showing herself and her staff preparing a bunch of welcome baskets for incoming refugees - voter registration forms included. [18] 
Over 21% of U.S prison inmates are not Americans. [19] Tomi Lahren 
Setback for liberal claptrap : Tomi Lahren declared herself to be pro-choice and insisted it would somehow be hypocritical to favor limited government and be pro-life , and then refused to apologize. Now she has been properly ""banned permanently"" from the conservative Blaze. [20] The only hypocrisy is abandoning the unborn . 
Liberal logic : after the RyanCare fiasco the RINO Reince Priebus declares that the GOP needs to ""start governing."" [22] But hasn't that been Priebus's responsibility as Trump 's chief of staff ? 
Conservative Sen. Rand Paul was excluded by House RINOs from developing the "" ObamaCare Lite"" bill, and now Sen. Paul is considered the victor over Paul Ryan as it failed to pass. [23] 
Ineffective House Speaker Paul Ryan fails to find enough votes to pass his "" ObamaCare Lite"" bill . [24] Ryan should resign .

Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez has refused to comply with Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer requests. Texas Governor steps in. [28] 
Conservatives reject "" ObamaCare Lite"" bill ; House delays vote. 
Dems announce they will block with a filibuster the ""I would walk out the door"" Neil Gorsuch , who smugly said he would have done that if the president had asked him to overturn Roe v. Wade . Time for Gorsuch to be replaced by a pro-life nominee . 
"" Gorsuch : ‘I accept’ Roe v. Wade as the ‘ law of the land .’"" [30] Dems succeed in eroding the pro-life base of Trump and the Republican Party , proving that Trump's advisers violated his pro-life pledge . 
Has US District Judge Derrick Watson committed treason ? His ruling against the travel pause violates not only US law but also the Constitution itself. If, moreover, one can show it gives aid and comfort to enemies of the United States , that is tantamount to treason. [31] 
Neil Gorsuch defiantly thumbs his nose at pro-lifers : ""When Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch was asked what he would do if President Trump asked him to overturn Roe v. Wade , he said he would walk out the door ."" [32] 
Tomi Lahren claimed to be a "" constitutional conservative ,"" and was a rising pro- Trump star at the Blaze. Then she declared she's pro-choice -- contrary to Trump's campaign pledge -- and she might want to start looking for a new career with people who do not care about the unborn . Glenn Beck has apparently suspended her show. 
FBI devotes government resources to searching for a jersey of Tom Brady in Mexico , and the lamestream media won't even criticize the FBI for the waste . [33] Unplug the NFL to end its government subsidies, which are at least $1 billion annually . 
More nonsense resulting from liberal logic : "" Transgender Wins International Women’s Weightlifting Title,"" as the male-turned-female breaks four national women's records. [34]

"" Draining the Swamp : Health and Human Services Cuts: Decrease Budgets, Increase Efficiency ."" [36] 
A liberal college professor creates a list of news outlets she does not like. The real problem: the Mainstream Media are the real ones putting out "" fake news ."" [37]

YOU'RE FIRED, GET OUT : ""After refusing yesterday's request to resign, the U.S. Attorney for Manhattan was just fired by the Trump administration ."" [52] 
Barack Obama has a team of 12 people to keep tabs on President Donald Trump . [53]

Maynooth University is planning a €300m redevelopment of its campus over the next seven to 10 years as it seeks to cater to growing numbers of students. 
The university’s president, Professor Philip Nolan, told the Sunday Independent that €157m in funding had been secured – with a large chunk of this coming from the European Investment Bank – and that the university is looking to raise the rest of the funding. 
“The negotiations are at a very early stage. We expect government to fund approximately €100m of this, and have requested this through the recent public sector-wide review of capital requirements,” Nolan said. “If granted this would bring the overall state contribution to our €300m programme to €140m.” 
The university recently broke into the top 50 of the Times Higher Education Young University Rankings (for universities aged 50 or under). 
It has over 11,000 students and has been growing the number of first preferences received under the CAO points system in recent years. 
Nolan estimates the university will have about 16,000 students by 2025 and the new plan is designed to right-size the campus for that number. 
The plan calls for spending €184m on teaching and research facilities, €78m for student accommodation, €24m for sports, recreation, arts and culture, and €21m for land and infrastructure. 
Planning applications for parts of the plan will be filed in about six months, Nolan said. 
It’s part of a wider strategic plan which will see the university put a particular focus on postgraduate education, broadening its research output, and attracting more international students, having revamped its undergraduate offering in recent years. 
Nolan backed reform of the funding model for university education. “I think it’s important that people understand just how stark things are right now. In 2007, every student in a non-laboratory discipline that was being educated in this institution, and UCD, and Trinity, had €9,000 spent on them. They were contributing €800 and the State was contributing €8,200,” Nolan said. 
“In 2015, we would have spent about €7000 per annum on that student’s education. The student was paying €3,000 of that and the state is paying €4,000… so you’re paying a lot more for about €2,000 per annum less.” 
He said the decline in funding was hitting disadvantaged students in particular. 
Nolan said the fairest system would be to share the costs of undergraduate degrees between the State, employers, and students, who would only begin making contributions when their income reached a certain threshold after the degree.

0,,2017-04-18T11:26:45.000+03:00,[],,,english,0,2017-04-03T08:00:00.000+03:00,,"Privacy Concern Raised Over Search Service on Verizon Phones By Anick Jesdanun 03 2017 Is Verizon planning to spy on its customers? You might conclude that it is after reading Verizon's privacy policy on an upcoming AppFlash service, which promises easier access to search and apps on Android phones. The policy says Verizon may share data on features and services you use, along with the list of apps you have installed on your phone, with other Verizon businesses to target ads. 
The privacy watchdog Electronic Frontier Foundation described AppFlash as ""spyware."" 
Not so fast, Verizon says. In a statement to clarify its intentions, Verizon says users must explicitly grant permission before using AppFlash. Verizon says customers will be able to easily disable the service, and no one will be required to use it. 
The statement, however, doesn't say exactly what permission Verizon is seeking. The privacy policy says users can control AppFlash's access to your location and contact information, but says nothing about giving control over broader usage data. At most, users can turn off ad tracking on the phone by digging through the settings. 
The EFF has since retracted Thursday's blog post, pending further investigation. The group had said AppFlash represents Verizon's intention ""to start monetizing its customers' private data as soon as possible."" The post came just days after Congress voted to block Obama-era restrictions on what internet-access companies like Verizon could do with information about you. 
Verizon has gotten heat over user privacy before. Last year, Verizon agreed to pay a $1.35 million fine over a ""supercookie"" that federal regulators said followed phone customers on the internet without their permission. 
The complaints come as Verizon evolves into an advertising business, with the purchase of AOL in 2015 and the upcoming acquisition of Yahoo's internet businesses. Verizon, in knowing what web sites and apps you use, could charge companies more for ads that are targeted to your personal habits. 
Android phones and iPhones already come with search services similar to AppFlash. The main difference is when people use AppFlash, Verizon gets more data on your interactions and can target ads accordingly. 
AppFlash is a Verizon-branded version of Evie Launcher, which people can already get through the Android app store. After installation, one swipe from a phone edge brings up a search bar; one search pulls content from the web and installed apps at once. For instance, after searching for the movie ""Beauty and the Beast,"" Evie offers one-tap access to buy tickets through Fandango or to read reviews through IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes. 
Verizon says AppFlash will be tested initially on a single phone, LG's K20 V. Verizon has offered no details on its plans beyond that, though the app is for Android only and Apple forbids carriers from shipping iPhones with their own apps already installed. 
While Verizon promises to seek permission, it's not yet known how Verizon will do that and how clear it will be in explaining what's being collected and how it will be used. 
Evie Launcher does ask permission to access location and contact information, and you can say no. It also asks for permission to replace the regular home screen experience for launching individual apps. However, Evie says nothing about privacy during the setup; its privacy policy online says personal information such as usage activity and search queries will be collected, but not shared with third parties. 
For those who use AppFlash, Verizon says data collected may be shared with other Verizon businesses for ad targeting. AOL, which Verizon owns, can place ads tailored web users on many other sites, too. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

MORE IN CUSTOMER DATA Canadian Accused in Yahoo Hack Has Bail Hearing By Rob Gillies 05 2017 A Canadian man accused in a massive hack of Yahoo emails said Wednesday he'll live with his parents and forgo access to phones and any electronic equipment if he's allowed out on bail. 
Officials allege that Karim Baratov poses an ""extremely high flight risk"" because of his alleged ties to Russian agents. 
But his lawyer Amedeo DiCarlo said that Baratov has never been to Russia and he will not flee if freed on bail. Baratov arrived in court for his bail wearing a black shirt and sweat pants with his legs shackled. His parents provided him with a dress jacket. 
""Flight risk is the issue,"" DiCarlo told reporters after arriving at the courthouse in a chauffeured Rolls Royce. ""We are going to have measures put in place so that is not going to happen."" 
Baratov's parents have agreed to act as their son's sureties. His father, Akhmet Tokbergenov, has agreed to turn off the internet in the family home if that's what the court requests. 
Baratov, 22, said he registered an internet business in 2014 that made about $81,000 ($110,000 Canadian) that year registering websites, renting web spaces and preventing web servers from hack attempts. He said he made less in in 2015 and 2016. He was not asked directly about the allegations against him. 
U.S. law enforcement officials call Baratov a ""hacker-for-hire"" paid by Russian Federal Security Service members. He has Kazakh origins, arriving in Canada in 2007 and becoming a citizen in 2011. 
Baratov was arrested last month and faces extradition to the U.S. The breach at Yahoo affected at least a half billion user accounts. 
He was indicted in the United States for computer hacking along with three other people, including two alleged Russian intelligence agents. 
Officials have said Baratov has the money to leave Canada and the ability to destroy evidence related to his alleged activities while on the run. 
Prosecutor Heather Graham said police seized about $22,000 ($30,000 Canadian) cash from his home and another $670 ($900 Canadian) from his wallet when he was arrested. 
Baratov said he had virtually nothing in his bank accounts and testified that he largely financed a string of luxury cars that included a Lamborghini Diablo, an Austin Martin and a Mercedes Benz. He said half of the money he paid for the cars came from his parents. He also said half the $95,000 ($128,000 Canadian) down payment on a three-bedroom house came from his parents. 
Social media pictures of Baratov show him as an exotic car buff. His Facebook and Instagram profiles were peppered with photos of cars. 
Graham noted that Baratov posted online that he travels to Russia often but Baratov testified he has never been to Russia and only posted that on behalf of a friend to get advice. 
In a scheme that prosecutors say blended intelligence gathering with old-fashioned financial greed, the four men targeted the email accounts of Russian and U.S. government officials, Russian journalists and employees of financial services and other private businesses, American officials said. 
In some cases using a technique known as ""spear-phishing"" to dupe Yahoo users into thinking they were receiving legitimate emails, the hackers broke into at least 500 million accounts in search of personal information and financial data such as gift card and credit card numbers, prosecutors said. 
The case, announced amid continued U.S. intelligence agency skepticism of their Russian counterparts, comes as American authorities investigate Russian interference through hacking in the 2016 presidential election. Officials said those investigations are separate. 
Alexsey Belan, one of the others accused, is on the list of the FBI's most wanted cyber criminals and has been indicted multiple times in the United States. It's not clear whether he or the other two defendants, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, will ever step foot in an American courtroom because there's no extradition treaty with Russia. 
The indictment identifies Dokuchaev and Sushchin as officers of the Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB. Belan and Baratov were paid hackers directed by the FSB to break into the accounts, prosecutors said.

0,dNews Fetchers (noreply@blogger.com),2017-04-16T23:32:04.000+03:00,[],,,english,0,2017-04-16T23:32:04.000+03:00,,"Thyroid problems are not rare in children, but they are not as common as parents usually believe. For example, only about five percent of patients with hyperthyroidism are under fifteen years old.
Especially when their kids are overweight, it is important to keep in mind that these children are typically short, while kids who are overweight because they eat too much or exercise too little are usually tall.
Sleeping a lot is another common symptom that brings parents to their pediatrician looking for a thyroid problem. While that symptom usually deserves looking at your child’s thyroid function tests, without other symptoms, they are likely to be normal and you might look for obstructive sleep apnea, depression, etc., as other possible causes.
Thyroid Problems 
This is not to say that kids can’t get thyroid problems. From conprivate part hypothyroidism and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis to Graves disease, children and teens can indeed develop thyroid problems.
Reviewing some of the common signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can help you to know when to get thyroid function tests ordered for your child and when to look for another cause for your child’s symptoms.
Symptoms of Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism most commonly occurs when the thyroid gland isn’t producing enough thyroid hormone, either because it can’t (primary hypothyroidism) or because it isn’t being stimulated properly (secondary hypothyroidism).
Kids with primary hypothyroidism will usually have a low free thyroxine level (free T4) and an elevated level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and associated symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as:
Short stature or deceleration of growth Rough, dry skin Constipation Cold intolerance Fatigue, decreased energy Sleeping more Easy bruising Delayed bone age on X-ray Delayed puberty (teens) Galactorrhea (white chest discharge) Pseudoprecocious puberty (early puberty) Headaches Vision problems Newborns with conprivate part hypothyroidism are usually identified on their newborn screening test, which routinely tests for hypothyroidism.
Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism 
In hyperthyroidism, also called thyrotoxicosis, there is an excess of thyroid hormones. These children will usually have a high T4, T3, and a low TSH.
Symptoms of hyperthyroidism can include:
Emotional lability, with your child being more likely to cry easily, be irritable and excitable, etc. Short attention span Finger tremor Increased appetite Weight loss, failure to thrive Enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) Exophthalmos (protruding eyes) Upper eyelid lag Infrequent blinking Flushed skin Excessive sweating Muscle weakness Tachycardia and palpitation High blood pressure Whether you think your child’s thyroid is underactive or overactive, talk to your pediatrician if you think his thyroid isn’t working properly. As thyroid disorders are sometimes hard to diagnose and thyroid function tests can sometimes be hard to interpret, an evaluation by a pediatric endocrinologist can also be helpful.

0,John Gault (noreply@blogger.com),2017-04-16T23:38:40.000+03:00,[],,,english,0,2017-04-16T23:38:40.000+03:00,,"From the LA Times article linked at the bottom... Science and public policy are always an interesting mix.

At the right you can see the consequence of government policy as it relates to the science of managing water in California.

Indeed this the Oroville dam during the peak of the California non-drought.

Below we will see how this relates to the ""March for Science.""

I came upon the "" March For Science "" after trying to understand the motivation behind things like the riots in Berkeley, CA.  Here's the Facebook page of one the ""attendees"" - it says: "" Headed to Berkeley to disrupt the Neo/Nazi White Supremacist jerk circle today Nervous af but determined to bring back 100 Nazi Scalps ""


Hmm...

It struck me that the ""March for Science"" is basically similar in nature to this and a variety of similar events that have taken shape over the last few months:  Woman's March in DC, Tax March (which our image is above seems to be from), etc.

So before we start let's take a look at what the idea is behind ""science"" ( from Wikipedia ):


In truth it seems pretty simple.  You perform experiments related to some hypothesis, collect evidence, and based on these create a theory.

Science in turn depends on mathematics: deduction, inference, and so on.

Now both science and mathematics are independent of how one might feel about how it's conducted or what conclusions are discovered. 

That's sort of the point. 

We can believe in scientific results or mathematical proofs because the ""discovery"" stands on its own - a result (which may or may not be correct) - independent of how it was discovered.

(Of course, as I write here "" absolute morality "" is required too, i.e., no lying about results, evidence, experiments, and so on.  If you make up evidence, results, etc. then what's the point? - Anyone can do that about anything - hence no real result.)

So let's take a look at the ""principles"" behind this march (from here ).  Under ""Core Principles"" we find "" Science that Serves the Common Good "" - Here it says: "" We recognize that inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility in science are critical to ensure that science reaches its potential to serve all communities .""

Imagine Ohm's law.  Without it today's society would not exist - no electronics or electrical power of any kind.  Invented, no surprise, by Georg Ohm in 1827 (see this  - an individual of ""societal privilege"" for sure, he actually had time to perform scientific research).  I think this law "" serves the common good, "" at least if you believe that humanity needs electricity. 

Seems to me Ohm's law is a good example of actual science.

Even if its been used for executions (killing people for the Berkeley educated not afraid of scary subjects).

That's right, it kills people (in perhaps an ""unfair"" or ""socially unjust"" way), but kills them non-the-less.

Next paragraph we find this gem "" Political decision-making that impacts the lives of Americans and the world at large should make use of peer-reviewed evidence and scientific consensus, not personal whims and decrees. ""  Here ""scientific consensus"" are code words for ""vaccination deniers,"" ""climate deniers,"" Trump, and all the rest of the "" deniers .""

These sciences are "" settled "" and require no further investigation.

Exercise for the reader: Find where in the ""scientific method"" we (as humans or science or engineers) operate only on ""decided outcomes"" from science. (We can use electricity without Ohm's law, but it will be out of our control because we won't understand it...)

Next we find ""Cutting Edge Science Education"" where it says "" Science works best when scientists come from diverse perspectives, and we must work to encourage and support a new generation of scientists that reflects that. ""

Here there's a subtle and clever conflation of "" science "" with the process of "" scientific discovery .""  ""Science"" could care less who discovers uncovers its principles.  Many western discoveries were also found in other countries at other times.  But the nature of this is true social engineering as you see, for example, with ouster of president of Mozilla (see this ).  It's silly to believe the operation of the browser (which after all is simply the science of electrons, etc.) cares what this guy believes.

On the other hand, the process of ""scientific discovery"" is always (or at least nearly always) more efficient with different points of ""scientific"" view (as opposed to ""social perspective"" implied by the above).  Again a subtle and clever conflation of university-developed social constructs and actual science.

The next item appears to be a political statement targeted at the business of science publishing: ""Open, honest science and inclusive public outreach.""  Here we ask (at least if I am not being thwarted by secret code words) for publicly funded science to be publicly available. 

(Gee, where's the Penn State climate data when you need it... Oh wait, only available if hacker get it.)

This is probably a mistake - at least if the organizers thought about it.

After all.  On the one hand if a giant asteroid was about to hit earth (or at least the potential was discovered) would you only want a few scientists in secret to plan our safety plans?  Or would you rather the trajectory and so forth be public so that the entire planet can participate in finding a solution.

(Don't conflate this with the impending ""climate"" disaster though, that's different...)

Under funding we find "" De-funding and hiring freezes in the sciences are against any country’s best interests. We believe that the federal budget should reflect the powerful and vital role that science plays in supporting our democracy. We advocate federal funding in support of research, scientific hiring, and agency application of science to management. This funding cannot be limited to a few fields or specific demographics -- scientific support must be inclusive of diverse disciplines and communities. ""

One images this is actually asking for everyone, even "" deniers "" to be funded.

This seems unlikely, doesn't it?

One needs look no further than the Los Angeles Times for how government with the funding of important things "" The government failure at the heart of the Oroville Dam crisis (Image from article at top of post) . 

Really seems much more like a ""March for NonScience (Nonsense?)""

By Sara Ashley O’Brien 
PHILADELPHIA (CNN) – – New York City is on its way to mandating that Uber allow tips. 
On Monday, the Taxi and Limousine Commission — which regulates yellow cabs and for-hire vehicles — said will propose a rule requiring Uber and similar services to enable tipping in their apps. 
That’s according to a letter that was sent from deputy commissioner Christoper Wilson to the Independent Drivers Guild on Monday and viewed by CNNTech. 
Pokémon Go Can Make You Happier, Study Says 
IDG, which formed last May, is a coalition of 50,000 drivers for companies like Uber, Lyft and Juno. It said tipping is a top concern among its drivers. 
Lyft has supported tipping since its early days, but Uber has repeatedly refused to include this option, citing a “hassle-free” experience that’s better for both drivers and riders. 
IDG raised the concern with Uber in June. After making no headway, it proposed a petition to the TLC in February to try to force Uber’s hand. 
IDG founder Jim Conigliaro Jr. estimates that drivers could make $300 million more a year if tipping practices for yellow cabs in NYC are applied to Uber rides. 
“New York City’s professional drivers have traditionally depended on gratuities for a substantial portion of their income. Cuts to driver pay across the ride-hail industry has made tipping income more important than ever,” said Conigliaro in a statement. “The exploitation of ride-hail drivers must end and this is an important first step.” 
Coffee That Won’t Stain Your Teeth…Because It’s Clear 
Conigliaro said that Uber’s “big excuse” has been that tipping complicates the service’s “ease of use.” But he said there are ways to make the process “as seamless as it is right now.” 
“People do want to tip,” he said. “They actually feel uncomfortable when they get out of the car and don’t tip the driver.” 
In a statement sent to CNNTech, Uber said that it has “not seen the proposal.” 
“[We] look forward to reviewing it,” Uber said, adding that it is “always striving to offer the best earning opportunity for drivers and we are constantly working to improve the driver experience.” 
Uber said that’s the reason it has partnered with IDG, an affiliate of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union, to make sure its policies support drivers. IDG is the only organized group of drivers that meets regularly with Uber management to advocate for drivers. 
It will be some time before drivers start seeing any benefits of Monday’s announcement. The TLC said it will propose the rule by July. It must then be certified by the NYC Law Department and publicly posted for a 30 day comment period. At that point, a final rule is posted and then voted on by the TLC board of commissioners. 
“We’ll follow this all the way through to make sure it does become a rule,” said Conigliaro.

Getting a little space in your relationship doesn't have to be a bad thing. Typically when you think of asking your partner for space, you see the end of your union in the near future. Bridging a small gap between youtwo doesn't have to be all doom and gloom. Taking a break can be a healthy refresher to reignite the flame in your relationship. Instructions 1 
Disjoin from each other's hip. If you and your sweetheart are so close that you spend every waking -- and maybe even the unawake -- hours together, adjust your routine so that you each have some down time. One of you needs to stay behind when the other has to run errands or walk the dog. Start slow so it's not such a drastic change, and see how you feel about the time apart. 2 
Work in other rooms if you're prone to spend all of your time doing everything in the same space. Instead of reading a magazine on the couch while your partner works on a late-night work project right next to you, use another room which you've designated as leisure or office space. Separating from each other in these cases will help you two appreciate spending time together when you rejoin. 3 
Reduce your communication. No matter whether you're dating or married, on the verge of a breakup, or so fresh in the relationship that it's becoming smothering, a quick way to widen the space between you two is a change in communication. If you're prone to textingyour partner every minute of the day for a play-by-play of his daily actions, reduce your communication significantly by agreeing to send a ""checking on you"" text only a couple of times a day. 4 
Go a few days without seeing each other. If you find that having physical space is the only way to keep sanity in your relationship, talk to your partner about creating that space. This may mean not seeing or speaking to each other for a few days. As much as you two may fight giving the other space, consider this the first step toward a healthy solution to your problems. You'd hate to have your good thing end because one of you smothered theother with too much attention. Respect each other's need to learn how to survive on an independent basis, and part ways temporarily for the benefit of your bond.

Share Facebook 
LOS ANGELES -- ""The Fate of the Furious"" is roaring to a record-setting global debut over the weekend even as domestic audiences showed less enthusiasm for the latest installment in Universal's long-running ""Fast and Furious"" series. 
Final numbers have yet to be released, but based on earlier estimates, the action-thriller is poised to set a new worldwide high-water mark. It is expected to pass the previous record of $529 million set by ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens."" If that happens, a large part of the credit will to China, where ""The Fate of the Furious"" has already racked up a massive $135 million in its first two days of release. It is worth noting that Chinese theaters only give studios about 25% of ticket sales, roughly half of what they receive in most major territories. 
Domestically, there are indications that a franchise centered on muscle cars and physics-defying stunts, has crested. ""The Fate of the Furious"" took in an estimated $100.2 million, an impressive result, but a steep drop off from ""Furious 7's"" $147.2-million kick-off. Heading into the weekend, most analysts expected the film would roar past the $100-million mark, instead of inch over the line. 
There are important reasons for the fall off. ""Furious 7"" served as a memorial of sorts to Paul Walker, the franchise star whose 2013 death in a car accident shattered his co-stars and many fans. This time, there wasn't the same emotional resonance. ""The Fate of the Furious"" continues the franchise without Walker, adding in series newcomers such as Charlize Theron and Helen Mirren. 
Then there was the off-screen drama. This film had to contend with reports of off-screen tension between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson that undermined one of the franchise's key selling points -- that these films are celebrations of family and brotherhood. Both stars steered clear of each other at the picture's New York premiere and Diesel's attempt to brush aside the reports of a beef between the actors left something to be desired. 
Reviews were also weaker. IndieWire's David Ehrlich labeled the film the worst of the series, while the Los Angeles Times' Justin Chang argued the franchise had jumped the shark, or in this case, the nuclear submarine. That's not to say there weren't some loud advocates. Variety's Owen Glieberman, for instance, praised the picture as a ""dazzling action spectacle."" Audiences agreed, handing ""The Fate of the Furious"" an A CinemaScore. 
Beyond Johnson, Diesel, Mirren, and Theron, ""The Fate of the Furious"" brings back franchise veterans Kurt Russell, Ludacris, Tyrese Gibson, Jason Statham, and Michelle Rodriguez. F. Gary Gray, fresh off the success of ""Straight Outta Compton,"" slid into the director's chair. 
The film follows the crew as they grapple with Diesel's betrayal and alliance with a mysterious hacker (Theron). 
Universal didn't provide a budget, but sources peg the cost at $250 million, making it the most expensive chapter in the series. Despite the rising costs, the film remains on pace to top $1 billion worldwide, making more sequels a certainty. 
Fox and DreamWorks Animation's ""The Boss Baby"" was a distant second place, bringing in $15.5 million to push the family film's domestic gross to $116.3 million. Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" nabbed third, taking in $13.6 million to push its stateside haul to a mighty $454.7 million. Globally, the fairy tale remake has soared past the $1-billion mark. 
Sony's ""Smurfs: The Lost Village"" came in fourth with $6.5 million, pushing the animated film's North American total to an anemic $24.7 million. With a $60-million budget, the third Smurfs film will need to resonate strongly with foreign audiences if it wants to make a profit. 
New Line's ""Going in Style"" rounded out the top five, earning $6.3 million. The comedy about a trio of aging bank robbers stars Morgan Freeman, Alan Arkin, and Michael Caine. It has grossed $23.4 million, nearly matching its $24-million production budget. 
Most studios steered clear of ""The Fate of the Furious,"" but there were a few brave newcomers opening in limited release.

This article is a non-exhaustive list of political achievements (and failures) of United States President Donald Trump (and also Congress ) in passing conservative legislation, advancing conservative ideals, and ""Making America Great Again"". 
When adding additional examples, please add at least one reliable source for each example for future reference. Contents Republican National Convention and 2016 election Primaries and convention See also: 2016 U.S. presidential election#Primaries and convention The National Rifle Association strongly endorsed Trump in May 2016 in one of its earliest endorsements ever, before Trump became the official GOP nominee. [1] [2] The Republican Party drafted and approved a very conservative platform in 2016. [3] Among its many provisions was very strong pro-life language that recognized the right to life of unborn human beings and condemning Planned Parenthood . [4] Historic general election victory 
Not only did Trump experience a major and historic election victory upset, winning states like Wisconsin , Pennsylvania , and Michigan , that Republicans had not won in years, but they broke other records and won in other levels of government as well. Trump Transition 
Despite not even being inaugurated, Trump made several notable accomplishments. November 2016 — In an effort to ""Drain the Swamp,"" Trump instituted a 5-year lobbying ban for potential administration picks as well as transition team members. [5] This is much longer than Barack Obama 's ban, which was for two years. [6] After Trump's election and because of his strong criticism of outsourcing, numerous businesses have specifically backed off from outsourcing jobs to foreign nations, citing Trump as either the reason or a large reason. [7] [8] [9] In June 2016, President Barack Obama told a Carrier employee at a town hall meeting that there was nothing that could be done about the trend of jobs leaving America. Less than a month after Trump’s election win, Carrier tweeted that they reached a deal with the President-elect to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indiana. Trump also motivated Ford to scrap their plans for a $1.6 billion plant planned for Mexico and instead will invest $700 million in a Michigan assembly plant creating 700 new jobs. [10] Trump picked the most conservative cabinet , at least in recent U.S. history. [11] [12] In addition, rather than picking establishment Washington RINOs with worthless governmental experience in the capital city , Trump chose an unorthodox cabinet of true conservatives, small-government proponents, and outsiders. [13] [14] Additionally, Trump nominated David Friedman —one of the most pro- Israel figures in the entire world—as U.S. ambassador to Israel (which other Republicans likely would not have done), [15] [16] and he ordered all of Obama's ambassadors to leave by Inauguration Day. [17] [18] December 2016 — In foreign policy, even before being inaugurated, Trump broke decades of leftist policy instituted by liberal Jimmy Carter by answering a phone call from the president of Taiwan , which showed he is able to stand up to the ""People's"" ""Republic"" of China . [19] [20] December 2016/January 2017 — Trump criticized Boeing and Lockheed Martin for selling the U.S. overpriced weaponry (including the failed F-35 Lightning II program), and he criticized Boeing for planning an extremely overpriced new Air Force One . [21] After criticizing Boeing over Air Force One and meeting with its executives, the company's CEO assured Trump that the new plane would not be over budget. [22] January 2017 — Trump stopped the GOP-controlled House from changing the House Ethics Oversight panel rules after tweeting against the change. [23] While the panel does have problems that the proposed change would address and many fake MSM news surrounding it, [24] Trump reminded the House to focus first on helping the American people rather than themselves. Due to Trump's election, U.S. generals in Iraq fighting the Islamic State began taking greater freedom to conduct operations in the way they saw fit. [25] As U.S. President Trump being sworn in, January 20, 2017. 
Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017, giving one of the strongest inauguration addresses in American history. [26] [27] [28] His first bill signed as president was to allow retired general and Defense Secretary nominee James Mattis to be confirmed. [29] Trump had a very busy and productive first week, undoing Obama's legacy and instituting conservative executive orders. [30] [31] [32] He made a large impact by his 50th day in office. [33] 
Due to his promotion and support of conservative, America First [34] policies, President Trump faced large opposition from the left, including from within the government bureaucracy. [35] [36] (The fact that members of the Deep State have grown visibly scared of reports stating such confirms this view. [37] ) As a testament to the deep opposition and hatred towards him by the left-wing, at least 217 violent protestors were arrested in Washington D.C. on Inauguration Day. [38] [39] Additionally, Senate Democrats unduly delayed Trump's cabinet nominees at historic and unprecedented proportions—by February 8, 2017, only George Washington had fewer cabinet nominees confirmed by this length of time into his presidency. [40] As in the 2016 presidential election, the mainstream media strongly opposed Trump and wrote him off as a failure early in his presidency, despite his numerous accomplishments by that time. [41] 
Congressional Republicans were more united during Trump's presidency than in any other time in recent U.S. political history. [42] Social policy Legislation signed March 27, 2017—One of the four Congressional Review bills that Trump signed into law that day repealed Obama's Blacklisting Rule , which would have required firms contracted by federal agencies to release every claim of unfair labor practices concerning them – something which would have given unionized contractors an upper-hand. On the same day, President Trump signed an executive order repealing the contracting rule. [43] Executive actions January 20, 2017—On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that would lessen Obamacare 's burden while Republicans work to repeal and replace the failed bureaucratic law. [44] [45] February 9, 2017—President Trump signed three executive orders pertaining to law enforcement. The first cracked down and strengthens the law against international crime organizations, the second deals with anti-law enforcement crimes, and third with finding a strategy for reducing crime in general, ""including, in particular, illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and violent crime."" [46] February 22, 2017—President Trump rescinded former President Obama's pro- transgender guidelines for schools receiving federal aid that are subject to Title IX . [47] A day earlier, the Trump Administration announced it would discontinue Obama's pro-transgender policies. [48] March 27, 2017—President Trump signed an executive order repealing Obama-era requirements for federal contractors, along with signing a bill that day on the same topic. [43] April 3, 2017—Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the Department of Justice to review Obama's agreements with local police departments. Sessions made this order to give back local control to police departments. [49] April 14, 2017—President Trump appointed Roger Severino, a strong defender of religious liberty , to the HHS Office for Civil Rights. [50] [51] April 14, 2017—The Justice Department dropped its lawsuit against North Carolina that alleged discrimination with its ""bathroom bill"" (filed under the Obama Administration) after a compromise bill was passed. Homosexual activists still opposed the new bill. [52] Abortion Legislation signed April 13, 2017—President Trump signed a Congressional Review bill into law annulling a pending Obama Administration regulation that would have required states to fund abortion organizations such as Planned Parenthood . [53] The Act was ""the first major national pro-life bill in more than a decade."" [54] Executive actions January 23, 2017—President Trump signed an order reinstating the Mexico City Policy , which defunded International Planned Parenthood and other organizations that promote foreign abortions. [55] [56] April 4, 2017—The Trump Administration halted U.S. funding of the United Nations Population Fund, which has links to inhumane abortion programs such as China 's one-child policy . Instead, the $32.5 million was shifted to the U.S. Agency for International Development. [57] Gun politics Legislation signed February 28, 2017—President Trump signed a bill into law (Public Law 115-8) [58] repealing a Social Security Administration rule adding mental disability determinations to the background check registry, subject to a person applying to be removed from the list. [59] [60] [61] Congress had passed a law requiring federal agencies to search their records for people who were ""mentally defective"", and the Social Security Administration had published their method of gathering names on December 16, 2016. The regulation would have added the names of disability beneficiaries who have a mental illness or are not competent to manage their own finances, potentially leading to the removal of Second Amendment rights to many perfectly competent, mentally healthy citizens. [60] [62] By signing the resolution of disapproval, the Social Security Administration cannot come up with different criteria for supplying names to the background check registry for 10 years. Executive actions Starting early in his presidency, the Trump Administration has undone Obama-era executive branch gun regulations. [63] Immigration, illegal immigration, and border security 
According to data released early in Trump's presidency, illegal border crossings decreased by 40% in the first month of Trump's presidency – a remarkable achievement, considering that illegal immigration usually increases by 10 to 20% in January and February. [64] [65] In March, illegal immigration had fallen by over 60%. [66] It was reported in April that illegal immigration levels had fallen to the lowest point in 17 years. [67] Illegal immigration dropped so much that U.S. Customs and Border Protection was able to close on of their temporary holding facilities. [68] This drop was probably due to the Trump effect . [69] 
President Trump worked to eliminate Obama's legacy of giving privileges to illegal immigrants in detention centers. [70] Legislation signed Trump signing his Jan. 27, 2017 order regarding refugees and travel from high-risk countries. Countries affected by Trump's Jan. 27, 2017 travel ban. January 25, 2017—Trump signed two executive orders. The first one included ordering the ""immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border,"" the hiring of 5,000 additional border control agents, and ending ""catch-and-release"" policies for illegal immigrants. The second order called for hiring an additional 10,000 federal immigration officers, re-establishing the Secure Communities Program and other local partnerships, making the deportation of criminal illegal immigrants a priority, directing the State Department to use leverage to ensure countries-of-origin take back illegal immigrants, and stripping federal grant money from sanctuary cities and states . [71] [72] January 25, 2017—Trump promised to investigate voter fraud in the U.S. While this appears to have only been an announcement of a future action, it shows that President Trump is serious about voter fraud. [73] January 27, 2017—Trump signed an executive order indefinitely banning the admission of Syrian refugees, suspending the overall refugee program for 120 days, suspending entry and the issuing of visas from seven failed Middle Eastern countries [74] for at least 90 days, and reducing the number of refugees allowed into the nation during the fiscal year from 110,000 to 50,000. [75] [76] [77] Additionally, Trump made clear that he would help Christian refugees, a reversal from the Obama Administration. [78] Despite criticism from leftists and non-conservatives, 49 percent of the American public supported the decision compared to 41 percent opposed, according to the ""mainstream"" Reuters, [79] and 57% percent of likely American voters supported the ban according to Rasmussen. [80] Additionally, while the leftist establishment European leaders opposed the ban, a strong majority—55% average—of Europeans support the ban, according to a poll in 10 European Union nations. [81] [82] March 6, 2017—President Trump signed a second executive order concerning the temporary suspension of refugees and others from certain high-risk countries after the first one was blocked by the courts. The second order made some clarifications and minor improvements over the first, such as exempting green card holders from the ban and excluding Iraq from it as it had developed an acceptable vetting process. [83] [84] On March 31, 2017, after talking tough against ""sanctuary cities"" and illegal immigration, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a plan to speed up the deportation of imprisoned illegals. [85] [86] On April 11, 2017, Sessions issued a memorandum to U.S. attorneys, instructing them to enforce much stricter guidelines against immigration crimes, [87] and he announced the Justice Department would hire 125 immigration judges in the next two years. [88] Late March/Early April 2017—The Trump Administration cracked down on H-1B visas in a series of actions, making it much more difficult for entry-level programmers to enter the U.S., combating corruption in the program, and making sure that Americans were not discriminated against. [89] April 14, 2017—President Trump appointed two conservatives on immigration issues to senior positions in the Department of Homeland Security. [90] Energy and environmental policy Legislation signed February 14, 2017 - Trump signed H.J.Res.41 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of a rule submitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to ""Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers"" (see ""Size of Government"" section below). [91] Executive actions January 24, 2017—Trump signed two orders reviving consideration for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline projects, which Obama halted due to supposed environmental concerns. [92] On March 24, 2017, the Trump Administration approved the Keystone XL Pipeline. [93] January 24, 2017—In addition to the above, Trump signed three other orders, one requiring the United States Secretary of Commerce make a plan within six months mandating all new or improved pipelines be made with American steel, another order requiring every federal agency to streamline manufacturing regulations, and the third allowing fast-track approval for important infrastructure projects. [94] March 18, 2017—The Trump Administration forced the G-20 to remove any mention of climate change from its joint statement. [95] [96] (See ""Foreign policy"" section below) March 28, 2017—President Trump signed a major executive order repealing several Obama-era environmental regulations unfavorable to coal. In addition to this, the order started an immediate review of Obama's Clean Power Plan, help create American energy jobs, bring American energy independence by stimulating domestic energy production, and giving authority back to the states. [97] [98] Economic policy Legislation signed Executive actions February 3, 2017—Trump signed an order directing Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, upon his confirmation, to plan changes to the Dodd-Frank bank regulatory law in order to cut much of it. [99] [100] Trade Legislation signed Executive actions January 23, 2017—Trump signed an order which withdrew the United States from the globalist Trans-Pacific Partnership . [101] March 18, 2017—The Trump Administration forced the G-20 to remove its opposition to protectionism and its support for free trade from its joint statement. [102] [103] (See ""Foreign policy"" section below) March 31, 2017—President Trump signed two orders. The first order instituted a crackdown on violations of anti- dumping laws and help to officials to collect penalties already owed to the U.S. The second order ordered a report by the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative on the causes of the U.S. trade deficit due within 90 days. [104] [105] Foreign policy President Trump being briefed on April 6, 2017 concerning a military strike on Syria. 
President Trump was observed early in his presidency to have adopted a strong foreign policy. [106] This was as opposed to Barack Obama's foreign policy. [107] As the North Korean vice-foreign minister stated, Trump's foreign policy was ""more vicious and more aggressive"" than that of Barack Obama. [108] Fox News reported that the Trump Administration has adopted a more critical stance toward the United Nations than the Obama Administration. [109] Legislation signed Executive actions February 3, 2017—After Iran tested a ballistic missile in apparent violation of a UN Security Council resolution, the Trump Administration instituted unilateral economic sanctions against 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies. [110] [111] March 2017—After the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia authored a destructive and anti-Semitic [112] [113] report against Israel , the report and agency were strongly criticized by the United States and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley , and the executive director of the commission resigned in response. [114] [115] On March 18, 2017, the Trump Administration successfully forced the G-20 to remove its opposition to protectionism and temper its support for free trade , [102] [103] and any mention of climate change [95] [96] from its joint statement. Later, in April 2017, the Trump Administration refused to sign the G7 joint statement because the other nations could not agree to include support for nuclear and fossil fuels without support for the Paris climate agreement. The G7, thus, went without a joint statement. [116] [117] April 6, 2017—After the Syrian government used chemical weapons on its people, President Trump ordered a one-time airstrike against a Syrian air base, firing 60 cruise missiles at it. [118] The U.S. destroyed about 20 Syrian jet planes and caused extremely heavy damage on the base. [119] Defense Secretary James Mattis stated the attacks destroyed 20% of Syria's operational aircraft. [120] As even the New York Times reported, Trump's action was a show of U.S. strength, and it was in stark contrast to Obama, as Trump used surprise and speed in the attacks. [121] World leaders supported the strong action. [122] This was the first direct military action the U.S. took against the Assad regime. [123] MOAB, the ""Mother Of All bombs"" April 13, 2017—Under the increased autonomy President Trump have to his generals, [124] the U.S. dropped a GBU-43B (also known as MOAB or the ""Mother Of All bombs""), the largest non- nuclear bomb in existence at 21,000 pounds on a complex of Islamic State tunnels in Afghanistan . Although tested in 2003, the bomb had never been used in combat before. [125] It was estimated to have killed 36 ISIS fighters, [126] including ISIS commander Siddiq Yar. [127] Size of Government 
President Trump and Congress spent much time rolling back regulations, particularly those created by Obama. [128] [129] In the first six weeks of Trump's presidency, over 90 regulations were repealed, whether through executive orders, Acts of Congress, or other means [130] [131] — clearly keeping his promises. [132] He has successfully made use of Congressional Review numerous times to roll back Obama-era regulations—even more than expected. [133] [134] Prior to Trump's presidency, the Congressional Review Act had been used only once successfully, sixteen years prior. [135] Legislation signed February 14, 2017—President Trump signed a bill into law repealing an Obama Era relation requiring energy companies to disclose financial transactions with foreign governments. [91] [136] [137] February 16, 2017—President Trump signed a bill into law blocking the ""Stream Protection Rule,"" an environmental regulation. [138] [139] March 27, 2017—President Trump signed four bills undoing Obama-era regulations. [133] [140] Two of those bills rolled back federal education regulations. [141] March 31, 2017—President Trump signed another bill undoing an Obama-era regulation, giving the power back to the states to expand drug testing for unemployment benefit applicants. [142] April 3, 2017—President Trump signed a bill reversing an Obama-era FCC privacy regulation applicable to internet service providers. The FCC had adopted the rule to fill a gap created by a court case which ruled that the FTC did not have jurisdiction to extend its privacy rule over internet service providers because they were regulated by the FCC. The new law repealed the FCC rule and prohibits the FCC from enacting a replacement for 10 years without giving the FTC jurisdiction to regulate internet service providers' privacy practices. [143] Part of yet another series of bills undoing other Obama regulations. [144] Executive actions January 20, 2017—On its first day in office, the Trump Administration ordered a regulatory freeze on all federal governmental agencies. [145] On Inauguration Day, 2017, the Trump administration instituted a federal hiring freeze. [146] On January 23, 2017, Trump signed an executive order instituting the hiring freeze, from which the military was exempted. [147] On April 12, 2017, the hiring freeze was replaced with a plan to restructure and shrink the executive branch. [148] [149] January 30, 2017—Trump signed an executive order that requires two federal regulations must be eliminated for every regulation created. [150] [151] [152] February 3, 2017—President Trump signed a memorandum directing the United States Department of Labor to review a regulation signed by Obama set to go into effect. [153] February 24, 2017—President Trump signed an executive order requiring every federal agency to create a ""regulatory reform task force"" to find unnecessary, burdensome regulations to repeal. [154] This order was called ""the most far reaching effort to pare back U.S. red tape in recent decades."" [155] February 28, 2017—President Trump announced that he did not plan on filling numerous government positions he considered unnecessary. [156] According to one source, about 2,000 positions were vacant, and most of them were likely included in this list. [157] As of April 4, 2017, President Trump did not make a nomination for nearly 500 positions requiring Senate confirmation. [158] March 13, 2017—President Trump signed an executive order to perform an audit on every executive branch agency in order to reduce spending and waste and improve services. [159] [160] [161] Military Legislation signed Executive actions January 27, 2017—Trump signed a memorandum to begin the expansion and rebuilding of the U.S. military. [162] [163] February 3, 2017—The Trump Administration and Lockheed Martin reached a tentative deal that would purchase 90 F-35 jet at the lowest price in the program's history. [164] Proclamations January 20, 2017—The day he was inaugurated, Trump instituted a national day of patriotism for the country, [165] and a few days later Trump officially designated his inauguration day the National Day of Patriotic Devotion . [166] [167] January 22–28, 2017— National School Choice Week , as proclaimed by President Trump [168] Other On January 5, 2017, the U.S. House passed a motion condemning Obama's allowing a leftist anti-Israel resolution to pass in the UN. [169] [170] Additionally, Trump voiced his strong support for Israel during his transition. [171] [172] January 20, 2017—On the day he took office, Trump returned the bust of UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the Oval Office that Obama removed when he took office. [173] He also accepted the United Kingdom 's offer to re-loan the second identical bust of Churchill, which Obama removed and returned after the first loan expired. [174] January 28, 2017—Trump signed an executive order banning administration officials from lobbying their federal agencies for five years, as well as banning them for life from lobbying foreign nations and political parties. [175] [176] January 30, 2017—Trump showed he would not tolerate incompetent leftist administration officials when he fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates (a left-wing Obama holdover) when she refused to defend his refugee and immigration ban executive order. [177] [178] Trump emulated Ronald Reagan 's firing of the striking PATCO workers in 1981 by doing so, [179] contrary to the mainstream media spin. [180] That same night, Trump replaced the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (another Obama holdover) with a more competent official who had a reputation for enforcing immigration laws. [181] [182] March 10, 2017—Conservative attorney General Jeff Sessions asked the 46 remaining U.S. attorneys appointed by Obama, arguably the most left-wing president in U.S. history, to resign. [183] [184] One of those U.S. attorneys was the failed Zachary Fardon, who was lax in his prosecution of gun crimes (Sessions directed the Justice Department to increase prosecutions on gun-law violations and to reinforce harsh sentences for such). [185] When one of those attorneys, Preet Bharara, refused to resign (likely for political gain), he was fired. [186] March 21, 2017—President Trump signed a bill into law not only funding NASA , but setting a goal of having humans visit Mars ""in the 2030s"" and potentially colonizing another planet. [187] The bill also funded the agency, the first time such a bill was signed into law in seven years. [188] Non-legislative or policy achievements Trump has been bold enough to meet with conservative, right-wing figures who stand boldly for small government and conservatism, unlike many other Republicans. For example, he met with Alex Jones , becoming the first president to have ever met with Alex Jones (the meeting occurred during the campaign). [189] Also, Trump has had very strong relations with Nigel Farage of the United Kingdom Independence Party ., [190] [191] Trump has stood up to political correctness and the left-wing consensus in numerous aspects, most notably for rejecting political correctness and communicating directly to the public rather than the mainstream media . Also, Trump has been bold in rejecting the term ""happy holidays."" January 20, 2017—Trump became the first president to say ""radical Islamic terrorism"" in his inaugural address. [28] [192] January 27, 2017—Vice President Mike Pence became the first vice president in United States history to speak at the annual March for Life march in Washington D.C. [193] [194] Additionally, Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway also spoke at the event, and Trump himself strongly expressed his support for the march. [195] [196] March 1, 2017—The Trump Administration played a large role in successfully helping prevent CIA officer Sabrina de Sousa from being extradited to Italy. [197] President Trump and his administration have not been afraid to criticize the left-wing Obama Administration for its failures, such as its failed and broken ""red line"" promise concerning the Syrian Civil War . [198] The courts Supreme Court President Trump announcing his nomination of Gorsuch, January 31, 2017. 
On January 31, 2017, Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court . [199] [200] The nomination was well received by many conservatives. [201] [202] Others, however, most notably Andrew Schlafly , disagreed with the nomination due to concerns about Gorsuch's position on abortion. [203] [204] The Senate ultimately confirmed Gorsuch on a vote of 54–45, even though the GOP was forced to initiate the nuclear option and lowering the vote threshold to overturn a filibuster for Supreme Court nominees due to Democrat obstructionism. [205] Gorsuch assumed office on April 10, 2017. [206] Trump and the stock market 
With expectations that Trump's election victory would cause the markets to plunge, the Dow Jones Industrial Average actually performed very strongly, closing at the highest level it had ever reached in history after the second day. [207] It is rare for the stock market to rise immediately after a U.S. presidential election regardless of the winner. [207] The stock market had its best week in five years due to optimism of a Trump presidency. [208] 
Trump was very busy in his first week and showed he was serious about his campaign promises. This caused the stock market to increase, and the Dow Jones passed 20,000 points for the first time in its history. [209] [210] On March 1, 2017, the day after Trump made his first address to a joint-session of Congress, the stock market rose dramatically again, with the Dow Jones passing the 21,000 mark for the first time in history. [211] [212] [213] Donald Trump's victories over the liberal media establishment See also: Fake news and Liberal media Donald Trump helped further discredit the mainstream media due to his repeatedly challenging their honesty and by demonstrating that their predictions regarding his candidacy were repeatedly false. Americans who trust the media is at 32%, an all time low, according to the Gallup organization. [214] Additionally, between the 2016 election and late January, trust in the media fell from 21 to 15 percent among Trump voters, and even among Clinton voters it fell from 57 to 51 percent. [215] Donald Trump's humor has cut down leading media figures to size. He told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that if Megyn Kelly didn't repeatedly attack him, her audience would be even smaller than Blitzer's. When asked by George Stephanopoulos what his biggest mistakes were on the campaign trail, he pointed that Stephanopoulos has regrets too and pointed out his donation to the Clinton Foundation. [216] At an hour-long press conference on February 16, 2017, Trump repeatedly criticized the press as biased and ""so dishonest ... out of control."" [217] On February 17, 2017, Trump tweeted: ""The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!"" [218] On February 24, 2017, President Trump excluded several liberal media organizations from attending a press briefing. [219] [220] Donald Trump's establishment of a massive direct line to the public via social media 
Via Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, Donald Trump has established a massive direct link to the American public which is unfiltered by the mainstream media. His social media audience is about 45 million people. [221] Donald Trump's association with conservative media 
Rather than associate with the leftist mainstream media, Trump has associated himself with the conservative media , particularly Fox News . [222] He also became the first president to have ever met with Alex Jones (the meeting occurred during the campaign). [189] Failures January 31, 2017—President Trump announced he would keep a 2014 executive order signed by former President Obama that gave protected status to homosexual employees of the government and federal contractors. [223] [224] Additionally, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner reportedly derailed a proposed executive order protecting religious liberty at the same time. [225] However, supporters of homosexual privileges claimed that a March 27, 2017 order, which repealed much of Obama's 2014 executive order, went against Trump's statement to keep the 2014 Obama order (which, if true, would annul this supposed failure). [226] February 2, 2017—Trump stated that building new settlements in the West Bank ""may not be helpful"" to achieving peace in the Middle East , and he appeared to shift his formerly strong stance on moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem as he had previously stated. [227] President Trump did not sign an executive order ending ""no gun zones"" on schools early in his presidency as promised. [228] February 2017—Despite enacting a crackdown on illegal immigration, [229] President Trump announced he would keep DACA, which basically allows illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to stay. [230] President Trump and congressional Republicans did not repeal and replace ObamaCare immediately or quickly as promised. [231] They failed to agree on or pass a replacement bill for ObamaCare as a part of 2017 budget reconciliation. They withdrew the bill to avoid losing a vote on the House floor. [232] [233] This may not have been a total failure, as polling indicated that only 17% of Americans supported the bill, [234] and its passage would have likely led the GOP to an electoral failure in 2018. [235] Some commentators have stated that Trump used this failure in order to further his agenda in the long run, [236] and Trump himself made clear he was not finished with the issue. [237] As of early April 2017, several Obama-holdovers still hold their positions in the Trump Administration with little to no indication of leaving. [238] [239] As of March 9, 2017, President Trump has not fired Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen , who targeted conservative groups under the Obama Administration. [240] Trump also stated he had no plans on asking FBI director James Comey to resign. [241] In April 2017, President Trump stated he had chosen not to label China a currency manipulator, contrary to a campaign pledge. [242] This action is disputable as a failure, as he said he changed his mind ""because he now believes that China hasn't been manipulating its currency for months and because labeling Beijing a manipulator might jeopardize his talks with the Chinese on confronting the threat of North Korea."" [243] Trump also changed his mind regarding the Export-Import Bank of Washington .

Eating out is one of my favourite pastimes. Actually eating full stop. Combine that hobby with cruising, and I’m as happy as a pig-in-mud. 
I’ve written several reviews about eating on cruise ships; at specialty restaurants, the ‘buffets’ and the main dining room, but dining at the Waterfront aboard the Pacific Jewel was a little different as it was just my little poppet and myself. I was worried she’d be bored, but I really had nothing to worry about. 
(Click here for my Waterfront dining reviews on the PacificPearl and Pacific Eden ) 
Besides the nosh, what I really love about eating out is the company, sharing a meal with the people you love is one of life’s greatest gifts. I was looking forward to spending this bonding time with Hope as it is very rare that I get one-on-one time with each of my three girls, but would she feel the same way? 
Once again, there was a familiarity stepping into the Waterfront. There was a similar set-up on the Eden and Pearl, although not identical. 
Tip 1: Visit the Waterfront on Day 1 after you’re settled in your cabin, but the earlier the better. Book your preferred time (the crew taking you booking will give you the options available) and take the stress out wondering what time to eat dinner every night. You’ll be assigned your own table and waiters and you won’t have to wait more than a minute to be seated. It is important to stress here you aren’t bound to attend every night at the Waterfront, even if you booked your table. You might want to eat at the Pantry or Salt , order room service or just skip dinner all together. But, the polite thing to do is to give the W aterfront a quick phone call from your cabin and let them know you won’t be attending. 
Tip 2: If you want to watch a show, keep in mind the times and book dinner before or after. 
Tip 3: Port days you might be delayed in getting back, so booking a later dinner is advisable. 
Tip 4: No bookings needed for Breakfast or Dinner, but you might have to wait a few minutes. 
During our 4-night cruise, we ate breakfast twice and dinner twice at the Waterfront. Our first breakfast was unfortunately cut short after an unexpected hurl. I forced little miss to order the pancakes – I mean she had just slumbered for 15 hours so I thought she was up to eating. Seated next to us was another lovely mum and daughter duo enjoying a cruise, how serendipitous. It was also rather calamitous as no-one wants to have breakfast with a side of vomit. However, the waiters were so lickety-spit quick to clean up, our new friends hardly noticed.   I bundled her up and carried her to ou r cabin for a warm shower. 
Anyhoo, by dinner-time word had gotten to the incredible Maître d Marius Cerniauskas and the fabulous Restaurant Manager Rogelio ‘Roger the Dodger’ Mercado that Hope hadn’t eaten all day. Fawning over her and making a real fuss, Marius and Roger told Hope she could have anything her heart (and tummy) desired. Anything. Both her and I were stunned by their attention, but they both reassured us that all they wanted was for Hope to have a wonderful birthday cruise. Tentatively she asked for spaghetti bolognaise, no meat, just tomato sauce and cheese. 
I was handed a menu (Spanish was the theme of the night) and ordered the Chicken Broth and Wontons and the Coral Trout with prawn and lobster sauce, potato patty and zucchini slivers. 
The soup was perfect and I coaxed a few mouthfuls into my cherub who hadn’t eaten all day. Our waiter Toofik was impeccable and tried his best to make Hope smile and feel comfortable. 
Soon after, the biggest plate of spag bol was placed in front of Hope. Her eyes nearly popped out of her head, then immediately welled up with tears. Noticing her reaction, Toofik raced over and wondered what was upsetting her. “It’s.. too.. big! I can’t finish all this. It’s a waste of food…” and my heart just broke a little. 
“Don’t you worry little baby, whatever you can’t eat I will feed to the fishes! They will love it, so you are actually helping them!” 
Relieved, my little darling picked up her fork, twirled a long strand and started eating. First one mouthful, then another... ok good, it’s staying down… then a third. Great! Sighing a huge sigh of relief that she was finally eating and keeping it down, I could concentrate on my meal. A delicate, perfectly cooked fillet of trout was set before me, fresh and fragrant. Sublime and dainty, the fish was juxtaposed with the most delicious prawn and lobster sauce. Looking up, I asked Hope if she’d like to try some, but she was struggling with the pasta and I doubted she could eat anymore. Wasn’t I wrong! After one forkful of the fish (and her first ever taste of lobster) she moved her chair closer to mine and proceeded to open her mouth happily for the tasty morsels I was ‘aeroplane-ing’ into her little gob. Before I knew it, my plate was empty and my girl was sitting with an impish smile on her face. So, I did what mums do and finished off her leftovers. 
  
Dessert was a silky cream caramel for moi and chocolate éclairs with berry coulis for her. Very tasty and not too heavy. I think the mini éclairs were in the Pantry the next day, which is not unusual. Often you find similar or identical dishes in the Pantry - which isn’t a bad idea. 
I won’t go through breakfast as it’s very similar to my experience on the Pearl ( you can read it here ), however, our most memorable dinner was our last night on the Jewel and will certainly go down as one of those childhood memories my daughter will always look back on with happy tears. 
As we sat at our table, there was a buzz in the air and, Roger standing behind Hope, sent me a surreptitious wink. Once again the waiters and Marius Maitre D greeted us warmly. I knew something was up when I wasn’t handed a desert menu. 
Our meal was delicious and this night there was a Lebanese theme. I ordered the lamb koftas and Hope had the salmon . 

Throughout our meal, Roger entertained Miss Hope with magic tricks and made her a lovely origami flower made from tissue paper. She was having the time of her life. And then, the finale. 
The table were cleared and I saw no less than half-a dozen waiters approach, Hope was oblivious to all this and continued playing with her toy dogs. Suddenly, a huge Black Forest cake carried by our waiter emerged from the kitchen, astounding little Miss. The room erupted with ‘Happy Birthday’ as she looked around in amazement and blew out her candles. ( You can see the video here ). With glistening eyes, we thanked all the staff profusely and asked to share the cake with the other diners. 

Dining isn’t just about the food, it’s the whole experience. Long after the flavours fade from your tastebuds, what’s left is a memory steeped in colours, aromas, conversation and laughs. I was overwhelmed with the generosity and hospitality of every crew member in the Waterfront. P&O excel at making both children and adults feel comfortable and creating a relaxed atmosphere. 

The waiters work tirelessly, so please, fill out a feedback form and have their efforts recognised. I know I’m probably repeating myself, but Marius, you’re a class act and Roger, Hope still falls asleep staring at her paper-flower on her nightstand.

Amazon has developed a lot of programs over the years, some aimed at making the customer experience better, others intended to take care of its worldwide stable of authors. Unfortunately, the hush-hush nature that all book retailers and publishers have about sales figures can mean that the public doesn’t have full transparency about the process. 
One source has now broken down the information in a Data Guy-kind of way, examining the likely numbers behind Kindle Unlimited. Written Word Media’s report , while certainly based on a fair amount of speculation, has some solid math behind it. Their take on it examines whether or not KU subscriptions are good for reading consumers, as well as whether or not authors actually stand to benefit from the exclusive requirements that go along with listing their books through KU. 
Backing up, Kindle Unlimited is not to be confused with other programs like Prime Reading or merely KDP Select. Listing a book in KDP Select is certainly a requirement for putting it in Kindle Unlimited, but not for Amazon choosing to enroll a book in Prime Reading. Customers must pay a $9.99 per month subscription fee to read the one million-plus titles in Kindle Unlimited, and authors must sell their books exclusively on Amazon in order to put their books in front of those paying readers. 
Written Word Media broke down how many subscribers there might be, and correlated that to the results of their own survey, which resulted in a highly educated guess as to how many books KU subscribers actually read in a month. For the full breakdown of their discovery, check out their report here . But a few eyebrow-raising data points include: 
• It’s likely that there are 2.5 Million active readers enrolled in KU. • KU readers read more books and review books at a higher rate. • 77% of KU subscribers go on to purchase books outside of the program. • 60% of the best selling titles on the Amazon paid charts were enrolled in KU. • 88 of the top 100 romance books on the bestseller charts were enrolled in KU. 
So is exclusivity–and therefore Kindle Unlimited readers–a good thing for authors? There are strategies that can make it very lucrative as a marketing and visibility tactic, and is something that authors should consider. As for customers, membership depends solely on how much value you get from the subscription fee. If you don’t read enough to justify the ten bucks a month, perhaps not. If you do devour your books, you certainly have a lot to choose from. Mercy Pilkington ( 2078 Posts )

Jim O’Sullivan told Construction News that early forecasting of supply chain capacity estimated that £4bn of capital work could be carried out on the UK’s strategic roads from 2020, up from the £2.9bn expected to be spent in the final financial year of the Roads Investment Strategy (RIS). 
Mr O’Sullivan said the £4bn was an estimate at present, describing it as “just a mark on the wall”. But he added: “When I talk to the supply chain they think they can deliver £4bn a year.” 
According to Highways England’s latest delivery plan, the £2bn spent in 2016/17 on capital projects will grow to £2.9bn in 2020. 
Mr O’Sullivan said that, depending on the government’s future spending commitments, the £4bn figure for the investment plans beyond the current programme was realistic. 
“It is not a massive step up,” he said. “It definitely looks like something our supply chain can deliver, and talking to senior people within our supply chain they think this is reasonable.” 
The comments come in the wake of a National Audit Office report into the RIS. 
The report revealed at least 16 projects posed a risk to value for money and were being reviewed by Highways England and Department for Transport, with options including cancellations, delays, design changes or merging of projects. 
Mr O’Sullivan said the report was “balanced and objective” and raised issues that Highways England needed to address. 
The organisation is currently looking at re-profiling work along regional corridors to ensure the proportion of RIS projects started in its final year is reduced. 
Mr O’Sullivan used the example of the road network from Peterborough to the coast, across which seven projects are all scheduled to start in 2020. 
He said: “If we start the first scheme when we are supposed to start the first scheme and finish the last scheme when we are [supposed] to finish the last scheme, we can rearrange all of the schemes in between to minimise congestion and optimise the supply chain.” 
Highways England’s proposals would see 10 projects brought forward and nine pushed back from their current start dates. 
This month Highways England is hosting an event with suppliers in which it will outline early plans on what the organisation’s planned Routes to Market framework might look like. 
Mr O’Sullivan also said the organisation is looking to adapt its procurement model from the current “one size fits all” approach used on RIS 1 so far. 
He confirmed that some of RIS 2’s biggest projects would be procured outside of the framework, and that the new agreement would do away with mini bids. 
Highways England is also assessing whether to adopt an alliancing model for its smart motorways programmes. 
Mr O’Sullivan said those currently on Collaborative Delivery Framework (CDF) would not necessarily be guaranteed a spot on the new framework and he expected to see new entrants enter the running. 
In February Construction News revealed that only £2.7bn had been spent on roads projects through CDF, including only £36m through lot two for projects under £50m. 
Mr O’Sullivan said lot two had been squeezed as a result of the increase in size of Highways England’s renewals programme. 
“I think it is fair to say we thought lot two would be a lot bigger than [it now is],” he said. 
“What we need to do is forecast work more effectively – perhaps the biggest issue last time round was the forecasting of work, but hindsight is great.”

My personal review and first impression on make up products from Rucy’s Vanity Cosmetics. Also a giveaway at the end of the post!

Rucy’s Vanity is a cosmetics brand that offers a wide range of high quality Korean skincare and cosmetic products for both men and women. It is a FDA approved Philippine brand but their products are 100% made in Korea, manufactured with its affiliated company – Derm Plus Korea Co., Ltd. Rucy’s Vanity initially targets budget-conscious Filipino consumers, which value both affordability and quality of their skincare and cosmetic products.
Now, Rucy’s Vanity are generous enough to send me some of their face make up products to try; namely, Auto Eyebrow Pencil, Gleamy Lavish Waterproof Mascara, Liquid Eyeliner, Lip & Cheek Tint and a Two-Way Cake .

Below are my first impression review on each of the products.
1. Auto Eyebrow Pencil Packaging is simple and clean that’s mainly black with white lettering. I personally like the spin-to-pull-up applicator because it’s easy to use. You can draw mini strokes on your eyebrows that needs to be filled in. I just wish it came with a spoolie on the other end, but overall its a nice product that I would definitely see myself using more!
2. Rucy’s Vanity Gleamy Lavish Waterproof Mascara , 7ml It is said to be hypo-allergenic, sweat resistant and water-proof mascara. It would be nice if i was able to try it while swimming so I could really tell how waterproof it is but I really like how it makes my lashes appear longer than normal after a few coats. It also doesn’t feel heavy in the eyes which is a thumbs up for me!
3. Rucy’s Vanity Liquid Eyeliner , 7ml It comes with a dip brush applicator which is honestly what i’m not used to. I’ve been using brush pen type of eyeliner ever since so it was kind of hard for me to apply this but I manage nevertheless (as you can see in the video below). If you’re used to a dip brush type then this is perfect for you. Its long lasting and
a water-proof eyeliner with deep black pigmentation that last whole day without smudging!
4. Rucy’s Vanity Lip & Cheek Red 8ml This one’s very pigmented! You might want to put a little of the product first because you don’t want to walk with tomato cheeks down the streets, do you? A little goes a long way. You can always add more product to get your desire color. On the lips though I find it too sticky for my liking. I prefer to use it more on my cheeks. Size is perfect for carrying everyday because its small (but not super small) and it doesn’t occupy so much space in your bag/purse.
5. Two Way Cake SPF 35 PA ++ 12g A 2-in-1 product that combines the goodness of foundation and powder in one with added protection from UV rays. It is said to be whitening and non-cakey but I can’t tell just yet because I haven’t wore it out that much. I’ll update you for sure but so far it does make your face matte and look flawless. This is perfect for travel since it’s a foundation and powder in one. Available in 2 shades – #21 Natural Beige and #23 Dark Beige. I have the #21 shade and it was good for my skintone. Maybe add a little bronzer if you want more depth in your face. It also comes with an applicator (perfect for touch ups) and I love how the packaging has a mini divider between the product and the applicator. I personally like to use a brush when applying this though.
I hope you find this helpful. I also made a video on my Youtube channel using these products! Tell me what you think and subscribe if you haven’t already!

So we have about 66M TEASER #1 (NOT A FULL TRAILER like other movies that are being compared) views in EASTER, which is a family holiday.
Also, give this trailer time and let's see how many views it will end up.
Honestly, these aren't great numbers. It's a good trailer for Star Wars fans, but it doesn't have that wow factor, that ""holy **** you have got to watch this!"" moment that captures the zeitgeist. I would be shocked if The Last Jedi wasn't a much better film than Thor: Ragnarok, but purely as a trailer, the Thor one is better. It has the perfect Led Zeppelin song, suggests a compelling reversal of the usual Thor storylines (hammer broken, forced to fight as a gladiator), and one really great moment that reminds everyone that this is a character they like.
Star Wars will of course be fine, but maybe the marketing team should take note that once the nostalgia factor and the ""new Star Wars!"" thrill wears off, people come back for the characters. the TLJ trailer was cerebral and intriguing, but it didn't have the emotional impact that really connects with general audiences. A BB-8 joke or a fun Poe and Finn moment would really go a long way here.
Your comparing Thor to StarWars? out of all the competition TLJ has this year thor is about the last one id ever be worried about.
if i recall the First TFA trailer didnt break any records. it was the last one that blew everyone away.",,http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrVYtS81llTP.IRiKX6mVzmeBmdhGMi7hoi7aboiXFvJc4JHwDSklJLLZpEwTl1GVzQguZFTrFct.eQRSbwagf4O4VN8klMSAznOBwnmaTczA--,8d6de8f8bf0a697ed4152120e792f453101f2fc6,boards.theforce.net,http://boards.theforce.net/data/avatars/m/1383/1383215.jpg?1401037332,http://boards.theforce.net/forums/star-wars-the-last-jedi-ix-spoilers-allowed.10900/,Star Wars: The Last Jedi &amp; IX - Spoilers Allowed | Jedi Council Forums,US,56019.0,0,theforce.net,19,Discussion - Let`s talk about Trailer #1 | Page 146 | Jedi Council Forums,0.0,discussions,24,[],[],[]

Academia’s longstanding liberal bias has only hardened after last November’s election sent Donald Trump to the White House, a Post review of more than 200 colleges’ commencement plans reveals.
“It is a reflection of orthodoxy, as well as a fear of disturbance,” said John O. McGinnis, a law professor and campus speech analyst at Northwestern University. “Students realize that they can push the administration around.”
Just four colleges have asked members of the Trump administration to speak at graduation this year. But at least 14, from Columbia University to Stanford, plan to give Obama administration officials like Joe Biden, Valerie Jarrett, John Kerry and Eric Holder honorary degrees and speaking slots.
Only Trump himself, Vice President Mike Pence and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are set to appear at college graduation ceremonies.
Compare that to 2009, the first year of the Obama administration, when 14 Cabinet members and staffers were so honored, according to CampusReform.com. President Obama gave three commencement addresses that spring.
Trump, whose sole commencement appearance will be at evangelical Liberty University on May 13, did not receive the traditional invitation from University of Notre Dame that five of the last six presidents have accepted in their first year in office.
Instead, Pence will appear at the Catholic college, despite a growing campus protest against his visit.
Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Elizabeth Warren have two invitations each, and Sen. Bernie Sanders has three, including a speech at CUNY’s Brooklyn College.
The college watchdog group FIRE, which tracks protests against campus speakers, saw a sharp spike in commencement controversies in 2013 and 2014, when right-leaning guests like Dr. Ben Carson and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice were forced out of commencement roles — and colleges learned their lesson.
“Many schools have begun to invite less controversial commencement speakers, and a lot of schools now have internal speakers only,” said FIRE’s Ari Cohn.
The University of Michigan announced in March that it would abandon its commencement speaker tradition this year.
Twenty colleges The Post reviewed are hosting current and former Democratic elected officials, including Howard Dean, Rep. John Lewis and Sens. Kamala Harris, Tim Kaine, Cory Booker and Tammy Duckworth.
But only 10 of the schools are hosting Republican senators and governors — nearly all of them, like former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, political moderates.
“The atmosphere of orthodoxy is now being enforced by violent or at least unpleasant protests that discourage viewpoint diversity,” said McGinnis, pointing to demonstrations that silenced right-leaning speakers at Claremont McKenna College and Middlebury College in the last two months.
Cohn concurred.
“What we are seeing is a demand for ideological purity in totality,” he said. “Not only an increasing unwillingness to listen to a speech you might disagree with, but an unwillingness to allow anyone else to listen to people you disagree with.”

Contact: {hnw-categories} Acquisitions & Hotel Openings Coming Up In The May Online Hotel Business Review Feature Focus Eco-Friendly Practices: The Value of Sustainability The hotel industry continues to make remarkable progress in implementing sustainability policies and procedures in their properties throughout the world. As a result, they continue to reap the benefits of increased profitability, enhanced guest experiences, and improved community relations. In addition, as industry standards are codified and adopted worldwide, hotels can now compare how their operations measure up against their competitors in terms of sustainable practices and accomplishments. This capacity to publicly compare and contrast is spurring competition and driving innovation as hotels do not wish to be left behind in this area. Water management and conservation is still a primary issue as population growth, urbanization, pollution and wasteful consumption patterns place increasing demands on freshwater supply. Water recycling; installing low-flow fixtures; using digital sensors to control water usage; and even harvesting rainwater are just a few things that some hotels are doing to preserve this precious resource. Waste management is another major concern. Through policies of reduce, reuse and recycle, some hotels are implementing ?zero-waste? programs with the goal of substantially reducing their landfill waste which produces carbon dioxide and methane gases. Other hotels have established comprehensive training programs that reinforce the value of sustainability. There is employee engagement through posters and quizzes, and even contests are held to increase innovation, sensitivity and environmental awareness. Some hotels are also monitoring a guest?s energy usage and rewarding those who consumed less energy with gifts and incentives. The May issue of the Hotel Business Review will document how some hotels are integrating eco-friendly practices into their operations and how they and the environment are benefiting from them.

Two things distinguished Thursday’s town hall meeting in Sierra Vista from similar events being held around the country during the current two-week congressional recess. 
First, unlike other town halls, the crowd of more than 100 people was civil during brief statements by a series of presenters who highlighted concerns about education, ethics, the environment, health care and other national issues. 
Secondly, Congresswoman Martha McSally wasn’t there. 
“In contacts we have made with her office, we were told that Martha has no plans for having any town halls in Cochise County,” said Liz Lopez, a public school educator and moderator at Thursday’s gathering. 
That didn’t stop presenters from addressing their questions to an empty chair — representing McSally — on points of concern. The two-hour event was sponsored by Indivisible Cochise County, which lists 169 members on its Facebook page, and was held at Sky Island Unitarian Universalist Church. 
McSally held a town hall in Sahuarita in February. 
Lopez said she would question why McSally voted in favor of Betsy DeVos as the Secretary of Education, noting that her appointment by President Donald Trump put the future of public education in jeopardy. Lopez said that it took years of extensive education and training to become and retain her position as a public school educator, while DeVos “...has absolutely no education, training, or experience to qualify her for the position.” 
“Donald Trump’s agenda to privatize education has set us up to fail,” Lopez said. 
She was followed by Margaret Case, an attorney and Palominas resident, who said it’s “jaw-dropping” that the president “... has no ethics.” 
“We’ve become like a Third World country that is being run to the benefit of a single family,” Case said. 
She outlined a series of transactions between foreign governments and Trump businesses, including an event attended by the president at a newly-opened hotel in Washington, D.C. 
“I would ask Martha McSally about all the ethical problems,” Case said. “We still haven’t seen the president’s tax returns and she voted in favor of a bill that makes it so we may never see them.” 
Local environmental activist Tricia Gerrodette said she wanted to know where the congresswoman stood on clean air and water. Gerrodette urged McSally to join a bipartisan committee of lawmakers that is meeting regularly on Climate Change and what can be done to address the problem. 
“She has the right background. She’s got a degree in biology and she would be perfect on that committee,” Gerrodette said. 
Kathy Garrett, a nurse, questioned whether McSally believed that health care is a privilege or a right. Garrett said people deserve the same coverage that elected representatives in Congress receive. 
“We know that the ACA [Affordable Care Act] will be changed,” Garrett said. “What we need to know is whether Martha will work to make sure the benefits that people need and want are retained. 
“ACA doesn’t need to be replaced or repealed, it needs to be repaired.” 
Margaret DeVries, a mother of two, questioned whether McSally would vote against transparency and allow the president to continue withholding his tax returns. DeVries urged everyone to participate in an upcoming march in Sierra Vista on Tax Day, Saturday, April 15. The march is scheduled to step off on Fry Boulevard, east of Coronado Drive, beginning at 3 p.m. 
“(McSally) has chosen not to honor or engage her constituents,” DeVries said. 
Hereford resident Jo Ann Caruthers said building the border wall will destroy the habitat for numerous rare species of wildlife and will cost billions of dollars that are desperately needed for other programs and social services. 
“How will you vote?” Caruthers asked. “How can you justify billions of dollars for this?” 
Percy Childs, a retired U.S. Army combat veteran, who identified himself as a black man, said his concern is voter suppression. He pointed to voter identification laws being adopted across the country that have resulted in more than seven million people being denied a ballot, despite just 10 convictions of people attempting voter fraud. 
Before a brief recess, Lopez asked people to raise the signs they brought to the meeting. About 20 signs with various messages on national issues were held up by the audience.

Just a normal Tuesday spree for Batangueños to work, study and play along with people. Nobody ever expected that a 5.5 magnitude earthquake would literally shake the living soul in us. I was at home. Alone. I really thought there was a truck passing by the time it happened and then I found myself ducking, covering my head and hiding under the narra table Tatay made. I was not sure if I would be able to survive the wrath of Mother Nature but I was sure I would not be able to sleep peacefully that night. Aftershocks came after; I did not hold Twitter for quite a long time but because of the earthquake, I followed Phivolcs immediately. It was a serious moment for all of us living here in one of the towns in Batangas. Staring blankly and looking forward for a peaceful night, I unfolded all my stuff on the floor (4 pillows and 2 blankets, I also used my yoga mat) of our living room since my Dan and Mom were not here to make everything at ease. It was 1:30 in the morning when we experienced another aftershock and that made me wide awake. 
Wednesday to Friday became normal for all of us here even though aftershocks made us feel nervous and exhausted at the same time. 


April 8, 2017 

Truly, earthquakes come like thieves. No time. No notice. 
Since I was a teacher, even Saturdays become workdays but it didn't matter; passion is passion and teaching comes after it. 
It was 3 in the afternoon, I was inside the Heritage Center of our school where it was my temporary office with a table because I didn't want to be disturbed, it was at the very corner of the Learning Resource Center of the university I was working, I was doing different forms to be submitted days after that day but I guess Mother Nature wouldn't let me finish after all. 
All of a sudden, a 5.6 magnitude earthquake struck the whole Batangas area with us emotionless, faces shocked. I forgot my shoes because I cared for my safety, I was even pulled out by the guard to bequeath the room safely. The student assistant I was with was so scared and she panicked. All I can hear were screams from both students and faculty and employees and we all went outside the library. No tough human being can bear that thing at all.  
Because we thought it was over, we rushed inside to get out stuff. I hurriedly packed my laptop, thesis (I am a grammarian, too), forms, SHOES and then after a minute, another sudden ground shake happened. This time, it was stronger. Lights were flickering. People did what was done during earthquake drills. Duck. Cover. Hold. 
The news said it was a 5.9 magnitude earthquake.  My boyfriend happened to have a review during that time and he was the first person I looked for in the crowd. Then I remembered, I forgot my phone inside the library because I got carried away by the nerve-wracking earthquake; s ince we were not yet allowed to get inside any building, the student assistant insisted to get her stuff as well as my phone . It was my Inay who came into my mind to text first how they all are at home. It was a true survival mode. I felt cold. I saw the buildings of the school shaking, too. I was, nope, we were caught off-guard. We were all scared and thinking of ways on how to survive. 
My boyfriend and I went out of UB and walked until we reached a gasoline station near the jeepney stop, (I told him we should walk because it was a traffic jam), then I noticed it was shaking again (marquees moved, cars and jeeps and trikes swayed, people were panicking and running for their lives). My boyfriend was pretending everything's fine but I know he was scared, too. I saw debris from buildings that fell, it was like a scene from movies after an earthquake. People were piling at the middle of the street waiting for jeepneys or tricycles to get home safely, some were at the verge of crying. We walked. Fast. Some were pale, some were unable to absorb the shock the earthquake gave us. On the other side, there was an expecting mother who was stunned and just looking all over the place. Everyone on the place was dumbfounded on what happened. I was keen to my surrounding back then and store owners closed their stalls fast.  
We immediately saw a jeep and inside were passengers panicking and some, silent. 
I, on the other hand, had no other shield but prayers and the belief that God will spare us on this kind of calamity. I was staring at my boyfriend and saw his face that he wanted to go home to check if his family is also okay. I had no other choice, I was selfish that he should stay with my family but of course, he has a family who was also worried for his safety. 
There, inside the jeep, was a wake up call for all of us. There was this woman seated on my opposite side who was of different religion who kept on telling things that made another woman on my side all-panicky. The driver went to the gasoline station to pump but they were panicking that if an earthquake struck, it would explode and would kill us all because the gasoline is stored under. They were thinking about all these stuff and I controlled myself not to speak up because I might sound disrespectful of their opinions. 
Then I saw this old woman seated at the corner of the jeep, all smiles and peaceful. She was relaxed. She asked a lady beside her what happened and this lady cried but the former was still calm. She reminded us that all we could do is pray and believe that God will not let this happen to scare and lose faith in Him. She also added that this is God's wake up call. This is an overturn that we should seek Him more. 


She made me a bit tearful then, she actually made me feel better. She said she'll be crossing the sea since she'll go yet to Mindoro and all she has with her were money, bag full of clothes, pasalubong  and faith.  
I really believe God was with us, is with us everyday, every time and He is omnipresent no matter what situation we are.  
E verything went fine after what she said. And it taught me to cling on my faith further and not to become hesitant that God will help us when calamities roll. We may not be able to see God face to face but He is doing miracles in His mysterious ways. 

Thanks, G! Not just for protecting us but also for showing us your mercy and love. 

Always, Jhara xoxo

GOSHEN — Shortly after 2 p.m. on Monday, April 3, L. Stephen Brescia, the chairman of the Orange County Legislature, convened another meeting to discuss the possible creation of the Town of North Monroe.At the table were County Executive Steven M. Neuhaus, Kiryas Joel Mayor Abraham Weider, Kiryas Joel Village Administrator Gedalye Szegedin and three leaders of United Monroe — Emily Convers, John Allegro and Mike Egan.Also at the meeting were the three Orange County legislators who represent some portion of the Town of Monroe and its three villages — Michael Amo, Kathy Bonnelli and Myrna Kemnitz.No elected officials from the Town of Monroe nor representatives from the Monroe-Woodbury School District were there.Late last year, more than 500 Monroe residents living north of Route 17 petitioned the Orange County Legislature to create a new municipality that would include the Village of Kiryas Joel plus 382 acres that are included in the annexations. The request came with this offer: Do this and the voters of Kiryas Joel — with their bloc vote — would no longer be a factor in Monroe town elections.There are town elections in November: two seats on the Monroe Town Board are open as will the position of town supervisor.There are approximately 50,000 residents in Monroe; Supervisor Harley E. Doles III says that 30,000 are Hasidic.One of the interesting components of the issue is that sitting across from one another at these meetings are groups engaged in lawsuits over annexation: Convers and Allegro are founders of Preserve Hudson Valley, which is appealing a judge’s ruling permitting the 164-acre annexation from the unincorporated portion of the town of Monroe into the Village of Kiryas Joel; and Orange County officials, who also are appealing that ruling, together with a consortium of towns and villages that surround Kiryas Joel. ‘Off the record’ The specifics of the April 3 meeting and two earlier sessions have not been disclosed. As Szegedin wrote in an email exchange with The Photo News: “The substance of what was discussed at the meeting was agreed by all in attendance to be held off the record.”Egan, one of the three ranking United Monroe officials at the April 3 meeting, outlined the grassroots group’s aspirations in an email exchange with The Photo News: “As United Monroe reported on its Facebook page, while our meetings with county officials have been productive so far, we continue to work in search of fair solutions to the very thorny issues. We hope all this work results in a mutually agreeable compromise North Monroe solution and separation. But it is important that we all understand that other key stakeholders, including the school district, will also have their say long before a North Monroe petition is put to a vote at the county legislature in Goshen, and if approved there, brought to Monroe for a full public vetting and eventually a vote by its residents.” Questions The Photo News reached out to several of those at the April 3 meeting and asked the following questions:United Monroe has said it favors the creation of the town of North Monroe, but not at the expense of the additional 300+ acres. Is there a compromise afoot regarding this? Or a reconfiguration of property?Where is the discussion regarding environmental review?The lawyer for the petitioners has said no state environmental review is necessary to approve a referendum to vote on the proposal to create the new town. The counsel for the Legislature has recommend that the Legislature conduct a state environmental review as part of the preparation for the vote on the referendum, although she said there was little case law requiring that kind of deep review. She also said that the county’s Planning Department already has a vast amount of information regarding the lands outside Kiryas Joel that remains subject to annexation from the original county review. Where is this part of the discussion?If the town of North Monroe is created, what – if anything – would happen to the appeals of judge’s decision clearing the way for the annexation of the 164-acres? Would they be dropped? Continued? Settled?Is there any discussion on how the creation of the Town of North Monroe would affect the Monroe-Woodbury (and perhaps the Washingtonville) School District?What are the benefits to creating the Town of North Monroe for the residents living north of Route 17? Some answers Justin Rodriguez, the assistant to the County Executive for Communications and Media Relations, said Neuhaus believes that 300 acres is excessive, “which is why we have been fighting the annexation. The opportunity for a compromise is there, but all parties must be willing to do so.”As for who should sit at the table, “The County Executive believes that in order for this to move forward, the Legislature needs to meet with all parties involved,” Rodriguez said. “It might not be able to be coordinated at the same time, but everyone, elected officials and interest groups, should be heard.”Egan also addressed the absence of elected town of Monroe officials at these meetings:“Although other town notables who are not involved in the discussions are desperately flailing about for public or even private attention on this subject, we believe it would be counterproductive and premature to comment on the status of the North Monroe talks we’ve experienced, or comment on emails we’ve not received,” Egan wrote. “In stark contrast with the others, United Monroe tries not to be reckless with the people’s interests.“Should a win-win proposal be reached by all stakeholders,” he added, “the citizens of Monroe will have ample opportunity to discuss it and then approve or disapprove it with their votes in November.” ‘Let Monroe decide its future’ Doles is opposed to these meetings. At the April 3 Monroe Town Board meeting, he tried to add several items to the meeting’s agenda, calling for a public forum regarding the status of the North Monroe proposal. He failed to get the votes to amend the agenda.Since then, Doles has become increasing vocal — at least through emails — about the town being left out of these discussions.For instance, in an email sent out Thursday, April 13, to the county executive, he wrote:“Mr. Neuhaus, your private meetings with local elected officials while there is annexation litigation is wrong! Your meetings with United Monroe as party to annexation is wrong?“You are advancing creating North Monroe while there is still pending litigation. Annexation preserves both the school district and Monroe’s tax base. Creating (North) Monroe will raise taxes. No doubt. Removing KJ votes from Monroe elections does nothing since your friends at United Monroe’s KJ Alliance own nearly every project, development home re-sale and drop of water in Monroe. Their voters will simply replace those of KJ’s in Town elections. Then there won’t be a North Monroe and Monroe. If you do not allow for annexation you will be responsible for laying the foundation for ‘North KJ’ and ‘South KJ.’ Where will the rest of Monroe go? This does not create ‘peace’ but prevents it from ever occurring. “Open forums in Monroe are right,” he added. “Let Monroe decide its future.” Timetable The Orange County Legislature must approve a measure allowing for a permissive referendum no later than September. The referendum would allow all residents in the Town of Monroe - and that includes voters living in the villages of Harriman, Kiryas Joel and Monroe — to vote on creating the new municipality as part of town elections in November.

He finally joined in the fun Sunday night. Bird busted out of his slump with a long home run that began a perfect night in the batter's box, and Michael Pineda pitched New York past the staggering St. Louis Cardinals 9-3 for its seventh straight victory. ""That's the Bird I know,"" teammate Aaron Judge said. ""That's what he did in spring training."" Aaron Hicks also hit a homer and Judge was robbed of one by a fan in the bleachers , forcing the young Yankees bopper to settle for an RBI triple. New York chased Adam Wainwright (0-3) in the fifth and finished a three-game sweep that left St. Louis at 3-9, the worst record in the National League and its poorest start since 1988. ""It's an incredibly frustrating start to the season,"" the 35-year-old Wainwright said after his first career outing against the Yankees. ""I know Cardinal Nation is ready for me to get my act together, and I am, too."" His cap cocked to the side, Pineda (2-1) permitted two runs over seven innings in a solid follow-up to his dominant outing last Monday. The right-hander retired his first 20 batters during New York's home opener and struck out 11 over 7 2/3 innings for an 8-1 victory against Tampa Bay. The strong encore Sunday was particularly encouraging to the Yankees, yearning for a steady season from a talented pitcher who has been maddeningly inconsistent throughout his tenure with the team. ""It's important because you want him to keep going, and get some momentum,"" manager Joe Girardi said . ""He had a hard time doing that last year."" Yadier Molina 's leadoff homer in the seventh trimmed it to 4-2, but Pineda maintained his poise and retired the next three batters. ""After the second inning, I got more energy,"" he said. ""I'm working so hard to be consistent every five days."" Austin Romine and Ronald Torreyes, the bottom two batters in the order, each had a two-run double against reliever Miguel Socolovich during a five-run eighth that made it 9-2. The late outburst sealed New York's sweep of an early interleague series between two of baseball's most successful and storied franchises. Chase Headley , who also reached safely every time up, singled to start the second, and Judge hit a drive to deep right-center, where a fan reached out just next to the auxiliary scoreboard hoping to catch a home run. The ball popped out of the man's mitt and back into play, triggering a fan interference call by the umpires. Following a replay review that lasted nearly three minutes, the ruling stood and Judge remained at third with an RBI triple — even though it appeared his shot would have easily cleared the fence if not for the eager fan. ""I think that was my first career triple,"" Judge said. ""So I don't mind it."" Bird made all that moot for the Yankees when he sent Wainwright's next pitch way over the right-field wall and into the elevated bleachers for his first home run since Oct. 1, 2015, against Boston. The 24-year-old first baseman missed last season while recovering from shoulder surgery after hitting 11 homers in 46 games as a rookie in 2015. Following an outstanding spring, Bird began the night 1 for 26 this season and hitless in his past 20 at-bats. But Girardi said before the game he saw some good signs Saturday and was committed to keeping the promising young slugger in the lineup. ""My timing was messed up,"" said Bird, who went 3 for 3 with a double and a walk. ""Tonight, I really just tried to simplify and swing at strikes."" Hicks added a solo homer off Wainwright in the fifth. A BRONX TALE Minus injured catcher Gary Sanchez , the Yankees have won their first six home games for the first time since opening 7-0 in the Bronx in 1998. The Cardinals are 0-6 at Yankee Stadium since Bob Gibson and Tim McCarver propelled them to a 10-inning victory in Game 5 of the 1964 World Series. ""We just got swept. I don't have a whole lot of positive in my mind right now. Just trying to figure out all the things we can get better at,"" St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said. ""We just know there's a whole different level of baseball we have."" TRAINER'S ROOM Cardinals: 1B Matt Carpenter was hit in the bare hand by Hicks' first-inning groundout and appeared to damage the nail on his right ring finger. A trainer worked on Carpenter, who initially had blood streaming all over his hand. He remained in the game. Yankees: DH Matt Holliday (stiff lower back) sat out for the second consecutive day against his former team, denying him a chance to face good buddy Wainwright. Girardi said Holliday felt much better, however, and he would be surprised if the veteran slugger wasn't available to play Monday. UP NEXT Cardinals: RHP Lance Lynn (0-1, 5.23 ERA) faces Pittsburgh RHP Ivan Nova (1-1, 2.25) in the opener of a three-game series Monday night in St. Louis. Yankees: LHP Jordan Montgomery makes his second major league start Monday night against Chicago White Sox lefty Derek Holland (1-1, 1.50 ERA).","Bird breaks out, Yanks sweep Cards 9-3 for 7th straight",http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_0wqT7Ae5UJvzJ_c9Ah3oBLmUPfpyarcU4JAnJosmVItDV24Y6wC0cIsPGTP8On118eAM91vKtSXz6FR6i1P0_oOwe5f0wRWMOniiiYceazVJVV21BfN7QOFmw6NZX9YMA7_V66x.ZGQ--,93d1f00b1597bd4861a8d31b48224268320fafa0,www.beaumontenterprise.com,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/60/44/13/12731093/3/rawImage.jpg,http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/sports/baseball/collectionRss/Sports-Baseball-Heds-7391.php,Sports Baseball Heds,US,,0,beaumontenterprise.com,1,"Bird breaks out, Yanks sweep Cards 9-3 for 7th straight",0.0,news,0,"[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'greg bird'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'tim mccarver'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'derek holland'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'bird'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'jordan montgomery'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'adam wainwright'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'aaron hicks'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'aaron'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'mike matheny'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'lance lynn'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ivan nova'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'girardi'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'wainwright'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'michael pineda'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'rich schultz'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'matt holliday'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ronald torreyes'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'yadier molina'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'holliday'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'hicks'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'chase headley'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'bob gibson'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'adam olsen'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'joe girardi'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'pineda'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'austin romine'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'aaron judge'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'matt carpenter'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'gary sanchez'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'miguel socolovich'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'carpenter'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'gallery new york'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'new york'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'yankee stadium'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'st. louis'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'bronx'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'boston'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'pittsburgh'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'new york yankees'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'yanks'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'cardinals'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'chicago white sox'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'national league'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'louis cardinals'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'tampa bay'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'yankee'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'st. louis cardinals'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'yankees'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ap'}]"

This, of course, makes no sense. New York is insanely competitive, with a ton of turnover and a very demanding audience. A fast casual restaurant in Shaker Heights can coast for a long time, because… it’s better than the alternatives.
Thanks to marketing, the media and our culture, we spend a lot of our time comparing before we decide whether or not we’re happy.
Turn back the clock just 60 years. If you lived in 1957, how would your life compare to the one you live right now? Well, you have access to lifesaving medicines, often in pill form. You can choose from an infinite amount of entertainment, you can connect with humans all over the Earth, for free, at the click of a button. You have access to the sum total of human knowledge. You have control over your reproductive cycle. You can eat sushi (you’ve even heard of sushi). You can express yourself in a thousand ways that were forbidden then…
That’s in one lifetime.
But we don’t compare our lives to this imaginary juxtaposition. Instead, we hear two things from the media we choose to engage with: Other people have it better, way better. And, it’s going to get worse. Add to that the idea that marketers want us to believe that what we have now isn’t that good, but if we merely choose to go into a bit of debt, we can buy our way to a better outcome…
Comparison leads to frustration which sometimes leads to innovation.
More often than not, though, frustration doesn’t make us happy. It only makes us frustrated.
If a comparison isn’t helping you get to where you’re going, it’s okay to ignore it.

Morning fellow blogees and what a great weekend to reflect on the failures of the prison and probation 'reforms'. I am sure most of us would agree that 'reform' is just a pseudonym for enormous financial cuts in this time of austerity. There is no actual reform is there..nothing that could be described as an actual improvement to services. Here is a snapshot of 'reform' to the management of offenders in the community over the past 25 years from someone who has recently taken early retirement.  

Remove our professional qualification and take social work out of probation. Let's face it the Certificate of Qualification in Social Work was more representative of our job which incorporates many aspects of social work, working with mental health, drugs and alcohol, domestic violence, child protection...bread and butter of social workers. Concentrating on only criminology or even psychology is missing the major environmental factors that are in need of change. Society v individual as the cause of crime. This government would prefer to blame the individual rather than focus on failings of society. 

Creation of PSO's as opposed to fully qualified PO only. Ok I know this is contentious. I actually think there IS a role for PSO's and have worked with many in my time but it is a bit like teaching assistants in schools. Until they are accredited fully and have years of experience behind them they need close supervision and support. They should not be employed and then immediately given large caseload of low to medium risk offenders which is what happens now. It is similar to the news recently with large numbers of classroom assistants left in charge of classes. Gradual erosion of professional standards is not good for anyone. Just because you don't need a professional qualification to be an MP it doesn't mean other professions don't or do. We want to go back to the days of asking the barber to stitch a wound or pull teeth?! 

Loss of community reporting offices and day centres. Gone are the days when you knew your local area and everyone operating services there. Some staff were running services voluntarily such as football groups or groups for women on probation. It wasn't cute n cuddly social work, it was a lifeline for some people who have told me years later in the street how much it meant to them! Now service users have to travel miles to get to a central office or 'hub' which seems to be the new fangled word! 

Groupwork: groupwork rose to prominence but never replaced one to one work entirely. 2 years ago there were about 8 different groups in my area but post privatisation they have shrunk to about 4 and I am told even lower now as staff running them have left and need to train people up. Doesn't sound like progress to me. 

RAR days! Hmmmm..do magistrates really know what a RAR day is I wonder? Surely this is just basic one to one supervision or a group which is what we were doing anyway when we had the time. A trip to the jobcentre? Come on! People would be doing that anyway.. just a renaming if you ask me! 

Management. What was wrong with having one SPO managing one office! Worked for me but now TR means running around like a headless chicken supervising staff at 2 or even 3 offices and failing miserably. 

Training. If it's free book staff on, if it costs forget it! No more in house training unit. So who is doing the basics such as managing risk, working with sex offenders? Ok, CRC don't work with sex offenders! Except when it is historical! Dodgy that!  

Could go on for ever here! Anyway I'm off to mow the lawn on this sunny day and ponder the meaning of life. Back to work on Monday, early retirement doesn't mean you can't get another job but you can hopefully choose to do something a whole less stressful.


""Supervision"" rolled far more easily off the tongue in court, rather than ""rehabilitation activity requirement"", and far more straightforward to explain in terms of the Act and its practical application. I sometimes wonder whether these ridiculous changes are intended to fudge and confuse, all the easier to create an impression of something being done. What is a RAR day? I still don't know. How long does it last? If one is missed, does it require making up? Is there some mystical corner of ND that I've (easily) so far missed that shows how many RAR days have been completed on an ongoing order?


What is a RAR day? Same goes for Post Sentence Supervision. Poorly defined concepts, poorly integrated and in consequence practitioners, managers and so called businesses alike confused and uncertain. Justice Committee sensibly asks for clarity on Prison Reform lest it be the dog's breakfast that is TR.


RAR days = professionals running around like headless chickens ticking boxes and (forced to make some up if not enough are ticked), delivering meaningless interventions all so that the paymasters can get paid. Maybe this should be put in all PSRs when judges and magistrates ask for explanations as to what we do on RAR days.


Just had a bizarre dream series where CRCs had been forced to hand contracts over to Citizens Advice Bureaux, and ""community rehabilitation"" was being delivered in libraries & train station cafes by freelance ""advisors"" who were paid in cash after downloading their contact details via a laptop into a CAB mobile server mounted in the boot of a white Volvo V70.


The answer, is 'No.' No-one has noticed - including politicians, journos, etc - because no-one really gives a rats arse. Probation-as-was was always under the radar, low key, understated, modest to the point of clinically shy. On a number of occasions this blog has highlighted the path of probation's demise, from 1992 & the CJAct which turned probation into a political plaything, through the cessation of SW training in 1995/6, NOMS in 2003, Trusts in 2007 to the implementation of TR in 2013. NAPO lost its way from 2005 on as NOMS's stranglehold tightened & Trusts were hatched, with Ledger metaphorically & literally fumbling in the dark.

I've been out of the profession for some time now but I had chance to have conversations with some who are either still hanging on or more recently departed, and they have revealed shocking conditions in which people are working - bullying, incompetence, lying, no equipment, no management, no office, dismissals, people frog-marched out of offices... These are all things written about on this blog at various times, but which I've now had first-hand accounts of. It is monstrous how the privateers are behaving towards staff and clients.

One conversation was with an ex-colleague, now a senior manager, who thinks it's all just fine & dandy. They seemed well, positive, content and spoke enthusiastically about their achievements in the CRC interestingly, and without fail, that same person was named by others as a ""major local problem"" - variously referred to as a bully, a braggart who refuses to listen, rarely in the office, blames staff for everything, a liar & a fraud.

A gaping chasm has opened up... is that where the simple truth has gone? Everywhere I look these days there are several varieties of truth. Take the US strikes on Syria. 59 tomahawk missiles were fired, but that's the only fact people can agree on. US say 58/59 landed on target. Russia say 23/59. Etc, etc...So Grayling's truth is not my truth - that much I do know!


It's clearly time for a blog special on the fiasco/failure/debacle/disaster that is Interserve's Cheshire and Manchester (and Merseyside, let's not pretend that's really separate) CRC - the very embodiment of cynicism with its institutional disdain for the real needs of its client group and a venomous contempt for the professional and personal integrity of what remains of its workforce.


Off Piste I know... but you need an update on the lunacy that is Interserve and the now fabled Interchange Model....The CEO, young Mr Edwards and his now infamous blog; his updates have somehow managed to conflate the abject failure of Interserve to manage one of their contracts in their core role as facility management and subsequent loss of revenue with the service credits accrued by MCRC and CMCRC which are currently running in excess of 100 thousand pound sterling. How he manages to compare the failure to clean a toilet to a satisfactory standard with the production of an ISP that has a Risk Management Plan and good sentence plan in the same breath is bewildering at best...

He completely ignores; or if I am being kind; he cannot compute the serious high sickness rates, coupled with PSOs/POs leaving in droves... in tandem with those clueless Directors (ACOs) Interchange Managers (SPOs) who think that by cascading an email untouched or not explained sent from on high with a single note saying ""Please action"". Knowing the attachment being one of those heavy duty many-paged documents they want you to pick the bones out of and somehow implement... and you know what the coal face does... F9 Delete....  

If you can't be bothered to even try to explain in plain English what you want then it does not deserve my attention.... Off piste again with that rant but the latest offering from Interserve is that they want the flex teams (Pods, teams, units, in old money) to sort out amongst themselves, without any management oversight, no direction, no leadership, to reallocate case which may show as failing targets or cases that are 'drifting'. They want us to meet as flex team each week without any management involvement .. review their super duper Service Level Spreadsheets which are monitored by the poor old Case Coordinators (Case Admin, again in old money - there is a theme running here) and decide who should complete the ISP which is now too close to ignore as they are failing said target.  

The reason that the target is failing my dear Christopher, is because the ridiculous central focused Professional Service Centres (PSCs) are allocating new case to case managers at the start of their leave. So when they return from leave they ae faced with immediate failures.... Now the PSCs will blame the IMs (SPOs - Do keep up!!) for not completing their staffing spreadsheets which show who is available and who is not... but when the IMs have gone off sick or are trying their collective best to learn how to be facility managers (lets be honest, that is what they have turned into) who is in charge? Are the lunatics now running the asylum?...  

When I sit down and have a good old one to one with little Tommy Aikens during one of our RAR sessions (Reality = A good old supervision session in old money).. We both end up sharing the same comfort blanket to get through our day... Just another day in the life... interRUPT, interFERE, interGALACTICAL, interMITTENT but very little (inter)service..


Absolutely spot on - Mr E is far too removed to actually care about staff - on one of his visits to offices where he wanted to be viewed as ""a listener/doer/caring"" all he kept banging on about was when ""everything was working effectively then it would make life easier to be a offender manager"" we told him to come back when this was actually happening and that due to the failure of the Interserve model and the stresses associated with it, all staff were dropping like flies or hanging on by our finger nails - I'm sure this was resonated by staff in all offices he visited - the management of Interserve are like the 3 monkey's ""hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil"" - so much for their motto ""every one has a voice"" - well as long as you're saying what they want to hear!!


I don't know how Chris can carry on being so deceitful, its like he knows the service has failed and can't offer anything to the staff but instead of admitting it he carry's on spouting nonsense. I used to think he was okay when he worked for the trust, but he has turned out to be a right pillock. Both him and his wife are doing very well thank you out of interswereve.


If I could afford to leave Interserve's Manchester CRC I'd be gone today. While staff are being run into the ground by unmanageable caseloads and impossible and pointless targets and deadlines the managers - sorry I mean 'executives' and 'directors' and 'Interchange managers' - are busy slapping each other on the back for the 'progress' we're making because they've rendered the already dismal working environment even more unpleasant by shutting most of the offices and making the remaining spaces look and feel like start-up call centres done on the cheap. If there are consultants who advise cut-throat companies on how to make job conditions so miserable that everyone will leave instead of having to be paid redundancy money, they're definitely working for Manchester CRC.


I totally agree. I too work within Manchester CRC - I would so love to be able to leave but my finances at present dictate otherwise - Chris Edwards blog this week was of no surprise telling staff that he was impressed by those using Skype in order to cut down on travel expenses (not sure who these people are skyping instead of face to face contact - offenders ?). I've also been waiting (since I read it some time ago) for the ""we need to tighten our belts and not do anything to loose Interswerve any more money"" - they can't even manage a waste contract adequately.  

He also banged on about groups etc which we all know don't need half as many staff - I'm concerned and have been for some time (especially as Yvonne Thomas told the JSC that they didn't make as many cuts to staffing as they'd anticipated) that they will do so now they need to recoup their losses and nail them out of litigation (due to failed waste contract) - watch this space!! These really are bloody awful times and I totally agree that they want to shaft the experienced more expensive staff to be able to employ more niave inexperienced buggers on Interswerve contracts and T&C's whilst the exec, directors and the likes are of the belief that all in the garden is rosy - full of Interswerves waste Shit!


I too would like to leave but can't afford to, however on some days I feel the salary does not add up to the horror and stress working for interswere. They are despicable. I knew the minute I was shafted to work for them that my career was over and that I no longer could uphold the values dignity and morals to help those that are most marginalised in society.


Yes, it's like there are two Interswerve Manchester CRCs - the special magical Interswerve/Management version where just saying 'inter' five times transforms lives and everything's 'innovative' and 'exciting', and then the real one where the totally demoralised and ever-dwindling staff group are crammed into miserable call centre style offices designed to sap their will to live, while being expected to supervise sixty or seventy cases each with no resources apart from a laptop computer that only works every other day. It's Hellish, and better still it's clearly meant to be hellish so that we'll fuck off and make way for cheaper and more desperate and malleable staff.


I think Interswerve are beating the battle on that front from the comments regularly made about them on this blog, it won be long before the odd few staff that are left will leave, you can only suffer for so long. They'll keep getting paid and our lives will continue to be made miserable. Maybe the only staff left will be managers and they can deliver their own worthless piece of shit that they call the interchange model.


A little off topic but can I just stress again how much we loath and despise our clueless and morally bankrupt parasite paymasters Interserve, and how their bizarre notion that Probation staff would have the slightest interest in celebrating being a part of what they risibly try to term the 'Interserve family' only makes us hate them all the more... The 'Interserve family' might just be the most repugnant notion I've encountered in my working life....


The chief executive of the Interserve owned Cheshire and Greater Manchester CRC today warned staff that Interserve's losses in their waste business mean that we as a CRC will now have to tighten our belts! Better still, in spelling it out he detailed how we are now expected to respond to Interserve's incompetence by...being of sick less!!


And as for their 'Interchange model' - A list of words chosen purely because they start with the same five letters as 'interserve' is not a 'model', even if you have paid off a bunch of mercenary university hacks to pretend it is.


Again back to one of my previous posts, the people that are banging the Interswerve drum are Probation staff (Snr Probation officers etc ) - Chris Edwards and his cronies who are narcissists with fragile egos that believe all their own hype and who's bank balances are so much more important than the people that they trained and used to work closely with! - Interswerve have obviously seen their greed and naivety as I'm sure when the going gets tougher Interswerve will (here's hoping) will kick them to the kerb like they've done with everything and everyone else they've touched.


I too work for interswerve CGM - I agree in the fact that ""most"" but not all IM's are approachable, however quite a few now have no case manager experience (?) as they've been shafted into the role from being programme managers. 

We received an email today highlighting the fact that NPS will no longer be  loosening the shackles"" and will be rejecting breaches for whatever reason, probably only known to them - numerous colleagues of mine have already experienced breach rejections/failures due to no fault of their own but reasons that the gatekeeping NPS team decided without liaising with said case manager. 

The PSC's regularly get so many things wrong making life very difficult - the majority of staff I speak with feel that their job now entails more administrative duties due to the new model. Case loads are far to high (people have 60 - 100 cases) resulting in most staff being unable to prioritise as everything's a priority - it's a horrible feeling juggling plates like this knowing at some point you're going to drop a few (which could result in an SFO). Staff I know (I've been around quite a long time) experienced ones at that, have dropped like flies due to stress levels of holding so many cases (hearing a name and thinking 'who the hells that?', please tell me they're not on my case load).


Just the word 'Interserve' makes my flesh crawl. 'Purple Futures' was bad enough, but Interserve have now abandoned even any pretence of leading a 'partnership'. They plainly don't give a fuck about Shelter still taking our money and yet barely even bothering even to pretend to provide a meaningful 'Through the Gate' service. No one knows who 3SC are or what the fuck they even claim to do. P3 operate a criteria whereby they only provide support to clients who can demonstrate that they don't need it and otherwise it's just Interserve Interserve Interserve all the way. Better still, despite their transparent efforts to deprofessionalise our service, they seem to have some bizarre notion that we might somehow respect their filthy money-grubbing organisation and in some way be pleased or even proud to be a part of their 'Interserve family'. Their efforts to try and make us believe that they are our 'friend' or that they could give a damn about the people we work with truly make me want to vomit. Do they really not understand that as a workforce we have nothing but contempt for them and for everything they stand for? Fuck Interserve.


Seeing Interswerves ""Ingenuity at work"" signs on everything makes me feel incensed!! Through the gate staff don't even have access to NDelius so have no bloody idea who they need to contact, hence ""we"" are told that we have to make contact with TTG staff in whatever prison with ALL our custody cases, which yet again is a massive task, also part of Interswerves Appraisal objectives!!  

As part of Interswerves model we're supposed to have a ""directory of  local) services"" run by 3SC which is not fit for purpose but supposedly we use them for RAR days as they are ""supposed"" to be services that are locally commissioned by PS3 to provide CRC's services (really?) - one service on there is ""phone FRANK"" again REALLY! I'm sure courts would love to hear that we completed RAR days by phoning FRANK! - I totally agree with you it make me ill, however what makes me feel worse are the management that were previously Probation Officers that have sold their soul's to Interswerve and now appear to have no sign of professional nor personal integrity.


Well said. Interswerve are a deplorable company but always try to hide behind a made up image that they actually care. Do they seriously think that we are unable to see through their greedy bullshit. I wish they would F off and take their daft interchange model with them, they could try using it on their cleaning contracts.


Here's the thing with PF/Interserve. MCRC now has such a terrible reputation with Crown Court judges, District Judges and lay Magistrates. It really is bubbling under the surface. Directors, or ACOs in old money, have been called to account by the Recorder and District Judges for such poor quality of cases not being managed. They are rapidly loosing confidence.. So the bemused directors cobble together a very telling email to staff outlining the 'reputational damage' this is causing and people need to sort this out as a matter of absolute importance. Essentially waving a big stick.  

They, bless their poor corporate souls, fail miserably in recognising that the IT is so poor, the new PSOs are not trained, those poor sods have re located from admin, accommodation and HQ posts that were got rid of during the great run down of Trusts are now holding 70-80 cases with the most half-arsed on the job training, no idea about OASys sentence plans, RMPs, breach reports, evidence to support breaches, when to breach, HDC, ROTL etc etc etc.... Then, surprise surprise, these people leave in droves, and the cases left behind are by any standard in an absolute mess.  

The good old boys and gels who now hold nice fancy titles like Interchange Director are literally clueless completely out of their collective depths. The so called DOS (Directory of Services) to support RAR activity well it is merely just a poor quality spreadsheet that is at best described as embarrassing and at worst... well its just criminal. So what do you do when you are handed another dozen or so re-allocated cases that on inspection really does turn your blood cold? You draw a line under the past management and move forward. Sod reputational damage if it is in a unrecoverable mess, then send it back from whence it came saying not in my name... or return it to court in your name but having to expose the mess.. 

This is left at PSO/PO level to sort with that great management default phase ringing in your ears ""Just do your best"".... leadership at its very best... Yvonne T, if you happen to read this blog, I know you or at the very least your bright young things do... either hand back the keys or come down to the coal face and turn over some stones and see for yourself..

Before I had any of these presets I did a comparative test in my range which was M down to Sup Tak.
The sub tak came out noticeably ahead wide open and a big of enough difference to matter.
I suspect that is the change from 5 element to 4.
Given that the reviews are a highly subjective discussion on the lens I just feel that the 46 mm lens reflect a specific era and their universal lack of coating is another point of difference.
The trouble is in the reviews not enough people go to the trouble of specifying which one their lens is. I have developed the tendency when grabbing a lens for the day to grab the most un-coated one I have.
I don't know whether it is because the coatings are detracting from the image or whether the older lens are simply better or maybe I am a bit of a Luddite and like old stuff.
I suspect it is the coating because my 28mm of choice is a Takumar Bayonet 28mm 2.8 which I put ahead of both my M28 3.5s and equal to better than my A 28mm. Once more an uncoated lens.

What’s it about? He’s watching, waiting… and counting. The next gripping serial killer read in the DC ‘Charlie’ Stafford series, from the bestselling author of Mummy’s Favourite. Perfect for fans of Angela Marsons.
He keeps each one floating in formaldehyde to stop them from rotting. Each finger denotes a victim, tortured and butchered, their heart ripped out and discarded, replaced instead by symbols of their treachery. He sits alone admiring his trophies weekly; each and everyone of them guilty in his eyes. And now more must pay.
But who or what links the victims?
DC ‘Charlie’ Stafford is already investigating a series of escalating racist attacks and it now seems she has a vicious serial killer on her patch. With no leads and time running out, the team at Lambeth are at near breaking point.
Something has to give… and all the while he’s watching, waiting… and counting.

Review 
I really enjoyed reading The Trophy Taker. This is the second novel about DC Charlotte Stafford but is perfect to read as a standalone novel. The story is set in London this time and Charlie is a withered and serious detective. Her hair and clothes could use some improvement but there’s nothing to say about her skills, or of those of the rest of her team. They are tightly knit and it was great to see them working together and see the contributions from other team members too.
The story starts out with her troubles with Cornell Miller who carried out a racist attack on an old, kind man who’s been hiding in his house ever since. She’s vowed to protect Moses and will try her utmost but will have to divide her time chasing The Trophy Taker too. The first victim of this killer is found in a cemetery, her heart is ripped out and tossed on the ground, her ring finger missing.
I was happy to read about some real police work in this novel and thanks to this outstanding detective work suspicion falls fairly soon on not one but no less than three possible suspects. All of these men have something to hide and a possible motive. I never had a problem believing their motive. The author kept me guessing good and let me have a good time figuring it out on myself.
I wasn’t entirely surprised who the killer finally turned out to be and I knew for sure a few pages before Charlotte Stafford did, but then I really don’t need much to get on the right trail ;-). It was still entertaining to see how it all played out and how she really got on the right track, involving Cornell Miller even in her chase for the killer. She did an excellent job of letting these two storylines mix in the end.
If you like a nice police procedural novel, this novel is certainly comparable to Robert Bryndza’s series and I can definitely recommend adding The Trophy Taker to your reading list.
I received a free copy from the publisher, Aria, in exchange for my honest opinion.

I'm trying to be really careful, which means throwing back anyone with any red flag, but I really liked this guy I've been talking to. He is just so sweet, good looking, good natured, from Jamaica, which means trips to fun places. He's a nurse practitioner and a great musician- played with Ziggy Marley, which I thought would be a lie, but I checked it out, and it all checks out. He does have a college age daughter (yikes) which is good enough reason not to meet him, but I thought I'd see what happened. 
But I thought he was my age. I've always been with older men, and I wanted someone my own age this time. His profile says he's 40. Well, looking him up online, he certainly is an NP, he does work at a hospital nearby, he has great reviews- but he's 50. WHY? He hasn't lied to my face, I haven't asked his age, but the profile it makes me feel like he could either be just looking for hookups and not really be expecting to commit to someone long term and need to ever face the music, or he's someone who's all around dishonest. 
My first SO, one who originally told me he was 42 was actually 52. He also then told me that he wanted to marry me, and strung me along for 7 years. He never intended to do so. He was an all around dishonest person. But I've told ""white lies"" as well, and I don't consider myself a liar in general. Bummer. I really like this guy. I just ordered two dresses, two tops and a skirt for dates with him. I'm pretty sure those will be used for dates with someone I have yet to meet, or maybe I should just cancel the order. What do you all think? » Submitted by notsobad on Sat, 04/15/2017 - 11:56pm. 
My BFF met her last BF on POF. 
He was wonderful, said and did all the right things. He told a couple of white lies. His age was one. 
As they dated, he told more lies but in every other way he was perfect and he just seemed to really get her. 
He turned out to be a complete narcissist. His lies seemed small and unimportant and he was love bombing (look it up) her, so she was willing to look past them. 
I'm not saying this guy is the same but I wouldn't trust him if he can even be honest about his age. 
He turned his lying about his age on her. He said he was embarrassed to say that he was over 50 and single, that he felt like a total failure at relationships. Her bringing it up just reminded him of what a loser he was. She spent the rest of the night trying to make it up to him, trying to make him realize that she loved him not matter his or past relationship failures. » Submitted by nobodysbabynow   9:56am. 
That's exactly what I'm worried about. » I don't mean to sound Submitted by sanecatlady   12:09am. 
I don't mean to sound negative Nancy because I have heard of online dating working out. But around here... Most people (guys) use the online dating as hookups. My friend has done it for years with no success. My old roommate used POF for dates/sex. Another lady met a creepy guy who liked to be a baby. 
I'm not sure if the paid sites are better. Those were the only ones my friend used for awhile. 
I've always met guys at work, haha. Or at social settings with mutual friends. » I am starting to think it's Submitted by nobodysbabynow   9:57am. 
I am starting to think it's better to just get offline and join some real life singles groups. » I met my SO on POF. It can Submitted by Dad's horrible ...   12:34am. 
I met my SO on POF. It can work but you are right to be on the look out for red flags. I agree that if he'll lie about his age he'll lie about other stuff too. I don't get why anyone who is serious about looking for a long term relationship, would lie about anything! I mean, they're going to be caught out eventually! 
I had a game plan on POF. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. I used to be chatting to six or seven guys at a time. Getting to know them. Looking for signs. If they couldn't put in effort at this stage then they were never going to make the cut. This is a prospective life long partner you are looking for, not a lying, cheating scumbag. His messages should be full of honest detail about him and plenty of questions about you. No questions? No response as he obviously isn't that interested. Look for the clues. They are there. 
Good luck. POF worked for me. Just be careful. » I'm glad you got lucky and Submitted by nobodysbabynow   9:59am. 
I'm glad you got lucky and found a good one! I had several I was chatting with, and narrowed them down to six- then cut them all out for one reason or another, and all was left was this guy who I really liked. I was shocked to find this lie. » I look at online dating as a Submitted by BethAnne   1:54am. 
I look at online dating as a way to meet fun and interesting people, then once you have met them you can assess how you want things to proceed. In general when I was doing it I would meet someone I was interested in after only a couple of emails and get to know them in person. That way I could better judge chemistry and better read them in person. If there was no chemistry at least I had met someone interesting for a couple of hours. I don't think I ever met anyone who was an awful date this way and met some nice and interesting people. 
The only person that lied about his age (I think he might have taken off 10 years) I liked as a person but did start everything of with some lies/omissions and was sort of cheating on his on/off again baby mama. But I was able to figure this out pretty quickly and realized he was not a good match for me. 
I think that someone who lies about their age is either trying to play the game and get more or younger dates than otherwise would look at him or they are insecure. 
If your guy really interests you I suggest meeting up for a date with him and asking him in person why he lied about his age so you can fully gage his response. » Yes, I'm thinking that it's Submitted by nobodysbabynow   9:59am. 
Yes, I'm thinking that it's because he wants younger women, and that makes me think he's a player. » I'm 52, 53 next month and I Submitted by HeavenLike   5:24am. 
I'm 52, 53 next month and I am proud of it! I love this age, so it genuinely mystifies me what there is to hide about it. 
Guess it all gets down to motives. It's so easy to verify, just ask for a peek at the driver's license on the first date. 
But... if someone was going to lie to me about their age in order to get what they want from me, what else might they do in pursuit of that same goal? 
If you are looking for someone to ultimately be a life partner, you sure don't want it started based on a lie. » That's the thing- Like I Submitted by nobodysbabynow   10:01am. 
That's the thing- Like I said, I dated a man before who said he was 42 when he was 52. He wasn't planning to fall in love. So after falling in love, he confessed his real age. I had already known he was lying, due to his looks. Well, that relationship was full of broken promises, so I should know- I already know what to do here. Can't meet him. » I'm on the same page as Submitted by 2Tired4Drama   5:42am. 
I'm on the same page as BethAnne. My suggestion would be to temper your enthusiasm somewhat and wait to see how things develop. 
When you have a guy who seems to be interesting, don't drag it out with lots of back and forth e-mail banter. If the basics about him seem to be what you want, then arrange to meet them in a safe, public place. 
I also agree with Heaven, in that if you have already caught this guy in a lie (about a simple fact he shouldn't be ashamed of - like his age) then he's already got a strike against him. 
If you are throwing back those with red flags, this guy is already waving one. My guess is he lied about his age because he REALLY wants some woman in her 30's, who thinks he is 40. 
Next he'll tell you his daughter would LOVE for him to meet someone and his ex-wife is happy remarried and they get along fine. 
Edit to add: And that college age daughter may not be his only kid, if he's really 50ish. He could easily have a crop of older kids with drama/problems (including gskids) ... maybe he just mentions his ""college age"" daughter because she is the only one who looks good on ""paper."" » Yes, I've thought about the Submitted by nobodysbabynow   10:03am. 
Yes, I've thought about the same thing, too- the possibility of other kids. His ex gf is on his facebook. She's white, he's black, and she has mixed little kids. Are they his? He hasn't mentioned any other kids. » I online dated off and on Submitted by learningallthetime   5:41am. 
I online dated off and on from 2012 when I split with ex till I met my now SO and a lot of my friends online date also. It is a mine field. I think you just need to be aware that many people portray themselves as something else online. Also, different people have different agendas and are not honest about them. I was lucky and only had a few dates with different guys before I met my SO. But I was already fed up of it, and told my friends my date with SO was going to be my last and I would just be a crazy cat lady - nearly 2 years later and SO proposed a week ago on top the Empire State Building and we marry soon. 
Watching my friends, and from my own experience, women seem to have a habit of getting caught up in the texts and emails, possibly phone calls, before even meeting the guy. They enjoy the attention (which I think is the same for men) but women seem to build it up and make emotional ties just based on text, then get hurt. I agree with BethAnne that meeting someone quickly to assess real life chemistry is important. I had several dates where I met after a few weeks of near constant back and forth only to be disappointed. With SO we only exchanged 2 emails back and forth, then a few texts and met 3 days after the first connection. 
I have seen friends actually text and call these guys for months, be convinced it is the love of their life and then nothing. I think small fibs on a profile is one thing, but an explanation is needed. 
On another note, my ex trawls dating sites looking for vulnerable women, will say whatever they want to hear in the hopes of ""borrowing"" money. He plays the doting father on dating sites, when in fact is not. Dating sites are the ultimate fishing pond for the user. » Ditto for me! I exchanged Submitted by 2Tired4Drama   5:47am. 
Ditto for me! I exchanged about three e-mails with my SO before we BOTH agreed we wanted to go ahead and meet for a drink. 
Once we met in person, there was an obvious spark and we sat and talked for three hours at that first meeting. I had no red flag feelings about him (nor him me) and the rest is history. 
We've been together more than 10+ years now. » Submitted by nobodysbabynow   10:05am. 
Using women for money . This guy, I think, if he's not serious, would be probably dating more than one at the same time- cheating. » I think people get serious Submitted by moeilijk   6:55am. 
I think people get serious too fast. It's a date. That's the starting point, not a commitment. (I should probably say I hated dating because I was always looking for a serious relationship.) 
My MIL has done online dating off and on. She lies about her age. She's 67 and says she's 53. She doesn't want to start a relationship with an old fogie, she wants someone who can join her on her 3 day cycling trips, or who wants to go see live bands once a month. She doesn't want someone with health issues who won't be able to live her lifestyle. 
A boyfriend from long ago (back in the chatline days) told me he lied and added 5 years to his age because no one took him seriously if they thought he was 25. 
Maybe your beau is lying because he's a liar. Maybe he's trying to manage expectations. Bottom line, he's telling you he's available and he's interested in finding out more about you. 
Ask him about why he lied about his age on your date. If nothing else, that will start a conversation! ?

Photo: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty Images North Korea did not celebrate its founder’s birthday on Saturday by testing a new nuclear weapon, as many had feared it would. Instead the North Korean regime literally paraded its missiles through Pyongyang , including new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) systems that arms experts had never seen before. North Korea conducted a missile test on Sunday, but it failed , according to military officials in the U.S. and South Korea. It was likely a medium-range missile, which exploded almost immediately after launch.
Defense Secretary James Mattis responded to the launch on Saturday night (U.S. time), seemingly speaking for the president and White House.“The president and his military team are aware of North Korea’s most recent unsuccessful missile launch,” he said in a statement. “The president has no further comment.”
A White House official told the New York Times that while President Trump has many options available, he probably won’t respond to North Korea’s failed missile launch. “If it had been a nuclear test, then other actions would have been taken from the U.S.,” the official said.
Vice-President Mike Pence called the test a “provocation” when he arrived in South Korea on Sunday at the start of a four-nation Asia tour. Then, during a surprise visit to the Demilitarized Zone on Monday, Pence called the U.S. alliance with South Korea “ironclad,” and said North Korea “should not mistake the resolve of the United States of America to stand with our allies.”
“[T]he era of strategic patience is over,” Pence said. “President Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out and we want to see change. We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable.”
Related Stories The Problem With Trump’s Attempt to Scare North Korea Sunday’s missile test was North Korea’s fifth of the year. The reason it blew up is unknown, but such failures are a regular outcome for the regime. The Times reported that the U.S. began conducting a covert electronic war against North Korea’s missile program three years ago, though the extent of its success is not clear. President Obama apparently accelerated the program last year, and the Times notes that there has been a corresponding increase in the failure rate of North Korea’s tests since then.
The large collection of missile systems displayed during Saturday’s parade in Pyongyang still alarmed arms and nonproliferation experts. There were both new configurations of existing missile systems, as well as what appeared to be two new canister ICBM launching systems that may have held new ICBMs.
Whatever the canisters contained, the regime was clearly trying to demonstrate that, as it has repeatedly promised, it is developing long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles that are capable of hitting the U.S., as well as missiles that utilize solid-fuel technology, which would enable North Korea to more easily transport and hide its missiles and launch them with less warning to international monitors.

— NK NEWS (@nknewsorg) April 16, 2017 Ultimately, the regime is trying to convince the world that it possesses second-strike capability, or will soon — which means that it would be able to respond to any first strike on North Korea with a devastating counterattack on the U.S. or its allies in the region, possibly including a nuclear-weapon payload.
Some experts warn that appearances can be deceiving, especially when it comes to North Korea. For instance, it’s possible that the country was only displaying mock-ups of new ICBM systems on Saturday, rather than the functioning, or near-functioning, weapons themselves.
Regardless, analysts seem to agree that the world should be concerned about what Saturday’s parade said about North Korea’s gains and goals. Even if the regime was only displaying mock-ups, they show what North Korea intends to build, and that the government has made progress toward that aim. As one surprised nonproliferation analyst commented in response to the parade:
This is a lot of new stuff for a country with an economy 1/4 of Ethiopia to suddenly pull out of a hat.
— Kyle Mizokami (@KyleMizokami) April 15, 2017 Another expert, Duyeon Kim, explained to the Japan Times that North Korea’s missile pageant was meant to send “a message to its own citizens and the international community that the regime is ‘powerful,’ has made ‘leaps’ in technological advancements and will not cave under U.S. pressure.”
In an interview with NPR, Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, added:
I think in the United States we sort of laugh at [the North Korean regime]. We treat them like they’re a little bit of a joke, but they don’t think they’re a joke. And I think the North Koreans long ago concluded that their weapons programs are a way of getting us to take them seriously. And so I think a lot of times, we have expectations for the North Koreans, and the North Koreans like to defy those expectations. They like to show us that they’re serious about this, that they really can do this and that if there is a joke, it’s on us, not them. In Lewis’s opinion, the regime may have shown as many as three new ICBM systems on Saturday, and the overall demonstration was “bewildering” to him and other experts. While there have been many stumbles along the way, North Korea has continued to develop the weapons technology they see as integral to their survival.
On the other hand, the regime has never successfully tested a long-range ICBM that could reach the U.S. It’s unclear if the regime has been able to build a nuclear warhead small enough to mount on a missile or to survive reentry from space.
More ballistic missiles on display during the Day of the Sun parade. Photo: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images Aside from the new ICBM canisters, many of the rocket and missile systems on display during the parade on Saturday did not appear to be new; some were just variations of older models, or weapons that had been reconfigured or cosmetically altered. The regime unveiled two solid-fuel missiles, which have been tested but never before seen: a submarine-launched ballistic missile (with an intermediate range of 600 miles) that the country tested last year, and a similar land-based version that the North Koreans launched into the Sea of Japan in February. Most of North Korea’s missiles run on liquid fuel, which means they have to be fueled before firing, making the launches slower and missile systems easier to detect. Solid fuel missiles are preloaded and ready to fire, require a smaller fleet of support vehicles, and can be stored on submarines or easily hidden mobile launchers.
Amid the still-heightening tensions between North Korea and the U.S., The Diplomat ’s Ankit Panda sees the new missile systems, whether they are ready to use or not, as an ominous development :
[M]ore so than ever, North Korea seems to be highlighting the perils of a preemptive first strike to the United States and South Korea. With every nuclear and ballistic missile test, its threat of inflicting unacceptable retaliatory damage against Seoul and, eventually, Washington becomes more credible.

What’s more, we’re likely still in for a sixth nuclear test sooner or later. Even though Pyongyang withheld from testing this weekend amid rumors of possible retaliation by the United States, North Korea is still looking to improve its missile know-how. Moreover, the long-dreaded ICBM flight test also might not be too far off now. Given the ever-growing number of TELs — both wheeled and tracked — North Korea may soon field nuclear forces amply large that a conventional U.S.-South Korea first strike may find it impossible to fully disarm Pyongyang of a nuclear retaliatory capability. That would give the North Korean regime what it’s always sought with its nuclear and ballistic missile program: an absolute guarantee against coercive removal.

Time escaped from me last week and I never got around to writing this. That’s what happens when I decide to have an early night.
This week has involved quite a lot of uni stress, I must admit. But I saw a friend for lunch (and then saw her again at the end of the week), which was really lovely. Also, for me, kind of a big deal because to say I have a non-existent social life is an understatement.

Last year, for my brother’s 30 th , I bought us both tickets to walk over the O2. We finally did it this week, and oh my word, it was amazing! The climb itself was easier than I thought it would be but the view from the top was incredible. We were lucky with the weather; it was a really nice evening. It’s been something that I’ve wanted to do for a long time, so I’m glad to have finally had the chance.
As it is Easter, we had a family gathering today. There were thirty of us! With cousins and partners etc, it’s fair to say that I have quite a big family. It’s lovely how close we all are though. I even met my mum’s aunt and her son, and had a lovely chat about books with my Great-Aunt Joan! Just to keep things interesting!
It’s been a bit of a social week for me! Definitely need to get back to the studying next week – hopefully a few long days will help me to feel a little calmer.
I hope everyone else has had a lovely weekend. While you’re digesting some chocolate, have a read of some of the posts you might have missed this week:
Monday: Book Review: The Star of the Sea by Una McCormack Wednesday: Self-Care Friday: Film Review: The BFG I’m hoping to spend a little time on the blog over the next few weeks. Although I’ve been writing all the posts etc, I want to just give it a bit more of my time and attention and hopefully generate a real buzz about how I feel about it. At the moment, I feel as if it is falling a little flat, so would love to hear any suggestions about what you would like to see from me in the near future.
But for now, here is what is coming up next week:
Monday: Book Review: A Mighty Dawn by Theodore Brun Wednesday: Don’t Judge a Book By Its Cover Friday: Television Review: Orphan Black, Series 2 Saturday: Book Review: Dragon Trials by Ava Richardson I’ve been re-reading the Harry Potter books since January (slowly, on and off). I think my plan for the rest of the evening is just to curl up with Order of the Phoenix and lose myself for a while.
How’s everyone else’s weekends been? I hope you’ve been able to enjoy the long weekend and get some reading done! What are you all reading? Anything you would suggest? Let me know in the comments below!

We feature new songs from Eurovision artists or national final stars, or their much loved Eurovision or national final entries. This week, we’ve got the perfect mix of new and old, so let’s get into it! Listen to the playlist here: Let’s start off with new tunes from our favourite Eurovision stars, beginning with a new track from 2010 Eurovision winner Lena titled Lost in You. It’s the first song we’ve heard in a while from the German pop princess, and is set to be a single off her upcoming album. She definitely hasn’t lost it! From Ivi Adamou, we’ve got a recent single titled Afto Ton Kero which has traditional elements mixed with a bit of rock. From Swedish representative Sanna Nielsen, we’ve got the new Swedish language track, Inte Ok. We’ve also got a duet of Dami Im and Jack Jones titled Hold Me In Your Arms, a beautiful tune. From some Swedish superstars, we’ve got Benjamin Ingrosso , who is currently one of our favourites after his recent Melodifestivalen performance . This week we’ve featured Love You Again which was released last year. Also from last year, we’ve got Constellation Prize by 2017 Swedish representative Robin Bengtsson, and this was his Melfest bid for 2016. Also part of the Swedish national final last year (and this year) was Krista Siegfrids who we first saw at Eurovision in 2013 representing Finland, so she crossed the border to participate in Sweden last year with the song Faller, which we’ve included in this playlist. Lastly from Sweden, we’ve got one of our favourites from 2013 Eurovision participant Robin Stjernberg titled For the Better. Keeping with the theme of past Eurovision participants, we’ve got Emmelie de Forest, who also participated and won Eurovision 2013, and we’ve got Drunk Tonight, probably our favourite song from the former Danish winner, and we’ve featured the live acoustic version. Also from Denmark, we’ve got Anti Social Media, who we featured in our Top 5 Non-Qualifying entries from 2015 , except we’ve got their post Eurovision song titled Fire Exit. Also featured in our favourite non-qualifiers is Maria Olafs from Iceland, so we’ve got the Icelandic version of her Eurovision song Unbroken. Additionally, we’ve got Time by Uzari and Maimuna, which we thought would be a definite qualifier! Speaking of Time, we’ve also got this year’s entry called Time by the Ukrainian participants O.Torvald . Also from this year’s Eurovision we’ve got Keep the Faith , which we just recently reviewed as part of our 2017 Reviews . We’ve also got other tracks from 2017 artists, including Isaiah from Australia with his X Factor winners single It’s Gotta Be You. We’ve also got a collaboration between former Estonian participant Getter Jaani and one half this year’s Estonian act Koit Toome titled Rannamaja. We’ve also featured La chute est lente by Alma , and it’s left us wanting more from this year’s French artist! Last, but not least, we’ve got Gente Bestial, which was participating in the Portuguese national final , a new single from Sanremo’s Newcomers winner Lele titled Cosi Com’è, and the English version of Edurne’s 2015 Eurovision entry titled Break of Day. Plenty of new tunes to enjoy! Tell us which songs you enjoyed from our playlist, and which songs you would love to see in next week’s playlist!

ROSEMONT, IL. April 17, 2017 ? Rosemont, Ill.-based First Hospitality Group, Inc. announced today the grand re-opening of its SpringHill Suites Chicago O?Hare hotel following an extensive renovation. To celebrate, FHG hosted a grand re-opening event yesterday on Tuesday, April 11. First Hospitality Group, Inc. President and CEO Robert Habeeb made the announcement. 
The renovation, which spanned over several months, included updates to each of the hotel?s 245 guest rooms, including new décor, beds, mattresses and revamped guest bathrooms. 
?Our guests? experience is always top of mind when it comes to our hotels and service,? said Habeeb. ?As we want to ensure our guests are comfortable and feel at home when they stay at our hotels, we are confident that the new, modern and upgraded feel to each of our guest rooms and bathrooms, will provide guests with the best experience possible. We are thrilled to re-introduce this property to the Chicago area.? 
Located at 8101 W. Higgins Rd, the hotel is minutes from popular attractions, including the Donald E Stephens Convention center, Allstate Arena, Rosemont Theatre, Rivers Casino and the Fashion Outlets of Chicago. The hotel provides guests with a free shuttle to the Chicago O'Hare International Airport and to downtown Chicago attractions. The hotel also includes a fitness room, indoor heated pool and 8,500-square-feet of meeting space with an Outback Steakhouse located right on-site. Experience the newly renovated guest rooms for yourself by visiting http://www.marriott.com/hotels/hotel-photos/chico-springhill-suites-chicago-ohare/ 
First Hospitality Group, Inc. (FHG) was recognized as #1 in Travel in Forbes America?s Best Midsize Employers 2016. FHG received a #28 ranking out of the 250 best midsize employers in the country and #3 amongst all of America?s best travel companies. For more information about FHG, visit www.fhginc.com or follow them on Facebook at @FHGinc and Twitter at @FHGroup_Inc. Topic: In The May Online Hotel Business Review a primary issue as population growth, urbanization, pollution and wasteful consumption patterns place increasing demands on freshwater supply. Water recycling; installing low-flow fixtures; using digital sensors to control water usage; and even harvesting rainwater are just a few things that some hotels are doing to preserve this precious resource. Waste management is another major concern. Through policies of reduce, reuse and recycle, some hotels are implementing ?zero-waste? programs with the goal of substantially reducing their landfill waste which produces carbon dioxide and methane gases. Other hotels have established comprehensive training programs that reinforce the value of sustainability. There is employee engagement through posters and quizzes, and even contests are held to increase innovation, sensitivity and environmental awareness. Some hotels are also monitoring a guest?s energy usage and rewarding those who consumed less energy with gifts and incentives. The May issue of the Hotel Business Review will document how some hotels are integrating eco-friendly practices into their operations and how they and the environment are benefiting from them. © 1996-2017.

Photo: Ahn Young-joon, AP The Latest: Pence, on US carrier, pledges to defend Asia 1 / 13 ___ 9:30 a.m. Wednesday U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is on board an American aircraft carrier stationed in Japan amid heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula. A ship bell signaled his arrival Wednesday morning on the USS Ronald Reagan at the U.S. Yokosuka naval base south of Tokyo. The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier is undergoing scheduled maintenance at its home port. Pence told the ship's captain that he had spoken to President Donald Trump, and Trump ""wishes he were here."" The vice president is on a 10-day tour of Asia. He visited South Korea earlier and will head to Indonesia after his stop in Japan. The trip so far has been dominated by U.S. and allies' concerns about North Korea's nuclear and missile development efforts. ___ 7:15 p.m. A Japanese official says a difference in approach remains with the U.S. despite an agreement on a framework for new bilateral economic talks. The official said Tuesday that Japan still hopes to bring the U.S. back into a multilateral framework such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership . President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 12-country trade agreement after his inauguration in January. The official briefed reporters on customary condition of anonymity after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence met Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso in Tokyo to launch the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue. Pence said after the meeting that Trump believes it is in America's interest to negotiate economic deals on a bilateral basis. He said that the dialogue could lead to formal talks on a U.S.-Japan trade agreement, but that he would leave that decision to the future. ___ 6:50 p.m. After meeting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other top Japanese officials, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is ending his first day in Tokyo with a visit to an ancient Buddhist temple. Pence, his wife Karen and two daughters walked inside the main hall of colorful Senso-ji temple Tuesday as incense burned. It's Tokyo's oldest temple, and a highly popular tourist site that attracts crowds from around the world. Japan is the second stop on a four-country trip that is taking Pence to South Korea, Indonesia and Australia. It is his first trip to Asia as vice president. ___ 5:40 p.m. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence says the U.S. will not relent until it achieves its objective of ensuring the Korean Peninsula is free of nuclear weapons. Pence told reporters President Donald Trump was confident that economic and diplomatic pressure from the ""family of nations"" had a chance of compelling North Korea to cooperate. After talks with Japan's deputy prime minister, Taro Aso, Pence said the U.S. would work with Japan, China and other nations to get Pyongyang to give up its atomic weapons program. Asked what North Korea must do, he repeated that ""all options are on the table, and there they will remain."" ___ 4:40 p.m. Japan and the U.S. have outlined a path forward for economic talks between the countries. The announcement followed an inaugural meeting Tuesday of the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue in Tokyo chaired by visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso. It said the dialogue would focus on three areas: trade and investment rules and issues, cooperation in macroeconomic policy and specific industry sectors. The dialogue was set up by President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the Japanese leader's visit to the U.S. in February. ___ 3:40 p.m. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso are kicking off a new U.S.-Japan economic dialogue that was launched during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's meeting with President Donald Trump in the U.S. in February. As talks began Tuesday, Aso said the U.S.-Japan alliance has underpinned peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and that trade friction with the U.S. has given way to an ""age of cooperation."" Pence said Trump sees the talks as a way to improve business ties with Japan and is hoping for quick results. The discussions are to focus on economic and structural policy and trade and investment strategies aimed at strengthening both countries' economies. ___ 2:15 p.m. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese leaders have begun talks expected to focus largely on trade with America's anchor ally in the region, though tensions with North Korea loomed large. Pence reassured Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday that the U.S. considers its alliance with Japan to be a cornerstone of security in the region. Pence said, ""We appreciate the challenging times in which the people of Japan live with increasing provocations from across the Sea of Japan."" He also said, ""We are with you 100 percent,"" adding that the U.S. always seeks peace. Abe said Japan hoped for peaceful dialogue with Pyongyang, ""but at the same time, dialogue for the sake of dialogue is valueless and it is necessary for us to exercise pressure North Korea so that it comes forward and engages in this serious dialogue."" Pence was having lunch with Abe at the prime minister's official residence after arriving in Japan earlier in the day for the second stop of a 10-day Asia tour. ___ 12:15 p.m. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has arrived in Japan for the second stop of a 10-day Asia tour. His plane touched down Tuesday at the U.S. military's Atsugi base outside Tokyo. The focus of his trip is expected to shift in Japan to trade. North Korea's nuclear and missile development dominated the agenda on his first stop in South Korea. Pence told business leaders before leaving Seoul that the Trump administration is reviewing all trade agreements as part of its ""America First"" policy. White House officials say the meetings in Tokyo are meant to forge a framework for future discussions after the U.S. withdrew from a Pacific Rim trade pact.

Johnson, financial advisor; Clark G. Moffat, founder and CEO; and Marianne Martini, financial advisor. Shane Gibson photo 
Clark G. Moffat, founder and CEO of the Moffat Financial Group, has been helping people reach their goals for 35 years, including some clients that have been with him for more than three decades. 
“I have six people that I’ve work with 33 years – almost my entire career,” said Moffat. “I have many clients that I’ve had for 25 to 30 years.” 
Trust and results are the foundation of successful long-term relationships in the financial world and Moffat and his team provide both, giving clients peace of mind regarding their investments. 
“We hear from clients all the time that say, ‘I don’t worry about it,'” said Moffat. 
Moffat and his staff – financial advisors Jared S. Johnson and Marianne Martini and administrative assistant Lorie Frame – like their clients to be both comfortable and involved. 
“We like people that are willing to roll their sleeves up and take responsibility for their future, and we’ll help them achieve what their vision of their future is,” said Moffat, who has advised more than 1,500 clients during his long career in finance. 
The team at Moffat Financial uses a process called the “Foundation Process” to help clients identify their financial goals. 
“We lead with the planning process, and through that we help people identify both their goals, and also their values,” said Johnson. “When people are clear about their values, it helps them make smart decisions because they’re driven by the things that are most important to them.” 
“It’s all about aligning our clients’ goals and values so that we are doing the best by them,” said Martini of the Foundation Process. 
After a client’s goals and values have been identified, Moffat Financial tailors a long-term financial strategy specific to that client. The plan is constantly monitored and review meetings are held. 
“It (a review meeting) can be just one time a year depending on the complexity of the situation, to as many as three or four times a year depending on the complexity and the desire of the client,” said Moffat. 
“We’ll put all the numbers back in and we’ll go fully over everything and make sure our clients are still on track,” said Johnson of the review process. 
An independent and proactive firm, Moffat Financial has created a systematic process that is reassuring to clients and also helps them stay on course toward achieving the things most important to them. 
“Clients know there’s a process that we’re going to go through and it’s the same and that we do this every time,” said Moffat. “And as they begin reaching their goals, they begin seeing it. But the fact that is systematized, and that it is a very specific process we go through, it builds trust.” 
In another effort to maintain trust and keep clients comfortable, Moffat Financial works to make sure each individual is content with their investment strategy. 
“We just sent out a three-page questionnaire to our clients to reevaluate what their risk tolerance is, because what they stated or implied a year or two years ago isn’t necessarily the same thing to 
“And some of them have changed,” said Moffat. “Some of them have significantly changed their risk tolerance. We start with it (the questionnaire) – it’s part of the initial process – and then periodically send it out again because of age and stage of life changes.” 
The Moffat Financial team believes everyone – from teenagers to seniors – should be in tune with financial matters and thus spends time in the community. 
“We do a lot of educational events because we do want to make sure people – whether they’re our clients or members of our community – have a better understanding of their finances,” said Martini. “From teen financial issues all the way up to Social Security questions, we want to give back to our community by providing them with that education.” 
Moffat Financial has given presentations at both Bonsall and Fallbrook High Schools and has conducted seminars on Social Security at Fallbrook Library. 
“The more you get the information out there, the better,” said Moffat. “It’s about making smart choices. But you have to understand the choices before you can make a smart decision.” 
Seeing clients reap the rewards of smart decisions is something Moffat and his associates always enjoy. 
“It’s fun to watch clients achieve goals,” said Moffat. “It’s fun to watch clients do the things they want to do.”

We did not give you our lowest premium due, in part, to information contained in your credit history. Even so, your

credit history information that helps us to measure your insurance risk; this information does not necessarily reflect your
credit worthiness. We evaluate your credit history information differently than a lender would. Therefore, it is possible to

history:
• The average open date of all your reported loans and accounts was less than 6 years ago.
• Your most recent reported auto loan or lease was opened within the last year.
• You applied for credit at least once in the last 2 years, excluding auto or mortgage applications.

I hope that you all have a great day doing the things that you are free in this country to do.

I have been taking the weekend ""off"", so to speak, to spend time with my immediate family. I took my son fishing, I grilled out for the family meal, and we all watched a massive thunderstorm with spectacular lightning and loud thunder for about an hour and a half in the evening.

I decided to take a quick break from bicycles this weekend because I will have a lot going on in the next two weeks with Trans Iowa v13 coming up and with doing review work and more. This weekend was relatively free, so I grabbed the chance to take a break.

Sea Otter is this coming week/weekend and you will be getting a slew of news coming from all forms of the cycling universe soon. This event is pretty much the defacto introduction event on the cycling calendar in North America. Either just before or during Sea Otter the press release machines are busy with all manner of hot news. I saw where a well known editor opined about a month ago on Facebook about the fact that there were too many pressers to cover. That doesn't happen at Intebike anymore and hasn't for many years. It's all Sea Otter these days, so get ready.

After taking charge of his new office in September 2016, he took a tour of States with potentials for Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority, OGFZA.  
Unlike a typical politically wounded Nigerian officer seeker, he visited the man that was once his opponent in the contest of serving Akwa Ibom interest, Governor Udom Emmanuel and offered opportunity for Akwa Ibom to establish Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority. Mr. Umana did not stop at submitting the proposal, but set up structure within his agency to liaise with Akwa Ibom State Government’s committee to ensure the actualisation of this dream.  

Just last week, the managing director of OGFZA, Mr. Umana Okon Umana, said he was impressed at the pace and level of mobilisation and promotion by the state government to attract investors to the project and efforts to build and secure a licence for the proposed Liberty Oil and Gas Free Zone in Ikot Abasi. The commendation came after a careful review of work progress on the proposed free zone by Joint Implementation Committee at the end of a review meeting in Uyo by Mr. Umana Umana.  
A careful appraisal of events since Umana Umana mounted the podium of management at OGFZA, has galvanised many Akwa Ibom persons to ask if this is the same Umana Umana who was presented to Akwa Ibom people during the 2015 Governorship Election as pharaoh, wicked person who looted the state to a fault, is actually doing all these.  
The truth is now clear that Akwa Ibom people were persuaded to believe a different thing from who the man, Umana Umana is. That also means that Mr. Umana vision of becoming Akwa Ibom State Governor was not borne out of selfishness as put forth by his enemies, but a strong desire and commitment to bring development to the state. It also shows that with the wide range of contacts Mr. Umana has, if he were on the saddle of state leadership, the idea of industrialising the state would have been the easiest thing. 
Right from when he was a civil servant in the state civil service, both retired and current serving staff of budget office still testify of Mr. Umana’s commitment and passion for every assigned duty while in active service. Even when he launched into the political sphere of the state, he still demonstrated strong commitment in getting government work done on time. If Mr. Umana was not imbued with this sense of transparency and commitment to duty with interest of the masses at heart, I don’t think President Muhhamadu Buhari would have appointed him to lead a critical agency like OGFZA. 
With the coming on board of Liberty Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority orchestrated by Mr. Umana selfless interest to contribute to the development of the state, many Akwa Ibom youths will be employed and that will invariably halt incessant cases of youth restiveness in the state. As a humble man with good tact on human relations, this gentleman has created bond with Akwa Ibom millions of Akwa Ibom people. 
Without any gainsay, one of the strong traits of a good leader is capacity to let go. This is an important corollary to measure how mature a good leader or potential leader is. Mr. Umana has demonstrated this trait by letting go in totality the unwholesome experience he passed through on to a bigger challenge. He has compulsively worked his network. One of the most consistently common traits of a successful leader is the ability to relentlessly work his network because all success is built on a network of human connections that need to be nurtured and reinforced. Few days ago,MD/ CEO, OGFZA, Mr. Umana Umana, was invited to address 15th World Free Zones Convention in Doha, Qatar where he seized the opportunity to build more network that will attract investors to the state and Nigeris at large.  
The success story of Umana Umana cannot be ostracized from the prayer of his committed wife whose pieces of advice have contributed to the making of the MD/CEO of OGFZA. 
Today, Umana Umana is one of living legends Akwa Ibom State people will always remember. He has demonstrated that beyond politics somebody can still offer service to his people. Just like the Bible says “He that is faithful in little will be faithful in all”, it is the honest belief of Akwa Ibom people that since Mr. Umana Umana has been faithful in making good use of his office to better the state, he will be faithful to still serve Akwa Ibom people when a bigger opportunity comes his way.

Being able to find houses and apartments and compare prices more easily with online tools that even if you aren't using, your realtor might. Their kids being able to find new jobs or be recruited based on their skills for new jobs more easily with online applications and job searches, check reviews from past and current employees, and the like. These things being shown will help make the lack of coal and manufacturing jobs coming back seem less threatening, because it will make moving and getting a new job elsewhere seem easier and safer.
Show them new technologies that might be coming down the road that will make their lives better if only they participate in the new economy, rather than resisting it, methods to create more energy safer, cleaner, cheaper, and easier and more efficiently than coal ever could, internet based systems letting people have jobs over high-speed internet without the commute anywhere they want for many sorts of office type jobs, even living in rural areas if they want, so long as they vote to let the government expand high speed internet. Show them ways to improve farming, making it need less water, get that water that they need more easily, farm in more diverse climates, test their soil qualities to know what is best to plant or how to fix the soil problems they might have and improve crop yields.
Show them how new or believed to be upcoming medical technologies can help issues in their neighborhoods, like heroin addictions and overdoses of pain meds.
Show them how much better things are after environmental regulations, reminding them of things like smog choked areas making people sick. Show them how violent crime rates have gone down and intelligence tests gone up at the same rates as lead removal in various parts of the world a generation down the road from it. Show them how much more local businesses can grow by more easily expanding their customer bases overseas while not held back by retaliatory tariffs.
Show them the new tools that we have to let people with less intelligence do jobs that they could not do previously, like being able to ask google and wikipedia things, calculators that are more convenient and easier to use, smart-phone apps, specialized programs and more advanced tools created for certain jobs.
Show them how things no longer in mass production can be more easily ordered in the future or to a degree even now thanks to 3d printing, so they can fix old stuff they like that gets broken or needs simple maintenance with no longer created parts and tools.
Then, if they are still being stubborn, how them how most of the easy to get coal is already mined out, and how coal is now being beaten by gas and fracking (rather than renewables which they like to blame). Show them crops withering on the vine or robots being used rather than managing to get american citizens to do farm labor after scaring migrant labor away with threats of deportation and the like. Show them how American manufacturing output has actually gone up, and relatively few companies have gone overseas. Show them how shipping costs mean that you need to locate factories either near resource extraction, energy, or customers, and the resource extraction has been all extracted in many older areas, the energy isn't coal anymore, so also located elsewhere, and the customers are in cities, so new factories are being built in different locations than the old ones, so there is no reason for jobs to go back to their towns, and coal really is dead, so they, or their children, need to move where the jobs are going to now, and how that is something that has always happened, showing various ghost towns based on resource extraction when the resources involved dried up. Show them how many more people we can feed now with new farming methods compared to old ones, and how much we can expect to improve things if we adopt various already tested methods better and across more farms.
You need to be careful with how all this is presented, and make sure it gets to the target audiences by putting it in advertisements in the media they do consume, including local channels and even newspapers and stuff, or attaching it to their facebook and twitter feeds with targeted advertising methods or something, even if it goes against their normal politics, or actually get some of their normally partisan newscasters on board in sneaky ways not letting them realize the goals behind the videos you are producing might turn their people away from the Republicans or encourage rural Democrats to vote, possibly by couching things in the right terms showing off American stuff or warning about the threats of the new economy or showing off oil/fracking rather than hating on coal, etc. Things need to be shown in short segments in various aspects to the same audiences that illustrate the points involved clearly without directly threatening their biases and instead carefully shifting things within the context of their normal biases in ways they can recognize and not directly reject as lies. Lots of individual videos and adds and such, rather than single long ones they probably wouldn't watch or listen to or read in the first place, or would tune out of and not get the whole thing.",,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZShcLv2AiNvM_EISCDvjT.e47bw5ErTXQFRz6HopCHm6bpFNeFTpvkBE9U7FFtbVz0NRqGwpbwWEDrxEIRofeVoL7cGNZn2JJsiTvKFvj8Ek5.h.uLQoEgVnSKY_.sWptQ-,ad0f3d0523912b279e892a0bea77d8c63a876744,forums.spacebattles.com,https://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatars/m/287/287632.jpg?1391915339,https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/whitehall-the-sb-politics-forum.64/,Whitehall - The SB Politics Forum! | Spacebattles Forums,US,29444.0,0,spacebattles.com,11,How do you Beat Nostalgia in Politics? | Page 2 | Spacebattles Forums,0.011,discussions,15,[],[],[]

As I don’t do a lot of talking in the video, I thought I’d give you a quick written summary too! Here goes…
My birthday was on a Friday, but I decided to book the Thursday off work too and make a really long weekend of it. Elliott was at nursery so I headed to our local shopping centre. I was originally planning on having a massage first thing, followed by some retail therapy. However, my therapist had called in poorly, so my appointment had to be moved until later in the day.
I breakfasted in Costa and caught up on blog stuff. It might seem strange to blog on a relaxing day, but I enjoy being creative so it kind of is my way of chilling out.
I then headed to Primark before meeting up with my mom and heading around the shops. I didn’t buy much at all. In fact, apart from some underwear and a book that I will review in a blog post very soon, I actually can’t remember what I purchased. Mom and I had lunch in Five Guys. This was my first Five Guys experience and I have to say it was yummy. Particularly the strawberry milkshake! It’s probably a good job I didn’t know about them when I was pregnant, otherwise I would have always been in there!
We then did more mooching before I headed off for my spa appointment. The spa at my local shopping centre is gorgeous. I arrived early and sat on the comfy sofas and read my new book. When I was taken through to my treatment room it had been carefully prepared with low-lighting; soft, calm and relaxing music; buddhas and flowers. There was even a little sign which read ‘This room has been prepared for Samantha’. I had a 60-minute Swedish Massage and it was bliss. I thought I would fall asleep, but actually I lay there thinking. Again, this might not sound the most relaxing, but it’s not very often I get to zone out and just let my brain meander.
On my birthday itself we headed to the park for breakfast as I adore their pancakes. We didn’t really have a set agenda for the rest of the day, but quickly made the decision to head to Apley Farm Shop. This was a great plan. Enough of a drive to give Elliott a bit of a nap, a gorgeous on-site farm shop, classy soft play, a small farm area, a gorgeous flower and gift shop and a fabulous and very child friendly restaurant where we had lunch.
Elliott napped again as we headed home ready to open presents. As my birthday falls on St. Patricks Day I decided to put on some Irish music when we arrived at home and me and Elliott quite happily spent about half-an-hour jigging around to it. Unfortunately Elliott’s signature dance move was to spin round-and-round in circles until he got dizzy and fell over.
Gift time – with Elliott helping me to open my presents (you can take a look at what I got for my birthday here ) was soon followed by cake time. A delicious cake which combined my love of chocolate and my adoration of stars.
All in all a fabulous day :)",How I celebrated my birthday!,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTKSmliJaVAQTn.m7_W0oyrM_nQzwByDa8jHK5SF1w8UJYHZD9mIdjnhrgX7CIOoV7ttVHbszBWfMwAgWFC4U8MkR6sn41Gmmd9vA0rPlwSJw--,ad91eac0f93bff7a2710f4e3afc308af9b898601,wrinklewrinklelittlestar.wordpress.com,Not Available,https://wrinklewrinklelittlestar.wordpress.com,How I celebrated my birthday! – Wrinkle Wrinkle Little Star,US,,0,wordpress.com,1,How I celebrated my birthday!,0.0,blogs,0,"[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'elliott'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'samantha'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'costa'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'primark'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'apley farm shop'}]"
0,condo land,2017-04-16T08:41:42.000+03:00,[],,,english,0,2017-04-16T08:41:42.000+03:00,,"By: Stephanie Diana Wilson 
Site Condos have always been a tricky subject particularly regarding USDA and FHA loans. However, conventional guidelines have changed recently providing lenders more clarity on the difference between a Site Condo and a Detached Condo. And before it is asked yes this post is an extension to last week’s topic post on “It Is Not a Condo It’s a Townhouse”. Much like the confusion between Planned Unit Developments or PUDs and the various styles of condo units the style of detached condos which look a lot like a detached PUD within a sub division can look a lot like a Single-Family Home or SFR. 
Now before we start on this journey our normal CYOB moment. As a reminder guidelines change frequently and we are talking about guidelines posted online at the time of writing this article. If you have more in-depth questions be sure to contact your local mortgage loan officer or underwriting professional. Now that’s out of the way let us move on back to the topic at hand. 
The issue becomes when the title shows that your subject unit is in fact a condo in a condo project is it detached or not. Normally an appraisal will show pictures but; I must admit sometimes it is hard to tell in the pictures. So, my advice to underwriters is never be afraid to ask the appraiser to verify if your subject unit is 100% detached. Once it has been defined as both condo and if it is attached or detached the next big question to ask is if the unit is a detached unit in a project of detached units or is this a detached unit in a project that has both attached and detached units? 

Then we move on to trying to define if the unit is a site condo or a detached condo. Now Fannie Mae (FNMA) has made a list of defining factors that a site condo must meet. This info can be foud on the FNMA guidelines dated 3/28/17 at https://www.fanniemae.com/content/guide/sel032817.pdf on page 763 . 
Site Condo Definition A site condo is a detached condo unit in a condo project that meets all of the following: 
• Project consists of all single-family detached units where the unit owners own the land and the improvements on the land. 
• Project has minimal common elements, which may include project signage and limited undeveloped green space. 
• Project does not own any common amenities including, but not limited to, swimming pool, fitness or recreational facility, playground, laundry facility, or clubhouse. 
• Project does not own or have responsibility for maintaining its own infrastructure such as roads, street signage, electricity, water and sewage, snow removal, or garbage disposal. 
• Project has minimal or no involvement with a homeowners’ association, including no or little 
dues; no special assessments; and no road, amenity, or common element maintenance.
• Unit owners are required, per the condo legal documents, to carry their own individual hazard and other applicable insurance coverage, which may include flood and liability insurance. – (Fannie Mae seller guide dated 3/28/17) 
Now part of the reason that the defining the difference between a detached condo and a site condo is because they are underwritten differently. Detached condos that do not meet all the above noted items to be defined as a site condo are underwritten as a condo through limited review. Detached condos per the current guidelines do not limit the ability to do detached units based on Loan To Value ratios or LTV. Which we have discussed in other articles. So, regardless of the LTV detached condos are currently underwritten as a limited review. 
Now much like a PUD site condos do not require condo review process. Also, like a PUD a site condo is underwritten like an SFR. However, the current guidelines require that lenders must verify more info. Page 764 of the Fannie Mae guidelines updated 3/28/17 found online at https://www.fanniemae.com/content/guide/sel032817.pdf reads: 
For site condos that meet all the criteria listed above, a project review is not required. Instead, lenders must confirm the following requirements are met: 
• The project follows Fannie Mae’s requirements for priority of common expense assessments; 
• The project is following Fannie Mae’s requirements for projects located on land zoned as legal, non-conforming land use; and 
• The appraisal, completed using either Form 1004 or Form 1073, must confirm the local market treats units in such a project as comparable to owning a unit in a single-family detached housing development that has not been organized as a condo. 
Hopefully this info has helped you. Remember sharing is caring so share the article. Also, you can find me on twitter at @ sdgwwgds and on facebook just search condo land blog. If you have questions or topics you would like address send us a message or comment at facebook or twitter.

I happened to see it on Facebook and was delighted. Having her permission to republish it, I thought you might enjoy reading it. I was particularly amazed by the most accurate description of the “exotic scents” of India l I ever heard!
I am glad to be able to reconnect with her as well after 10 years!
Let her take you with her during her first few hours in India……
………………………………………………………………………………………………
Linda Smallwood..her account of her first contact with India…..
“Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! ‘Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor? ’”
(Romans 11:33-34)
I was worshiping prostrate on the roof — as was my habit every morning in India — when I noticed a spotted jumping spider moving toward me. I brushed it away with my hand, but it turned around and started toward me again. I reached out and brushed it away again, this time a little more firmly.
Then I noticed it was kicking and moving around in a circle, and I realized I had hurt it. “Ohhh!” I spoke to it. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you.” I knew I had to kill it. It was the “humane” thing to do.
Just as I killed it with my shoe, I felt a twinge of sadness. I shook my head. “A spider?! I’m sad about killing a spider?!” I rolled over on my back, stretched out my arm and pointed to God. “Are You kidding me?! That is not funny!”
My thoughts returned to a day three years earlier when I first arrived in India.
My host, Pastor Chaitanya, and his brother, Rao, had met me at the airport. As we stepped outside, my senses were immediately assaulted by a barrage of nauseating stimuli, the likes of which I had never experienced before nor even dared anticipate.
The calendar said it was November, and even though I knew I was going to a “tropical” area of the world, I honestly did not expect to encounter the suffocating heat and humidity that awaited me outside the air-conditioned terminal. I immediately staggered under the weight of it and had to stop to catch my breath. But, how do you “catch your breath” when the air you’re trying to breathe is polluted with reddish-golden sand and dust, and every molecule is filled with the stench of gasoline-and-diesel exhaust, human and animal urine and feces, mounds of rotting vermin-infested edible waste and animal carcasses, and sour vinegary body odors? As I gasped for air, I wondered for a few seconds if I would ever breathe normally again . . . . and I wondered if I really wanted to!
Later, I marveled at the sights of the city that boasted a population of more than 6½ million souls in only 250 square miles. I had never seen such an improbable and yet existent display of successful, albeit overwhelmingly challenging, cohabitation! Multi-storied concrete buildings towered above crumbling and abandoned shacks and lean-tos, leprous and crippled beggars huddled in small groups under bridges and in alleys, wild pigs and homeless dump dwellers vied for both space and for edible scraps among the many garbage sites throughout the city.
The too-narrow streets were congested with countless automobiles, dilapidated crowded city buses, overloaded lorries and camions, motorcycles, scooters, bicycles, auto- and bike-rickshaws, thousands of shoppers and meandering city dwellers, water buffalo and oxen taking their rest in the center of the streets, shepherds herding their goats amidst the motorized vehicles, wandering packs of malnourished street dogs, and prankish wild monkeys.
The sights and sounds of the city were as much an affront to my intellect and all human reason as the odors, horrendous stench, and heat were to my physical senses.
As we rode along, Chaitanya excitedly chatted about everything he had planned for me in the coming days. “Mom, I got you wahtel with yaysee!” he exclaimed with great glee and pride. “A what with what?” I asked.
“A wahtel with yaysee!” he answered. I had no idea what he was saying. As he tried to explain the meaning of the words, I finally understood that “wahtel” was “hotel”; but “yaysee” proved to be a little more challenging until he spotted a small sign that finally unlocked the mystery. The sign read: “A/C”. I said, “Ohhh. A C!” He said, “Yes! Yaysee! Yaysee!”
So, he had gotten me a hotel room with air conditioning. I really liked that idea! I could hardly wait to get to it, cool off, clean up, and rest.
A few minutes later, we were carrying my suitcases up a flight of crumbling steps in the train station, stepping past and over beggars and prostitutes, making our way down a dingy hallway toward my “hotel room” — and I was liking the idea less and less with every step. Finally, we arrived at a door with a huge 2-pound padlock on it. Chaitanya removed the lock, swung the door open to my hotel room, and motioned for me to go in.
I peered into the room and the scene shocked me so much that I honestly wondered if there might be a hidden camera somewhere and if someone was going to suddenly exclaim — and explain — “You’re on ‘Candid Camera’!”
Chaitanya took my hand and pulled me into the room. It’s not that I was fighting him, but I certainly wasn’t rushing in with great anticipation. The first thing I noticed was an old vanity dressing table with a badly pitted mirror. Next was the bed with a 2-inch straw mattress covered by a once-white sheet. The “air conditioner”, which was propped up in a hole in the wall, sputtered, spit, and spewed something that was supposed to be cool air but was about as effective as I would be spitting into a fan.
Chaitanya pointed out a floor fan that he thought would help. I was encouraged. When he turned it on, the head of the fan immediately dropped pointing straight down to the floor, and the bent fan blades noisily clanked against the frame. No matter what we did, we couldn’t get the head of the fan to stay up. Yippee!
I sat on the bed and thought, “What in the world have I gotten myself into?” I threw my head back and started to lie down when I saw them. Spiders! Hundreds of spiders! Every size and shape and mostly in the corners, not bothering anyone or anything and yet bothering me beyond words! Even though the ceiling was at least 10 feet high, I couldn’t help but bow down suddenly, as if that would prevent them from falling or jumping on me. Isn’t it funny, the things we do instinctively, whether they make sense or not?
Chaitanya called me into the bathroom and somehow I managed to stand up in that room of spiders and walk to the bathroom. I stepped up into a room with a marble sink, one tap sticking out of the wall, and a few hundred ants crawling around the edges. On the opposite wall was a toilet with no water in it, and Chaitanya showed me how to flush it with a bucket of water from a spigot on the wall next to it. As I looked around for a shower, my eyes finally rested on a gaping hole in the ceiling full of — you guessed it — more spiders!

As I crouched there, Chaitanya called to me from the other room, “Mom, we go now and come back in a couple hours to take you for dinner. Okay?”
“Uh-huh,” I half-muttered.
“Shall I lock the door?” he asked.
“Uh-huh.”
I heard the door shut and the padlock being locked on the outside of it before it dawned on me that I was actually locked in. I ran to the door and yelled for Chaitanya, but he couldn’t hear me because of the noise from the trains. I turned around and quickly surveyed my situation, thinking I could at least clean up and try to rest. After all, I’d been in there with the spiders for almost an hour now and not a single one had assaulted me yet, so maybe it would be okay. Plus, once I calmed down I realized that the “hundreds” of spiders I’d seen before really were only about 20 or 30. That’s still 20 or 30 more than I cared for, but certainly not hundreds.
I went back into the bathroom to clean up. Let’s see… Soap? Wash cloth? Towel? Nope. Nope. Nope. Toilet tissue? Nope. Heavy sigh…! [Note: Indians do not use toilet paper. They have an ancient system of using water exclusively. The other reason is is that they don’t have the septic system to handle all the paper, either. In many ways, India is still an ancient culture.]
Okay. Let’s review… An asthmatic air conditioner and broken fan. No soap, wash cloth or towel, no toilet tissue, no shower, no phone, and no way out. Now I was starting to panic.
I thought about my apartment back in Cleveland that I’d left just three days earlier. I thought about my nice clean carpeted and tiled floors . . . . and no spiders. I thought about my bathroom with hot and cold running water, a tub and shower, a working toilet . . . . and no spiders. I thought about my fully-stocked linen closet with towels and all the toiletries I needed . . . . and no spiders. I thought about my nice air conditioner and awesome fans . . . . and no spiders. I thought about my big comfy bed with an extra thick mattress . . . . and no spiders. And I thought about being able to walk out of my apartment and not be knocked over by heat and smells and sounds that defy all reason . . . . and, you guessed it. No spiders!
I slumped against the bathroom door frame and started crying. I had left Cleveland filled with joy and eager anticipation of all the Lord might have me do. Three days earlier there was no doubt in my mind and heart that He wanted me to come to India. Now . . . . I wasn’t so sure. I needed to be sure. I needed to know. But how?! Finally, I wept, “I’m sorry, Lord, but I don’t think I can do this. You didn’t prepare me for this!”
I felt His arm wrap around my shoulders and pull me close. His love flowed over me and so filled and overwhelmed me that my knees began to buckle. He spoke softly, “My child, I left behind a lot more than you did when I came here for you. And I didn’t have any of the things you’re complaining about…”
Ohh! I fell to my knees crying in repentance. “I’m so sorry, Lord! Ohh, yes, yes, yes! I will go where You lead, do what You ask me to do, be what You want me to be, say whatever You want me to say. Where You lead me, I will follow!” And I worshiped.
After several minutes, I stood up, dried my eyes, breathed in His sweet peace and love, and then added, “But . . . . You gotta do something about the spiders!”
Now . . . . here I was three-and-a-half years later, worshiping on the roof, and feeling badly because I had hurt a spider. “That’s not funny!” I shouted. “You were supposed to get rid of them . . . . not make me love them!”
He smiled.",“….And No Spiders!”,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6TeVyjG6o2moEtrUPOFKsaMQ2mWW2mcf5T0z2HZHh2bau3O2zaYES5E8vrWwNxLqcqeKXYxo12pfeIiQFV8Tc,b2ca4dbaf619616d87d75a6a54c80dd3fc0448a5,surprizedbythespirit.wordpress.com,Not Available,https://surprizedbythespirit.wordpress.com,“….And No Spiders!” – Surprized by the Spirit,US,,0,wordpress.com,1,“….And No Spiders!”,0.0,blogs,0,"[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'chaitanya'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'rao'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'pastor chaitanya'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'linda smallwood'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'cleveland'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'india'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'facebook'}]"

Iroh, a bearded dragon that first came to the Avondale Police Department last April as part of a pilot program, was officially sworn in Thursday by Chief Dale Nannenga and photos of the ceremony were posted to the department's official page on Facebook.
""Iroh got sworn in today by Chief Nannenga, Iroh is official!"" the post said.
The department said Iroh was originally brought in after officials reviewed research indicating reptiles have a strong enough sense of smell to make them more effective than dogs at detecting some types of narcotics.
""Research has shown that reptiles possess a strong sense of smell making their ability to detect certain illicit drugs possibly more accurate than K9s,"" the department said last year. Our pilot program drug sniffing bearded dragon will be assisting Officers in the City. Please help us welcome Iroh!
The department has periodically posted photos of Officer Iroh's escapades using the hashtag ""#IrohAdventures.""

San Bernardino Arrest Records San Bernardino Arrest Records March 28, 2014 | Author: Ben Kingsley | Posted in Business
Compared to the year 2011, the number of crimes in the United States increased by 1.2 percent during 2012, while the number of property crimes decreased by 0.8 percent. This is according to the Uniform Crime reporting statistics of 2012. In the State of California, the number of serious and property crimes inched up between 2011 and 2012, according to the new analysis of crime data released by the Attorney general?s office last July 2013. In San Bernardino, California, there are a total of 11,269 crimes recorded as of the year 2013. California, unlike any other states, is stricter when it comes to vital and court records. If you want to acquire a copy of San Bernardino arrest records Mike Glennon Bears Jersey , you can refer to the State?s Department of Justice or to the Local Superior Court.
The State?s law restricts access to such record only to the registrant and family members, genealogists representing the family. Records maintained by the Department of Justice are also restricted to legitimate enforcement purposes, authorized applicant agencies, and those individuals named on the record only. In fact, the state does not provide certified copies of vital records, particularly those that are utilized for identification purposes. However, anyone may request an unofficial, informational copy of San Bernardino public records through the County Clerk records. Third party requests for vital or court records will not be processed and accepted.
Should you wish to get a copy of your own arrest record for the purpose of reviewing the preciseness and completeness, you must fill out a Live Scan form and provide your fingerprint images. All California applicants should provide Live Scan fingerprints. The Live Scan form must also be filled out in its entirety, and you must include all your personal information. Once completed and printed, submit it to the Department of Justice along with the payment fee of $25.
In San Bernardino, vital records Hroniss Grasu Bears Jersey , court decrees including divorce, criminal, and arrest records can be accessed through the Local Superior Court. Official copies are restricted though. The State?s law restricts access to such records only to those aforementioned entities and purposes. If you are neither any of these, you can obtain an unofficial and informational copy. For arrest records, you may request access for such by going to the office of the Local Superior Court directly or by mail order. You can also appeal for an informational copy online in the comfort of your own home.
The Local Superior Court of San Bernardino operates and maintains the online portal for arrest or criminal records to assist the public in obtaining such records fast and in a convenient way. However, free public records provided online may be restricted to court records only, but these provide a way to conduct a local arrest or criminal record search over the computer.
Procuring public arrest records in California can be quite a hassle since the state has implemented many special rules in obtaining arrest and criminal records especially when conducting background checks. In this case, hiring an online service provider may help you get the records you need in a fast and more convenient way possible. Online service providers are available all throughout the web. Such providers can give you the records you need in just a matter of minutes for free to no fee at all. Just make sure to do a background check on the service provider you want to hire to ensure comprehensive and accurate results.

The objective of this study was to summarize the evidence regarding the effectiveness and dose-response characteristics of pre-operative exercise programmes on post-operative physical function following total knee arthroplasty, through a systematic review.
Twelve candidate studies were identified, but only 3 papers satisfied all inclusion criteria: 2 studies evaluated the effect of resistance training and 1 trial investigated proprioceptive training. The latter study elicited significantly enhanced post-operative gains in function for indices of standing balance (overall stability index: Hedges’ g = -1; anteroposterior stability index: Hedges’ g = -1.15; 6 weeks post-surgery). Results of meta-analysis based on the findings of 2 studies showed that, compared with controls, prehabilitative exercise involving resistance training offered no additional gains in isometric quadriceps muscle strength at 6 and 12 weeks post-operatively.
Despite a potential for efficacy of exercise-based conditioning, this review highlights the scarcity of robust dose-response evidence to guide the formulation of total knee arthroplasty prehabilitation effectively.

“I’m a bit of a frustrated artist,” Manolo Lopez tells me, his English accent touched with a surfer’s lilt. We’re on a walk through his new home of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, and he’s bringing me to one of his favorite spots, where the ocean meets a cemetery filled with bright-white headstones. Lopez chose the neighborhood so he could be inspired by the candy-colored colonial architecture that lines the hilly, cobblestone-paved streets. He’s here to run a business, to reconnect with family and old friends, but he also needs to sketch.
The admission shouldn’t be shocking to anyone who’s queued up for his Mofongo NY pop-up since its debut at the massive Brooklyn outdoor food market Smorgasburg in 2014. From the bright green pilón that illustrates its logo to the similarly saturated photos that populate its Instagram feed , it’s clear that whoever’s behind the brand has a deliberate artistic vision—one that aims to bring Puerto Rican cuisine to the kind of audience who’s seduced by a tight concept. Lopez, in running his business, has taken on the role of de facto cultural ambassador for Puerto Rico. He’s taken Mofongo NY to Japan, and he organizes a yearly New York City party with a group of other island-based creatives called Cosa Nuestra that he hopes to take global.
The concept worked in Brooklyn of course, where Lopez had moved in 2011 from western Puerto Rico, to work in marketing and design until growing restless and coming up with the idea of serving a twist on his grandmother’s mofongo —the traditional Puerto Rican dish of fried and mashed plantains topped with a protein, usually pork—to those strolling by.
This year, though, he’s brought his new-school take on mofongo back to his home island to sell—oddly enough—at a new open-air market much like Smorgasburg. The skills he honed in Brooklyn dealing with long lines and fast turn-arounds have come in handy, but here he doesn’t have to set up shop anew each weekend; the kiosks are stand-alone structures, making for a much more streamlined experience. A fresh concept for San Juan, it’s called Lote 23 and vendors are selling everything from cold brew tonics to bao buns to pizzas. Lopez’s food is the most traditional on the roster.
Serving mofongo to New Yorkers and tourists is one thing; for the most part, they didn’t grow up with the dish. Here in Puerto Rico, there’s no such luxury of ignorance. So he’s sweating the details and choosing to do his own take. His ropa vieja, braised for 12 hours, is gently added to the bowl with a pair of tweezers; pork loin is cooked sous vide. While it’s still traditional, this preparation shows off what he’s learned from years of eating in New York: to justify your existence, you have to offer a new twist.
The idea, Lopez says, is to introduce Puerto Ricans not just to mofongo, but to Mofongo NY, the brand, which he would like to expand into restaurants of various levels—from the street food at the base to a fine-dining take on the island’s cuisine—but that’s just what he’s thinking today. He “could never have a straight answer” for what he wants. “It’s constantly changing,” he tells me.
“I feel like I have more opportunity in Puerto Rico than I have in New York,” he adds. Though he’s only guaranteed to pop up at Lote 23 for two months and has one season left on his Smorgasburg contract, he sees himself staying on the island, near family who still live where he grew up, on the west side of the island in Aguada. He’s just become an uncle for the first time.
Lote 23 was founded by another young Puerto Rican who spent years in New York City working in marketing: Cristina Sumaza. While there, she had a part in founding the nonprofit ConPRmetidos , which was dedicated with connecting the diaspora to the island, but when she moved back she joined her family’s real estate development business. Sumaza and Lopez are part of a generation that is seeking to revive the island’s cultural life as a means of empowering it economically, in spite of, or in direct opposition of the ongoing debt crisis.
“When you compare Puerto Rico to the U.S., basically everywhere is a low-income community,” Sumaza says. “Coming from New York, I would go to tons of restaurants and markets. Here I was living in Santurce, where there are all these amazing chefs and artists,” and she wanted to create a space to support and highlight local talent. “They all have their own followers and fans,” she says, which helps create traffic for everyone. “The collective impact that they can all have is what makes this really special.”
Lote 23 has provided a launch pad for that potential impact, providing space mainly for concepts that are brand-new to the area. Established chefs, such as Xavier Pacheco, whose restaurant La Jaquita Baya is a few miles away in the Miramar area, here serves tacos he’s calling “bigotes.” Paxx Caraballo Moll, a chef who used to cook at El Departamento de La Comida and José Enrique, had trouble getting a food truck off the ground on the island, but regularly sells out at El Baoricua’s Lote kiosk.
“You wouldn’t go to Santurce five years ago,” Lopez tells me, but that’s changed. The Santurce Es Ley arts festival has brought tourists in who take pictures of the street-art-covered block Calle Cerra, and the nearby Libros AC bookstore offers music programming and readings. During the lunch hours, Lote 23 is populated mostly by office workers in suits from the nearby banks.
There are still worries that Lote 23 will be a gentrifying force; many locals initially took to the Facebook page find the food and concept to be excellent, but the prices high. One bowl of mofongo here goes for $10, and a Medalla (the ubiquitous local beer) costs $3. Lopez points out that you can get one in La Placita de Santurce , a popular hangout, for as low as $1, and in the more downtrodden Tras Talleres for even $.50. A focus on engaging community programming could at least help change the conversation, Lopez believes, and they are offering free weekly movie nights and yoga classes. Something seems to be working: As Lote has been open longer, some of the sticker shock has dissipated and five-star reviews have rolled in. “Excellent ambiance,” raves Luis A. Febles in Spanish on the page. “I went with my family and had a great time. We’ll definitely return!”
At the kiosk, Lopez is all business while he explains the menu to curious customers and roosters casually strut in from the parking lot. He and an employee are both decked out in logo-embroidered guayaberas and aprons made especially for this pop-up: “Born in Puerto Rico. Back in Puerto Rico.” The branding, as usual, is flawless.
“I learned how to fail over there and how to develop a product that was true to what I was doing, and it takes time to develop that—to the point now where I feel confident,” Lopez says of his time in New York City. But here, the mission has taken on new meaning. “We know how to brand things, we know how to make them look appealing, but can we make them taste good? Are we really being true to what our ancestors did?” Back home now, that has been revealed: This season will be Mofongo NY’s last in Smorgasburg, and the lease at Lote 23 was extended.

He finally joined in the fun Sunday night.
Bird busted out of his slump with a long home run that began a perfect night in the batter’s box, and Michael Pineda pitched New York past the staggering St. Louis Cardinals 9-3 for its seventh straight victory.
“That’s the Bird I know,” teammate Aaron Judge said. “That’s what he did in spring training.”
Aaron Hicks also hit a homer and Judge was robbed of one by a fan in the bleachers , forcing the young Yankees bopper to settle for an RBI triple. New York chased Adam Wainwright (0-3) in the fifth and finished a three-game sweep that left St. Louis at 3-9, the worst record in the National League and its poorest start since 1988.
“It’s an incredibly frustrating start to the season,” the 35-year-old Wainwright said after his first career outing against the Yankees. “I know Cardinal Nation is ready for me to get my act together, and I am, too.”

His cap cocked to the side, Pineda (2-1) permitted two runs over seven innings in a solid follow-up to his dominant outing last Monday. The right-hander retired his first 20 batters during New York’s home opener and struck out 11 over 7 2/3 innings for an 8-1 victory against Tampa Bay.
The strong encore Sunday was particularly encouraging to the Yankees, yearning for a steady season from a talented pitcher who has been maddeningly inconsistent throughout his tenure with the team.
“It’s important because you want him to keep going, and get some momentum,” manager Joe Girardi said . “He had a hard time doing that last year.”
Yadier Molina’s leadoff homer in the seventh trimmed it to 4-2, but Pineda maintained his poise and retired the next three batters.
“After the second inning, I got more energy,” he said. “I’m working so hard to be consistent every five days.”
Austin Romine and Ronald Torreyes, the bottom two batters in the order, each had a two-run double against reliever Miguel Socolovich during a five-run eighth that made it 9-2. The late outburst sealed New York’s sweep of an early interleague series between two of baseball’s most successful and storied franchises.
Chase Headley, who also reached safely every time up, singled to start the second, and Judge hit a drive to deep right-center, where a fan reached out just next to the auxiliary scoreboard hoping to catch a home run. The ball popped out of the man’s mitt and back into play, triggering a fan interference call by the umpires.
Following a replay review that lasted nearly three minutes, the ruling stood and Judge remained at third with an RBI triple — even though it appeared his shot would have easily cleared the fence if not for the eager fan.
“I think that was my first career triple,” Judge said. “So I don’t mind it.”
Bird made all that moot for the Yankees when he sent Wainwright’s next pitch way over the right-field wall and into the elevated bleachers for his first home run since Oct. 1, 2015, against Boston. The 24-year-old first baseman missed last season while recovering from shoulder surgery after hitting 11 homers in 46 games as a rookie in 2015.
Following an outstanding spring, Bird began the night 1 for 26 this season and hitless in his past 20 at-bats. But Girardi said before the game he saw some good signs Saturday and was committed to keeping the promising young slugger in the lineup.
“My timing was messed up,” said Bird, who went 3 for 3 with a double and a walk. “Tonight, I really just tried to simplify and swing at strikes.”
Hicks added a solo homer off Wainwright in the fifth.
A BRONX TALE 
Minus injured catcher Gary Sanchez, the Yankees have won their first six home games for the first time since opening 7-0 in the Bronx in 1998. The Cardinals are 0-6 at Yankee Stadium since Bob Gibson and Tim McCarver propelled them to a 10-inning victory in Game 5 of the 1964 World Series.
“We just got swept. I don’t have a whole lot of positive in my mind right now. Just trying to figure out all the things we can get better at,” St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said. “We just know there’s a whole different level of baseball we have.”
TRAINER’S ROOM 
Cardinals: 1B Matt Carpenter was hit in the bare hand by Hicks’ first-inning groundout and appeared to damage the nail on his right ring finger. A trainer worked on Carpenter, who initially had blood streaming all over his hand. He remained in the game.
Yankees: DH Matt Holliday (stiff lower back) sat out for the second consecutive day against his former team, denying him a chance to face good buddy Wainwright. Girardi said Holliday felt much better, however, and he would be surprised if the veteran slugger wasn’t available to play Monday.
UP NEXT 
Cardinals: RHP Lance Lynn (0-1, 5.23 ERA) faces Pittsburgh RHP Ivan Nova (1-1, 2.25) in the opener of a three-game series Monday night in St. Louis.

That year, he underwent surgery for a tumour on his lung. With the exception of a three-year stint as ITN’s political editor, he has worked for the BBC since 1986. He recently started a weekly podcast called Political Thinking .
One reason your doctor tested you for cancer was because you’d lost weight and got yourself a new slimline suit. Does it still fit?
It’s my favourite, but it only fits because secretly, after I had my cancer treatment, I had an inch let out of the waist. Normally, you’d be depressed as a middle-aged guy to have an inch let out on your suit. I have to say it felt like a doubly good moment.
Your vocal cords were damaged during surgery and you’ve undergone a lot of speech therapy. How is the voice now?
It’s almost there. Physically, it will never be quite the same as it was. There was damage to the laryngeal nerve that connects to your vocal cords. We’ve all only got two of them and if one doesn’t work, well, that’s a problem. Anyway, it’s working a lot better and it’s only noticeable to other people when I’ve got a bad cold or am very tired. I used to have to wake up and put my head under a towel with lots of steam and make funny noises, miaowing like a cat. Now I’m pretty much behaving like everyone else .
Having been through your cancer experience and witnessed the death of your good friend Steve Hewlett , how do you think the health system could improve cancer treatment?
I did a feature about that for the Today programme. The NHS has been much less successful at catching cancer early. Generally, the treatment people have after they realise they’ve got cancer has been good in this country, but we’re much too slow to catch it. The figures are really quite shocking. Thousands would live each year if we treated people with cancer as well as they do in Holland, Belgium, France or Germany. The key thing is to get people diagnosed much quicker.
We too rarely come across stuff that makes us reconsider, or at least flesh out our view
How has having cancer affected your outlook as a journalist and in life in general?
It made me realise how many people have their own experience of serious illness, either themselves or close family. People come up to you all the time and tell you: “I’ve got cancer” or: “My wife has”. It really underlined to me that there is a value in talking about it. Not for look-at-me reasons, but because people draw comfort from the fact that other people are having experiences like the ones they’re going through; it reduces one of the hardest thing about serious illness, which is the loneliness of it.
Do you ever get used to getting up at 3.30am (to work on Today )?
I think you can learn to live with it rather than get used to it. One doctor very helpfully said to me: “You do realise that more people die at that time than any other…” The time between three and four is a low for the body and that’s when lots of people take their last breath. I joke sometimes that I’ve never worked fewer hours, which is technically true, but I’m knackered a lot of the time because it gives you a kind of jetlag getting up at this time of the day.
Why did you want to return to radio?
The reason I wanted to be a journalist – there’s nobody from that background in my family – was because my best friend’s dad , Brian Redhead, was presenter of the Today programme. That’s where I got the bug. The first job I ever did as a journalist was on radio. The joy of radio is that it’s much less mannered and much less theatrical than telly. Don’t get me wrong, I love TV. For impact, it beats everything. But there is a sort of artificiality about television. I often think that people on TV – and I include myself in this – look as if we’re impersonating people appearing on television. With the job I’m doing now, it feels like you’re having a chat. That’s lovely.
You were in last week’s Spectator debating bias over Brexit at the BBC. Do you feel the BBC is an organisation that comes in for too much criticism?
You can never criticise too much an organisation that takes a lot of public money and has a privileged position. Everyone has to pay the license fee. We get a couple billion quid of public money, so we’ve got to take criticism, but equally we’ve got to stand up to it when it’s unfair and doesn’t have a proper basis. We’re in unchartered terrritory with Brexit, and most people, including me, didn’t see the results coming. So, boy, do we have to look at ourselves and ask ourselves tough questions about whether we’re interviewing the right people, asking the right questions.
Your podcast, Political Thinking, allows for some in-depth debate. Are you persuaded by what people say or are your views already established?
I think you’re always shaping them. We all come with our own prejudices to all subjects. The joy of doing a longer discussion is that you discover things you didn’t know. The danger with short conversations – social media has made everything boil down to 140 characters or a headline – is that we too rarely come across stuff that makes us reconsider or at least flesh out our view. One of the reasons I wanted to do these discussions was that politicians often complained to me that there was no real value in them thinking out loud because they just got pounced on by journalists like me.
Jeremy Paxman famously said of interviewing politicians that he wanted to find out why these bastards were lying to him. Do you think that aggressive style of questioning has had its day?
I’m a great Paxman fan, personally and professionally, but it’s one of the few things Jeremy said that I didn’t just disagree with but loathed. I don’t think that they’re sitting there lying and I don’t want to convey to the public that they’re lying. I’m quite unfashionable among journalists, maybe among people. In the classic conversation in the back of a cab, where people say they’re all liars and on the take, I’m afraid that cab drivers find themselves having their ears bent my me, saying that is not true, it’s lazy, it’s cheap and it’s just the way to guarantee that we have worse people doing these important jobs.
You studied PPE at Oxford. In a recent Guardian piece, Andy Beckett suggested PPE graduates run Britain. Do you agree?
If you’re not in the PPE club, people might think it is literally that: a funny handshake, knowing look and secret membership card. I don’t think it’s made a lot of difference to what I’ve done or achieved, save this: I think PPE is probably the degree for people who are great on their feet or, to put it another way, great bullshitters.
What are you reading?
Frank Gardner, the BBC security correspondent, has a thriller out [ Crisis ] which is a cracking read and has that insider’s feel. I’ve gone back to thrillers. I was a big thriller reader as a kid and then gave it up. Sometimes, when I’m trying to distract myself, my wife jokes that I need endless plot. So it’s a bit of endless plot I’m after.
You’re a Manchester United fan. What’s the verdict on José Mourinho?
He’s making United good to watch again, but it’s a pity about the results. For the past few seasons, I wasn’t sure if I was pleased to be going to Old Trafford or pleased to be not going. I now love going again because there’s excitement and buzz, particularly because of Zlatan [Ibrahimovi?] – but, boy, does he need to get someone else scoring and a few more wins.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence speaks to the media at the border village of Panmunjom which has separated the two Koreas since the Korean War, South Korea, Monday, April 17, 2017. AP Photo/Lee Jin-man 
PANMUNJOM, South Korea (AP) — Viewing his adversaries in the distance, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence traveled to the tense zone dividing North and South Korea and warned Pyongyang that after years of testing the U.S. and South Korea with its nuclear ambitions, ""the era of strategic patience is over."" 
Pence made an unannounced visit to the Demilitarized Zone at the start of his 10-day trip to Asia in a U.S. show of force that allowed the vice president to gaze at North Korean soldiers from afar and stare directly across a border marked by razor wire. As the brown bomber jacket-clad vice president was briefed near the military demarcation line, two North Korean soldiers watched from a short distance away, one taking multiple photographs of the American visitor. 
Pence told reporters near the DMZ that President Donald Trump was hopeful that China would use its ""extraordinary levers"" to pressure the North to abandon its weapons program, a day after the North's failed missile launch. But Pence expressed impatience with the unwillingness of the regime to move toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. 
Pointing to the quarter-century since the United States first confronted North Korea over its attempts to build nuclear weapons, the vice president said a period of patience had followed. 
""But the era of strategic patience is over,"" Pence declared. ""President Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out and we want to see change. We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable."" 
Later Monday, Pence said in a joint statement alongside South Korean Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn that the United States' commitment to its ally is ""iron-clad and immutable."" Pence reiterated that ""all options are on the table"" to deal with threat and said that any use of nuclear weapons by Pyongyang would be met with ""an overwhelming and effective response."" 
The vice president earlier visited a military installation near the DMZ, Camp Bonifas, for a briefing with military leaders. He also met with American troops stationed at the joint U.S.-South Korean military camp, which is just outside the 2.5-mile (4.02-kilometer)-wide DMZ. Under rainfall, Pence later stood a few meters from the military demarcation line outside Freedom House, gazing at the North Korean soldiers across the border. 
In Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking to a parliamentary session Monday, said: ""Needless to say, diplomatic effort is important to maintain peace. But dialogue for the sake of having dialogue is meaningless."" 
""We need to apply pressure on North Korea so they seriously respond to a dialogue"" with the international community, he said, urging China and Russia to play more constructive roles on the issue. deforested stretch of North Korea from a lookout post in the hillside. 
Pence's visit, full of Cold War symbolism, came amid increasing tensions and heated rhetoric on the Korean Peninsula. While the North did not conduct a nuclear test, the specter of a potential test and an escalated U.S. response has trailed Pence as he undertakes his Asian tour.

Trump wrote Sunday on Twitter that China was working with the United States on ""the North Korea problem."" His national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said the U.S. would rely on its allies as well as Chinese leadership to resolve the issues with North Korea. 
McMaster cited Trump's recent decision to order missile strikes in Syria after a chemical attack blamed on the Assad government, as a sign that the president ""is clearly comfortable making tough decisions."" But at the same time, McMaster said on ""This Week"" on ABC that ""it's time for us to undertake all actions we can, short of a military option, to try to resolve this peacefully."" 
Pence told reporters that the North Korean people and military ""should not mistake the resolve of the United States of America to stand with our allies,"" calling the alliance ""iron-clad."" He said the U.S. and its allies would deal with the situation ""through peaceable means or ultimately by whatever means are necessary."" 
After a two-month policy review, the Trump administration settled on a policy dubbed ""maximum pressure and engagement,"" U.S. officials said Friday. The administration's immediate emphasis, they said, was to be on increasing pressure on Pyongyang with the help of Beijing. 
The officials weren't authorized to speak publicly on the results of the policy review and requested anonymity. 
Pence sought to explain the policy in meetings with South Korea Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn and other top officials in Seoul at the start of the trip, which will also include stops in Japan, Indonesia and Australia. He will aim to reassure allies in South Korea and Japan that the U.S. will take appropriate steps to defend them against North Korean aggression. 
The concerns were exacerbated after a North Korean missile exploded during launch on Sunday, U.S. and South Korean officials said. The high-profile failure came as the North tried to showcase its nuclear and missile capabilities around the birth anniversary of the North's late founder and as a U.S. aircraft carrier neared the Korean Peninsula. 
The Trump administration is hoping that China will help rein in North Korea in exchange for other considerations. Last week, Trump said he would not declare China a currency manipulator, pulling back from a campaign promise, as he looked for help from Beijing, which is the North's dominant trade partner. 
""Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem? We will see what happens!"" Trump tweeted on Sunday. 
Along with the deployment of the U.S. aircraft carrier and other vessels into waters off the Korean Peninsula, thousands of U.S. and South Korean troops, tanks and other weaponry were deployed last month in their biggest joint military exercises. That led North Korea to issue routine threats of attacks on its rivals if they show signs of aggression. 
The White House foreign policy adviser traveling with Pence told reporters that the type of missile that North Korea tried to fire on Sunday was medium-range, and that it exploded about 4 to 5 seconds after it was launched. 
The North regularly launches short-range missiles, but is also developing mid-range and long-range missiles meant to target U.S. troops in Asia and, eventually, the U.S. mainland. 
North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests, including two last year. Recent satellite imagery suggests the country could conduct another underground nuclear test at any time.

WASHINGTON — How often do students miss school? Are they ready for college? Are they physically fit? Is their school a welcoming place? 
States are beginning to outline new ways to evaluate their schools, rather than relying just on traditional measures such as test scores. 
The plans are required under a new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, which takes effect in the coming school year. 
Under the new law, states are focusing more on academic growth, meaning not just whether students have achieved a certain academic level in reading and math, but whether they have improved over time. 
Mike Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, said that's a big change from the No Child Left Behind Act, the previous version of the education law. ""Schools and educators should feel good about that; that will be a fairer way to measure school quality,"" he said. 
But while most experts praised the flexibility and innovation offered by the new law, some think that in the absence of federal guidelines some states may overlook groups of students who need additional support, such as minorities, students with disabilities and English-language learners. The Republican-controlled Congress moved swiftly this year to rescind key federal accountability guidelines passed by the Obama administration to help states implement the new law. 
So far, nine states and the District of Columbia have submitted their accountability plans to the Education Department for review, and seven states are completing their blueprints. The remaining states will submit their plans in September. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will decide whether to accept or reject them. She has said her goal is state and local flexibility in education and indicated that she might use the process to advance school choice. 
When evaluating school quality, states are experimenting with new indicators. Almost all of the first-round states have adopted chronic absenteeism, or how many students miss more than 10 per cent of the school year, as a key metric. 
Connecticut and Delaware, among others, also will be tracking college readiness, or whether high school students are taking advanced classes and how successful they are on college admission tests like the SAT. 
Tennessee wants to give every public school in the state a grade from A to F, which state Education Commissioner Candice McQueen says would give parents better information about schools. The grade will take into account such things as how well English language learners are doing and whether disabled students are being served. The schools will also be graded on chronic absenteeism rates, and if students are ready for college or the military and whether traditionally underserved students are performing well. Graduation rates also will count. 
Nevada outlined a system that focuses on student growth measures, including test scores, English language proficiency, and graduation rates. Massachusetts will be paying attention to academic results in ninth grade. 
In New Mexico, the state will begin tracking the need for additional tutoring in college and linking those back to high schools where the students studied. The state also will look at how students do in science in ranking schools. 
Some states are getting creative. Vermont and Connecticut want to make physical fitness another sign of school quality, while Connecticut also believes access to arts education should be another measure. Illinois wants to conduct ""climate surveys"" asking whether children feel they are in a safe and welcoming environment. 
""There is a lot more than just tests that matter for student success,"" said Natasha Ushomirsky with the Education Trust. ""Tests are important and looking at progress is important, but states are getting a better picture of how schools are serving students."" 
Another common thread that has emerged from the first round: States are doing a better job of involving parents, teachers and community activists in the process. ""They've been very proactive to engage anybody who has an interest in the plans,"" said Kirsten Carr with the Council of Chief State School Officers. 
But Marc Magee, CEO of 50Can, an education non-profit , expressed concern that ""if everybody doesn't hold up their end of the bargain, we could go back to that era where certain populations of students become invisible inside schools even if they are struggling mightily and not getting the opportunity that they deserve."" 
And Lindsey Tepe, senior education policy analyst at New America, said there is so much variation in how states want to evaluate their schools that national comparisons could be difficult. ""Without the guidance, there isn't really a recipe to follow,"" said Tepe.

Two undercover FBI agents can hide who they are from everyone but each other in the latest novel from the New York Times bestselling author of Suddenly One Summer . FBI agents Jessica Harlow and John Shepherd have a past. The former lawyer and cocky Army ranger clashed during their training at Quantico, gladly going their separate ways after graduating from the Academy. Six years later, the last thing either of them expects is to run into each other again–assigned to work as partners in a high-profile undercover sting. For both of them, being paired with a former rival couldn’t come at a worse time. Recently divorced from a Hollywood producer and looking for a fresh start, Jessica is eager to prove herself at her new field office. And John is just one case away from his dream assignment to the FBI’s elite Hostage Rescue Team. In order to nail a corrupt Florida politician, they’ll have to find a way to work as a team–a task that becomes even trickier when they’re forced to hole up at a romantic, beachfront resort as part of the investigation. Suddenly, the heat behind their nonstop sparring threatens to make the job a whole lot more complicated. . . 
Cocktails and Books received this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect our opinion of the book or the content of our review. 
I thoroughly enjoyed this fun and flirty story. What makes it so captivating are the well-developed characters and the witty, snappy dialogue. I enjoyed the main characters and all the entertaining secondary characters. This is a fast paced story with a hunky, alpha male hero and a sassy heroine. 
Special agent John Shepperd and special agent Jessica Harlow first meet when they go through the FBI academy in Quantico together. They spend twenty-one weeks trying to outwit each other and compete over everything. By the end of their training, they loathe each other and hope they never meet again. Before joining the FBI, John was an Army Ranger and is the biggest, most athletic in their training group. While Jessica, an attorney, is one of two women in their class and feels she has to constantly prove herself. 
Now, six years later, Jessica moves back to her hometown of Chicago and finds herself partnered with her former nemesis, John. Neither of them is happy to be working undercover together and find themselves falling right back into their old habit of competing over everything. I was laughing out loud, enjoying their snarky remarks and how they continually try to one-up each other. All the while, pretending to everyone else, they get along. As they work on the case, they grudgingly start to admire each other and find themselves having to fight their mutual attraction. 
I loved the chemistry between John and Jessica. They have a dry wit and there is a lot of verbal bantering and funny lines. Julie James has an easy, breezy, carefree style of writing that is so hard for most writers to achieve but she seems to do it effortlessly. I was immediately transported into John and Jessica’s world and I never wanted to leave.",Review: The Thing About Love by Julie James,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.qTK8pmX2kDVRpyMSM5FbBXU1rZerkumcgR7SSQQHPWudQ3wgpqpqcFbftwA2AE_ovgiDwvr8YWx.DPTo_PWCpT9TRVb_sUAM-,be66bf7afca0d4f34278f2c0b0b1a977ae45ce8d,www.cocktailsandbooks.com,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1467222882l/27246123.jpg,http://www.cocktailsandbooks.com/feed,Cocktails and Books,US,,0,cocktailsandbooks.com,1,Review: The Thing About Love by Julie James,0.0,blogs,0,"[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'julie james goodreads'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'john shepperd'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'julie james'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'john'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'john shepherd'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'jessica'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'jessica harlow'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'quantico'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'hollywood'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'chicago'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'florida'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'fbi'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'hostage rescue team'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'new york times'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'army ranger'}]"

And at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February, chief strategist Steve Bannon said that the goal of the administration was the “deconstruction of the administrative state.”
Trump has delivered on those pledges, signing over a dozen laws reversing Obama-era regulations, marking the most substantial legislative achievement of his first 100 days in office.
Politico has downplayed Trump’s slew of repeal laws, describing them as “the only substantive bills Trump has signed so far.” And, in keeping with a media-wide effort to separate Trump from his voting base, Politico claims that “none of them evoke the drain-the-swamp anti-establishment populism that Trump rode to the presidency.”
The opposite is true, on both counts: Trump has permanently removed some of the regulatory muck that the “swamp” uses to feed itself.
His weapon has been the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which Politico calls “obscure.” It was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, when he was campaigning for re-election and determined to prove he had learned the lessons of the 1994 midterm elections — that “the era of big government is over.” The CRA allows Congress to overturn rules by a federal agency 60 days after they are reported to Congress. It was aimed at rules made by “lame duck” presidents.
But as the Wall Street Journal‘s Kimberly Strassel noted in January, two factors make the CRA particularly powerful. One is inherent to the legislation itself, which provides that a regulation, once repealed, cannot be promulgated again without a new act of Congress.
The other factor is the arrogance and incompetence of the Obama administration, which failed to report many rules to Congress — meaning the 60-day window never began even for some earlier Obama rules.
Here is the list of Obama-era regulations that President Trump has managed to repeal using the CRA so far:
Overzealous transparency: H.J. Res. 41 reversed a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that was crafted as an anti-corruption measure under the Dodd-Frank regulations but energy companies considered too onerous. Critics complained that the regulation gave foreign energy companies a pass while hurting domestic companies.
Coal mining: H.J. Res. 38 ended the “Stream Protection Rule,” a Department of the Interior rule that hurt coal.
Gun control: H.J. Res. 40 reversed a rule by the Social Security Administration, which had yet to take effect, restricting gun purchases by the mentally ill through the use of additional firearms background checks.
Labor “blacklisting”: H.J. Res 37 ended a “blacklisting” rule, under several agencies, that required federal contractors to disclose any violations of 14 other labor regulations within the previous three years.
Land use: H. J. Res 44 ended a Department of the Interior rule, “Bureau of Land Management Planning 2.0,” that gave the federal government more, and state and local government less, authority in land use decisions.
Federal education standards: H. J. Res 57 and H.J. Res 58 reversed new federal standards for new teachers that the Department of Education had sought to impose under legislation signed by President Obama in 2015.
Drug testing for unemployment: H.J. Res. 42 overturned a Department of Labor regulation that had restricted the use of drug testing to determine workers’ eligibility to receive unemployment compensation.
Hunting predators: H.J. Res. 69 reversed a Department of the Interior rule, pushed by animal rights activists, banning non-subsistence hunting of predator species for population control in wildlife refuges in Alaska.
Injury paperwork: H. J. Res. 83 nullified a Department of Labor rule requiring more records of worker injuries.
Broadband privacy: S. J. Res 34 repeals an FCC rule requiring Internet Service Providers to ask customers before sharing private information with advertisers — which Google and Facebook could still do under the rule.
Forced savings: H. J. Res. 67 reverses a Department of Labor rule allowing states to force workers to save.
Planned Parenthood: H. J. Res 43 repeals a mandate that all but required states to fund the abortion provider.
The window for repealing rules from the last several months of Obama’s presidency closes in May — though some argue that President Trump may have the power to repeal regulations dating back to the start of Obama’s first term.
Regardless, the use of the CRA to repeal regulations has put future administrations on notice that there is a limit to government’s regulatory reach, and that given the opportunity by the voters, conservatives will enforce those limits.
It is true that the Trump administration has not yet signed a major, signature piece of legislation. Neither had Obama in the first 100 days — unless one counts the stimulus, which wasted nearly a trillion dollars and inspired the Tea Party. The “failure” of the American Health Care Act, which intended to repeal and replace Obamacare, may be temporary, as Republicans are determined to revisit the issue and propose new legislation that can be signed by the 2018 midterms.
Even without the CRA, the Trump administration can claim it scored two other major achievements in the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and the renewal of America’s military deterrent after the recent attack on Syria.
But the use of the CRA is no small accomplishment. Future administrations will never be as careless in expanding the executive authority of the federal government far beyond the scope of the authority envisioned in the U.S. Constitution.

I hope you ate more Easter eggs than I did, even one would be more than I had this weekend. Speaking of Easter, bunnies are the cutest animals ever, however many brands still test on bunnies. I am quite ashamed to admit that not everything I own is cruelty free but I do try to keep my purchases bunny friendly unless there is no cruelty free similar product. These are two sites you can check for cruelty free products: http://www.leapingbunny.org / and   http://www.bwcsa.co.za/ . I will of course do a more extensive post about this soon.
Lipsticks are my favourite beauty product, there is something about putting on lipstick even without any other make up that just brightens up your face. I am still obsessed with liquid lipsticks particularly those that dry matte but I will say while there are many formulas out there, this is only one thus far, that I place on a high pedestal for the simple reason that it does not dry down my lips or flake.
The Huda Beauty liquid mattes by far outshine every other liquid lipstick that I have tried. Not only is Huda Kattan an extremely successful make up artist, beauty blogging extraordinaire, influencer and Youtube sensation but she also has her own make up line.

HUDA BEAUTY LIQUID MATTE LIPSTICK REVIEW 
Product description(website shophudabeauty.com): 
Introducing Huda Beauty’s latest lip lo lobeautifier: the Liquid Matte, an unrivaled take on the liquid lipstick. The tried and true comfort-wear formula is infused with an exclusive complex to help maintain the lips’ hydration. The lightweight formula glides on a thin coat of color that intensifies as it sets to a matte, transfer-free finish with amazing staying power. You might even forget you’re wearing anything on your lips at all! Pair it with a complementary Huda Beauty Lip Contour to set off your look.
What it is formulated WITHOUT:
– Parabens
– Phthalates
What else you need to know:
“I created these because I could never find a liquid lipstick that suited my needs. This formula is so light, it feels like you’re wearing nothing at all, but gives you a long-lasting, transfer-free finish in shades to die for.”—Huda Kattan
This product is cruelty-free and free of gluten. Please note: the color’s appearance may vary based on skintone once set.
Ingredients: 

Packaging:  
Each liquid lipstick comes beautifully packaged in a cardboard sliding out carton with transparent plastic outer covering. The biting lips is on the box with the lipstick in between allows you to see the colour from the carton. The lip gloss like tube is square shaped and has a matte look. It is the most stunning liquid lipstick I have owned. It has a doe-foot applicator like most liquid lipsticks. I particularly like the wand applicator which is long enough to give you control of the application. Most people would discard the box for better storage but its way too pretty for me to throw away.

Price: 
20$ in countries that it retails. R550- R650 in South Africa from importers.
Color:  
The two shades I own are Famous which is a dark vampy red and Heartbreaker, a pinky bright red. Famous is my ‘famous’ lip colour, it is my all time favourite but both shades would suit all skin tones. It does dry down a shade or two darker post application. The range is quite extensive with nudes, pinks, reds and browns, there is a shade for everyone. She also recently released 3 new nudes.

Formula: 
Firstly the smell of this lipstick is like vanilla cake batter, I love the smell so much. The formula itself is very thin and lightweight but not runny like Colourpop Ultra Matte for instance. It takes about a minute to dry down which makes it perfect for ombre lip looks.  The best part about these lipsticks is it does not cling to dry patches, it looks even whether I have dry lips or not. It does transfer a bit however when you apply a second layer your lips will not look or feel cakey. It is comfortable on the lips and there is no stickiness to it.
Pigmentation: 
It is very pigmented and one stroke on the lips could cover well. Two strokes will give you a full even coverage. It glides on effortlessly and does not look streaky or patchy. Neither does it sink into the fine lines on the lips. If you use a thin layer there is less chance of transference but you still get that “wow” pigmentation.
With flash No flash, under light Staying power: 
I applied this lipstick before 1pm and it was still on after 8pm and I was drinking in between. I find this last pretty well on my lips, estimated about 6-8 hours. If you are eating you may need to reapply but when it does fade it does so evenly, it does not crumble or flake off. No liquid lipstick would last you through an entire make out session and I am not sure why people expect it too. It doesn’t last less than 4-5 hours. Ofcourse, using a lipscrub and lip balm would help it last longer, you can read what I use  here .
Overall experience and thoughts: 
I truly love these liquid lipsticks because they are so pigmented and work effortlessly. I don’t usually need to reapply but if I do then they are easy to build upon. It is the most hydrating and wearable formula I have used. The only other formula I have used that compares is the Limecrime but that was slightly drying and more tacky. I understand it is pricey and not that easy to get ahold of. So is it worth it? I give this a 9.5/10, I think it it could last slightly longer. I would recommend it if you can afford it. If not the closest dupe a friend Nerissa Naidoo suggested is The Balm matte liquid sticks you can purchase from Stuttafords. I personally recommend Rimmel provocalips or Colourpop Ultra mattes it you are looking for a drugstore or budget friendly alternative.
You can purchase Huda beauty liquid mattes lipsticks from http://www.musebeauty.co.za , http://www.samika.co.za and VanityLine on Facebook .
Here are some swatches on my lips:

The games provided on to play with Real Money are Texas
Maintain’em, Omaha, Seven Stud and these are video games which undoubtedly require skill and intelligence.
Now because the Supreme Court has refused to determine concerning the legality or illegality of operating websites of on-line poker, online rummy, on-line
card video games, and many others, it is imperative that they comply with numerous techno authorized legal guidelines
of India on this regard. But, because of a superb poker face, some very observant studying of
Riess’s play, some daring strikes and most importantly,
a properly-timed and consistent bluff, Farber gained, and the way!
The checklist we’ve prepared represents the best online poker in India on the Web by
reviewing and rating dozens of such sites. When playing poker for actual money from India, essentially the most typically asked query is.
What is the easiest way to deposit?” We provide an in depth deposit information for Indian gamers , but I’ll provide a summary. BG Poker Room is a Kolkata based mostly gaming company where technique skilled primarily based games are played. There’s a surge of Indian gamers logging on to the web with actual cash purchase-ins for money video games and tournaments.
The world’s first web site to offer the entire array of Poker Game options corresponding to Ring Sport, Sit n Go, Multi Table Tournaments, Foyer Filters and so on on the cellular, Leisureplay is proud of the know-how milestones it has achieved in a short span of time and is consistently being acknowledged by business veterans for the quality of its products. On-line poker is passing by the use of an consideration-grabbing part in Unites States (U.S.). Nonetheless, it is nonetheless to be seen whether or not on-line poker might be banned or allowed in U.S. New Jersey has reported an excellent starting for online enjoying inside the state.
Comparable occasions are being put together by the India Novice Poker League (IPRT) and the India Poker Championship (IPC). Remember however that cheques aren’t issued in Indian Rupees and gamers may run into difficulties when attempting to lodge them in an area Indian financial institution. Ask any Mumbaikar between the ages of 25 and forty if he performs poker in India and you’ll be on the receiving finish of a proud smile. The site is especially tailor-made for Indian poker enthusiasts where players can play on Freeroll as well as Real Cash Tables.
Among different things, visitors will discover a each day dose of articles with the latest poker information, reside reporting from tournaments, unique videos, podcasts and a lot more. Most poker rooms in India are still small, containing eight tables on the most. Riyaaz Amlani is named the King of the Cafe’s & we had the chance to ask the entrepreneurial mogul in regards to the sport of poker and his views on the sport! Players who qualify to the 12 groups will then play in the Mega Finals, the place one of the best of India’s poker talent will probably be invited to a display of talent and entertainment Burman said that in the first yr, the ultimate will probably be aired on Facebook and Youtube only.
If you’re on the lookout for a real quality poker chips, you could go for it. No different product present at such a low cost. One of the latest started poker rooms in Bangalore, Rockets Poker has gained reputation in 2014 because of a number of assured prize tournaments and attractive interiors as well. Few video games answer this query extra convincingly than poker, a family of card video games in which gamers guess money on the premise of the mixture of the playing cards accessible to them. BE AWARE: believes in responsible gaming for its on-line poker gamers, which is why we have placed a restrict on your maximum deposit quantity.

New gamers can brush up on the poker rules and study poker technique from the pros. If this is the case with Rummy, then at the very least surely it needs to be the identical for poker. There is no entry charge for this Indian Poker league and there is good prize cash at stake. Whereas land-based poker video games in India are restricted to on line casino ships, these online poker rooms are outdoors the jurisdiction of the government, so gamers in India are protected utilizing them.
But it is nonetheless very early days… all of us within the Indian Poker neighborhood are actually hoping that the Government will move a bill to link poker to the Indian laws on Rummy in that poker is extra of a recreation of skill slightly than chance. Numerous states reminiscent of Maharashtra, Kerala and Hyderabad and at present discussing potentialities of legalizing on-line gambling in their respective states as state government’s realize they might be bringing vital amount of income in gaming taxes.

Along with Spartan Poker Crew Mentor Rohit Bhalla, the addition of Mohan as Staff Professional has powered up this new workforce and will probably be anticipated to do some great things within the coming months. Two Indian states, Goa and Sikkim, produce other types of playing, so India differs from a variety of other countries, this fashion, and therefore we will not communicate of a typical practice or laws in India in the direction of playing as we often do. Now gamers are free to play regulated real money online poker video games with none worries!
And in a hand-over-hand scenario, Lawrence Sanjay’s (9h 9s) dominated and held up towards Paras Kumar’s (4c 4d) giving Lawrence his first title at the India Poker Championship.

I have developed the tendency when grabbing a lens for the day to grab the most un-coated one I have. I don't know whether it is because the coatings are detracting from the image or whether the older lens are simply better or maybe I am a bit of a Luddite and like old stuff. I suspect it is the coating because my 28mm of choice is a Takumar Bayonet 28mm 2.8 which I put ahead of both my M28 3.5s and equal to better than my A 28mm. Once more an uncoated lens. Unfortunately with the reviews you can't really tell if coating is making a difference to people.
I agree that it's the coatings. My uncoated 1947 Kodak Anastigmat 50mm/3.5 that I've converted to K mount gives me the most perfect colour rendering of all the lenses I own.

The Embassy Cafe + Bakery serves Eastern and Western simple, healthy and hearty meals including fine cakes and bread. The Embassy is a family friendly, PORK FREE and WIFI enabled.

Inspired by the warmth and gracious hospitality of embassies from around the world, The Embassy café seeks to bring the exciting spirit of the journey, adventure, friendship and comfort through its food and interior space.


With a nature theme and the signature usage of lines in the interior design, The Embassy infuses natural clean lines that symbolise the fluidity of time, space and evolution that connects all of us in our daily journey and adventure. The Embassy offers cuisine from East & West that blends a culinary combination of something for everybody on one menu.



Our review started off with an order of the cool Iced Mocha RM 14.00 which is matched with our breakfast set.



The Breakfast set that we ordered to taste is the Ambassador's Big Breakfast  RM 28.00. Our orders came with 2 sunny sides up, toasted sourdough; with 2 pieces of hash brown, beef bacon, chicken bratwurst, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes and baked beans.



Next; we decided to order a salad which is the Oriental Grilled Ribeye Salad RM 24.00. This salad is a little heavy as it comes with streaks of grill rib-eye that is accompanied with fresh leafy greens, tomatoes, cucumber and cilantro served with sesame-soy dressing. A balance salad which can easily be a meal for small eaters.



Next, comes the mains which I ordered the SynFull Roast Chicken for a half chicken portion (RM 35.00). For the smaller eater, you can order the quarter chicken set (RM26.00). You can see that this is a real treat as the skin was a roast to a nice crisp while the meat was still juicy and succulent. We can taste the strong flavor of the spices and herbs marinade that was imbued into the meat. This wholesome meal is served with seasonal vegetables, rosemary butter potatoes and served with a creamy mushroom sauce.



For those that loves the carbs; can order a pasta which we had is the Carbonara (RM 22.00). For those that loves the cheesy feel of the Carbonara sauce will attest to this dish. The pasta was cooked with a smooth cheesy cream sauce,  mushrooms, Parmesan cheese and topped with beef bacon. I am not a big fan of pasta, but this one hit the right note for me.



Our last main was the Embassy Nasi Istimewa RM 28.00. Here at Embassy, they do provide a number of local delights. Apparently, the recipe of these dishes is from one of the owner's mothers which she has meticulously trained the chef to cook it at close as possible to her recipe. This Nasi Istimewa is served with the Ayam Pindang together with fried rice, anchovies, Tempe Sambal, fried cabbage, Papadams, Kerabu Mangga and topped with sunny side egg. I would have preferred the dish served with plain white rice, as it will be more tasteful.



By the time we tasted the last mains, we were too full to even order our dessert.

The change comes after a passenger, Dr. David Dao, was dragged from a fully-booked United Express flight in Chicago because he refused to give up his seat to make room for crew members. Cellphone video of the incident sparked widespread outrage and created a public-relations nightmare for United.
Under the change outlined in an internal April 14 email, a crew member must make must-ride bookings at least 60 minutes prior to departure. Crews could previously be booked until the time of departure.

In 1990, Marshall Industries (NYSE:MI, 1984–1999) CEO Robert Rodin trained with the then 90-year-old Deming and his colleague Nida Backaitis. Marshall Industries' dramatic transformation and growth from $400 million to $1.8 billion in sales was chronicled in Deming's last book The New Economics, a Harvard Case Study, and Rodin's book, Free, Perfect and Now.
In 1993, Deming published his final book, The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education, which included the System of Profound Knowledge and the 14 Points for Management. It also contained educational concepts involving group-based teaching without grades, as well as management without individual merit or performance reviews.
Deming died in his sleep at the age of 93 in his Washington home from cancer on December 20, 1993.[25] When asked, toward the end of his life, how he would wish to be remembered in the U.S., he replied, ""I probably won't even be remembered."" After a pause, he added, ""Well, maybe ... as someone who spent his life trying to keep America from committing suicide.""[26] More...",,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9zpNrFFAOBHI5LQPIInmPE9p9OJxFdjON_zog.tzyZnk4K8fIM7SlvZ.5HVY_rtVwGaK95DY_xWkvzhG8mrT27aLREegbkKYPMWgX6.eOag--,ca680b1c7304a8a7c4044ec11747f3f1a669e8cb,www.elitetrader.com,,https://www.elitetrader.com/et/forums/wall-st-news.44/,Wall St. News | Elite Trader,US,59522.0,0,elitetrader.com,2,United Airlines ( UAL) | Page 13 | Elite Trader,0.004,discussions,2,[],[],[]

Data Sources: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from their inception up to August 15, 2016 for SSD, BCD, and their synonyms. Study Selection: In total, 523 articles were retrieved, of which 12 satisfied the eligibility quality criteria. Our outcomes of interest were: 1) the BCD implantation rejection percentage, 2) reasons to reject BCD implantation, and 3) possible prognostic factors predicting the trial outcome. Data Extraction and Synthesis: At critical appraisal, six studies (n = 471 patients) scored a moderate to high directness of evidence and a medium or low risk of bias and were selected for data extraction. Due to heterogeneity between studies, pooling of data for meta-analysis was not feasible. Therefore, results of studies were summarized per outcome: 1) after the BCD trial, 32.0 to 69.6% of SSD patients rejected BCD implantation, 2) the three main reasons for rejection were experiencing limited benefit from the device, patients fearing or being unfit for surgery and cosmetic aspects, 3) no clear prognostic factors predicting the trial outcome could be identified. Conclusion: Roughly half of patients rejected BCD implantation after a trial period. From the current literature it is unclear which patients could benefit most from BCD implantation. High level of evidence studies should be conducted to investigate possible prognostic factors that predict the BCD trial outcome. Copyright (C) 2017 by Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

You might conclude that it is after reading Verizon's privacy policy on an upcoming AppFlash service, which promises easier access to search and apps on Android phones. The policy says Verizon may share data on features and services you use, along with the list of apps you have installed on your phone, with other Verizon businesses to target ads. 
The privacy watchdog Electronic Frontier Foundation described AppFlash as ""spyware."" 
Not so fast, Verizon says. In a statement to clarify its intentions, Verizon says users must explicitly grant permission before using AppFlash. Verizon says customers will be able to easily disable the service, and no one will be required to use it. 
The statement, however, doesn't say exactly what permission Verizon is seeking. The privacy policy says users can control AppFlash's access to your location and contact information, but says nothing about giving control over broader usage data. At most, users can turn off ad tracking on the phone by digging through the settings. 
The EFF has since retracted Thursday's blog post, pending further investigation. The group had said AppFlash represents Verizon's intention ""to start monetizing its customers' private data as soon as possible."" The post came just days after Congress voted to block Obama-era restrictions on what internet-access companies like Verizon could do with information about you. 
Verizon has gotten heat over user privacy before. Last year, Verizon agreed to pay a $1.35 million fine over a ""supercookie"" that federal regulators said followed phone customers on the internet without their permission. 
The complaints come as Verizon evolves into an advertising business, with the purchase of AOL in 2015 and the upcoming acquisition of Yahoo's internet businesses. Verizon, in knowing what web sites and apps you use, could charge companies more for ads that are targeted to your personal habits. 
Android phones and iPhones already come with search services similar to AppFlash. The main difference is when people use AppFlash, Verizon gets more data on your interactions and can target ads accordingly. 
AppFlash is a Verizon-branded version of Evie Launcher, which people can already get through the Android app store. After installation, one swipe from a phone edge brings up a search bar; one search pulls content from the web and installed apps at once. For instance, after searching for the movie ""Beauty and the Beast,"" Evie offers one-tap access to buy tickets through Fandango or to read reviews through IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes. 
Verizon says AppFlash will be tested initially on a single phone, LG's K20 V. Verizon has offered no details on its plans beyond that, though the app is for Android only and Apple forbids carriers from shipping iPhones with their own apps already installed. 
While Verizon promises to seek permission, it's not yet known how Verizon will do that and how clear it will be in explaining what's being collected and how it will be used. 
Evie Launcher does ask permission to access location and contact information, and you can say no. It also asks for permission to replace the regular home screen experience for launching individual apps. However, Evie says nothing about privacy during the setup; its privacy policy online says personal information such as usage activity and search queries will be collected, but not shared with third parties. 
For those who use AppFlash, Verizon says data collected may be shared with other Verizon businesses for ad targeting.

Discover the most essential attributes to consider when selecting a colocation provider. MORE IN CUSTOMER DATA Canadian Accused in Yahoo Hack Has Bail Hearing By Rob Gillies 05 2017 A Canadian man accused in a massive hack of Yahoo emails said Wednesday he'll live with his parents and forgo access to phones and any electronic equipment if he's allowed out on bail. 
Officials allege that Karim Baratov poses an ""extremely high flight risk"" because of his alleged ties to Russian agents. 
But his lawyer Amedeo DiCarlo said that Baratov has never been to Russia and he will not flee if freed on bail. Baratov arrived in court for his bail wearing a black shirt and sweat pants with his legs shackled. His parents provided him with a dress jacket. 
""Flight risk is the issue,"" DiCarlo told reporters after arriving at the courthouse in a chauffeured Rolls Royce. ""We are going to have measures put in place so that is not going to happen."" 
Baratov's parents have agreed to act as their son's sureties. His father, Akhmet Tokbergenov, has agreed to turn off the internet in the family home if that's what the court requests. 
Baratov, 22, said he registered an internet business in 2014 that made about $81,000 ($110,000 Canadian) that year registering websites, renting web spaces and preventing web servers from hack attempts. He said he made less in in 2015 and 2016. He was not asked directly about the allegations against him. 
U.S. law enforcement officials call Baratov a ""hacker-for-hire"" paid by Russian Federal Security Service members. He has Kazakh origins, arriving in Canada in 2007 and becoming a citizen in 2011. 
Baratov was arrested last month and faces extradition to the U.S. The breach at Yahoo affected at least a half billion user accounts. 
He was indicted in the United States for computer hacking along with three other people, including two alleged Russian intelligence agents. 
Officials have said Baratov has the money to leave Canada and the ability to destroy evidence related to his alleged activities while on the run. 
Prosecutor Heather Graham said police seized about $22,000 ($30,000 Canadian) cash from his home and another $670 ($900 Canadian) from his wallet when he was arrested. 
Baratov said he had virtually nothing in his bank accounts and testified that he largely financed a string of luxury cars that included a Lamborghini Diablo, an Austin Martin and a Mercedes Benz. He said half of the money he paid for the cars came from his parents. He also said half the $95,000 ($128,000 Canadian) down payment on a three-bedroom house came from his parents. 
Social media pictures of Baratov show him as an exotic car buff. His Facebook and Instagram profiles were peppered with photos of cars. 
Graham noted that Baratov posted online that he travels to Russia often but Baratov testified he has never been to Russia and only posted that on behalf of a friend to get advice. 
In a scheme that prosecutors say blended intelligence gathering with old-fashioned financial greed, the four men targeted the email accounts of Russian and U.S. government officials, Russian journalists and employees of financial services and other private businesses, American officials said. 
In some cases using a technique known as ""spear-phishing"" to dupe Yahoo users into thinking they were receiving legitimate emails, the hackers broke into at least 500 million accounts in search of personal information and financial data such as gift card and credit card numbers, prosecutors said. 
The case, announced amid continued U.S. intelligence agency skepticism of their Russian counterparts, comes as American authorities investigate Russian interference through hacking in the 2016 presidential election. Officials said those investigations are separate. 
Alexsey Belan, one of the others accused, is on the list of the FBI's most wanted cyber criminals and has been indicted multiple times in the United States. It's not clear whether he or the other two defendants, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, will ever step foot in an American courtroom because there's no extradition treaty with Russia. 
The indictment identifies Dokuchaev and Sushchin as officers of the Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB. Belan and Baratov were paid hackers directed by the FSB to break into the accounts, prosecutors said.

You might conclude that it is after reading Verizon's privacy policy on an upcoming AppFlash service, which promises easier access to search and apps on Android phones. The policy says Verizon may share data on features and services you use, along with the list of apps you have installed on your phone, with other Verizon businesses to target ads. 
The privacy watchdog Electronic Frontier Foundation described AppFlash as ""spyware."" 
Not so fast, Verizon says. In a statement to clarify its intentions, Verizon says users must explicitly grant permission before using AppFlash. Verizon says customers will be able to easily disable the service, and no one will be required to use it. 
The statement, however, doesn't say exactly what permission Verizon is seeking. The privacy policy says users can control AppFlash's access to your location and contact information, but says nothing about giving control over broader usage data. At most, users can turn off ad tracking on the phone by digging through the settings. 
The EFF has since retracted Thursday's blog post, pending further investigation. The group had said AppFlash represents Verizon's intention ""to start monetizing its customers' private data as soon as possible."" The post came just days after Congress voted to block Obama-era restrictions on what internet-access companies like Verizon could do with information about you.

0,washingtonpost blogs,2017-04-16T08:47:28.000+03:00,[],,,english,0,2017-04-15T03:00:00.000+03:00,,"April 15 After weeks of waiting, Michele Sexton finally receives the piece of mail she’s been waiting for.
The Perryville resident pulls out a large orange envelope filled with a crumbled paper ramekin, a map, a redacted news article.
She fumbles with a smaller already-opened envelope labeled “friend” and removes an eerie letter. It’s written by a serial killer-type, and this won’t be the last she hears from him.
Luckily, it’s all just a game — and Sexton, 45, is just one of around 7,000 players of this monthly mystery subscription box.
Launched in October 2016 by Ryan Hogan and Derrick Smith, co-founders of Essex-based entertainment company Hunt a Killer, the mystery box program sends members monthly boxes that are carefully curated with an array of clues and a letter from a Hannibal Lecter-esque narrator. Each box plays into an indefinite story line, creating a community of “hunters” from across the world who hope to get to the bottom of the mystery.
Hogan, a Bel Air native who now resides in San Diego, compares the concept to a TV show, with the boxes acting as episodes that will eventually be categorized into “seasons” or chapters.
“You’ve got television, you’ve got movies, you’ve got books — a few short mediums [and] ways to communicate to tell stories and absorb stories. We’re kind of reinventing the way of storytelling, and we’re telling it through touch and smell and actual physical items,” said Hogan, 32.
The membership program, which ranges from $25 to $30 per month, is an expansion of the Hunt a Killer company that Hogan and Smith launched last year. Hoping to capitalize on the growing interest in true-crime storytelling, interactive entertainment like escape rooms, and the fanfare surrounding projects such as the “Serial” podcast, Hunt a Killer hosted a live event at Camp Ramblewood in Darlington, where participants worked to solve a murder mystery.
Knowing some people couldn’t make the event, Hogan and Smith began to brainstorm other ways to reach customers. They decided on a subscription-based box, joining companies like beauty product sample service Birchbox and snack curating company Graze that deliver products and experiences directly to their customers.
Smith, 33, of Hamilton, thought of a plot line and enlisted Towson University graduate student Adam Mueller, 32, to be the senior writer behind the mystery boxes, which launched in mid-October. As of April, around 7,000 members from all over the world are playing the game, and more than 25,000 users are convening on the company’s private Facebook group, which acts as a place to trade tips and information and an introduction to many new “hunters.”
“There’s a great community that you can build,” said Jo ­Rothermal of Abbotsford in British Columbia, Canada, a player who also created an online forum on the Hunt a Killer website for hunters to chat about their findings and experiences.
Rothermal, 47, said the game has been a great alternative to escape rooms, which is often more enjoyable with friends. Hunt a Killer’s mystery box can be done individually or with the aid of a group or the growing online community. Either way, the boxes are challenging, she said.
“If you want a quick fix, something that you can cancel at any time, this is not for you. You have to be dedicated to it,” she said.
Subscription members receive a boxed-set of clues from a fictional one-sided pen-pal, who sends photographs, maps, articles, investigative tools and other objects, many of which have links to the Baltimore area and real-life organizations and events. (A Baltimore Sun article about a Mount Vernon sinkhole is included in Box 1).
Each box is just one part of an indefinite story that players have to piece together; meaning that, although there are payoffs, the mystery never ends, Hogan said. (He likened it to an ongoing television series.)
“You could assume some crazy stuff if you look at what’s in the boxes,” said Sexton, of Perryville. “It tests your mental capabilities in a different way. It’s not just a clean, solve-this puzzle. You have to think.”
Krystal Henning, an avid viewer of true-crime shows including “Cops” and the Investigation Discovery channel, said she has spent at least a few hours a night for about three weeks on the first two boxes. Now she’s awaiting the third.
“There’s been quite a bit of ‘aha!’ moments. .?.?. My favorite part is being able to open the box with my kids. It’s a whole family moment of ‘Ooh, what did we get this month?’ They want to analyze everything,” said Henning, 32, of Adamstown in Frederick County.
The mastermind behind many of these boxes is Mueller, who said he conducts a lot of research before beginning to write, sometimes using codes.
“I try to make sure we don’t repeat anything we’ve done before. There are themes that pop up again and again. .?.?. It forces us to think outside of the box,” Mueller said.
As far as channeling Hunt a Killer’s sinister narrator, “I kind of just get into a really dark place,” Mueller said. “All of the horror movies as a kid, anything that’s scared me growing up. .?.?. There’s a little bit of acting involved.”
Needless to say, the game is not for the faint of heart. Within the first month of launching the subscription box, on Oct. 26, Hogan said the company received a message from the Harford County sheriff’s office about an older woman who became frightened after receiving one of the boxes at her home. Harford County police spokesperson Kyle Andersen confirmed that the police responded to her home and took the box in for further investigation, only to later find that a relative sent the game as a gift.
To avoid such situations, Hogan said potential players have to apply online and are encouraged to join the Hunt a Killer’s official, private Facebook group, which has up to 500 people joining daily, to take a look around while the game organizers review their application, Hogan said.
“It allows us to control growth .?.?. and the last thing we want is for people to join, have no idea what it is and when they have the first box, throw it out,” Hogan said.
The company, which employs 13 people, plans to expand the Hunt a Killer experience with a three-day live event in October, which will transform a 200-acre campground in Darlington into a live crime scene that immerses participants in an alternative reality. Around 3,400 people are expected to attend, he said. (The story line is separate but might show some parallels to the subscription boxes, Hogan said.)
And for those who prefer to explore the mystery in bulk, the company has recently announced its premium one-time mystery box “Hunt a Killer 1934,” which is set in the 1930s. For now, it’s available only to current subscribers.
Jess Brandt of Westland, Mich., who is awaiting the sixth box, said while she probably won’t make it to the live event later this year, the game has and will continue to be a pastime for her, her friends and her family — especially during the bitter Michigan winter, when there isn’t much to do.
“A lot of times we’ll meet up at a coffee shop, or someone’s house. It’ll be two to three weeks of going through everything to make sure we covered everything,” said Brandt, 31.
For her, it’s a gift that keeps on giving, she said — an experience that lasts longer than something like a dinner date or going to the movies.
“It’s not all solvable in one box or episode. I can go back and .?.?. see if I missed anything. There’s still stuff in Episode 5 that I haven’t figured out,” Brandt said. “It’s probably one of the top things, as far as the value, that I’ve had in a while.”

https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/10215/islam-multiculturalism-britain-march “Have you seen some of those ISIS propaganda videos, they are cut like action movies. Where is the counter narrative?” — Riz Ahmed, actor. Britain’s foreign aid budget is reportedly funding at least two dozen Palestinian schools, some of which are named after terrorists and murderers and which openly promote terrorism and encourage pupils to see child killers as role models. An estimated 400 home-grown jihadis have returned to the United Kingdom after fighting in Syria, but only 54 of those have been prosecuted, according to a Mail on Sunday investigation, which also discovered that some returned jihadis are roaming free on the streets of Britain. 
March 1. A new Channel 4 documentary series called “ Extremely British Muslims ” showed the inner workings of a sharia court inside Birmingham’s Central Mosque. In the first episode, viewers witnessed the case of mother-of-four Fatima, 33, as she sought permission to divorce her drug dealer husband she says has abused her throughout their 14-year marriage. According to sharia law, Muslim women must plead their divorce cases in court, while Muslim men need only to say the words “I divorce you” three times to obtain a divorce. Birmingham Central Mosque said it allowed the sharia proceedings to be filmed in an effort to “break down misconceptions about Islam.” Some 100 sharia courts in Britain are now dispensing Islamic justice outside the remit of the British legal system. 
March 2. English actor Riz Ahmed warned that the lack of Muslim faces on British television was alienating young people, driving them towards extremism and into the arms of the Islamic State. Delivering Channel 4’s annual diversity lecture in Parliament, Ahmed said that television had a pivotal role to play in ensuring that Muslims felt heard, and valued, in British society: 
“If we fail to represent, we are in danger of losing people to extremism. In the mind of the ISIS recruit, he’s the next James Bond right? Have you seen some of those ISIS propaganda videos, they are cut like action movies. Where is the counter narrative? Where are we telling these kids they can be heroes in our stories — that they are valued? If we don’t step up and tell a representative story we are going to start losing British teenagers to the story that the next chapter in their lives is written with ISIS in Syria.” 
March 3. The Amateur Swimming Association changed its swimsuit regulations to allow Muslim women to wear full body outfits, after a request from the Muslim Women’s Sport Foundation. The rule was changed to encourage more Muslim women to take part in the sport. Rimla Akhtar, from the Muslim Women’s Sport Foundation, said: 
“Participation in sport amongst Muslim women is increasing at a rapid pace. It is imperative that governing bodies adapt and tailor their offerings to suit the changing landscape of sport, including those who access their sport.” 
March 4. Ryan Counsell, 28, a jihadist from Nottingham who left his wife and two small children to fight with the Abu Sayyaf Islamist group in the Philippines, blamed his behavior on the Brexit vote. He told the Woolwich Crown Court that increased tension within the local Muslim community after Brexit sparked his decision to leave. He said that he wanted to escape Britain’s political climate and seek an “idyllic life” under sharia law. He was arrested at Stansted airport in July 2016 and was later sentenced to eight years in prison. 
March 5. Homegrown terrorism inspired by the Islamic State poses the dominant threat to the national security of the United Kingdom, according to a comprehensive new report on violent Islamism in Britain. The 1,000-page report — “Islamist Terrorism: Analysis of Offenses and Attacks in the UK (1998–2015)” — was published by the Henry Jackson Society, a foreign policy think tank based in London. 
The report found that number of Islamism-related offenses (IROs) in Britain doubled between 2011 and 2015 from 12 to 23 a year. More than half (52%) of IROs were committed by individuals of South Asian ancestry: British-Pakistanis (25%) and British-Bangladeshis (8%). Other offenders had family ties to countries in Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean. Forty-seven percent of IROs were committed by individuals born in the UK. 
The also report showed a clear link between terrorism and growing up in Muslim-dominated neighborhoods. London was the place of residence of 43% of IROs, followed by West Midlands, with 18%. Of the latter, 80% of IROs were in Birmingham. The third most common region was North West England, with 10% of IROs. Together, these three regions contained the residences in almost three-quarters (72%) of cases. East London was home to half (50%) the London-based offenders, while the three most common boroughs — Tower Hamlets, Newham and Waltham Forest — contained the residence of offenders’ in 38% of all London IROs (and 16% overall). 
March 6. British security services have prevented 13 potential terror attacks since June 2013, according to Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, the UK’s most senior counter-terrorism police officer. He also said that there were 500 live counter-terror investigations at any given time, and that investigators have been arresting terror suspects at a rate of close to one a day since 2014. The official threat level for international terrorism in the UK has stood at severe — meaning an attack is “highly likely” — for more than two years. 
March 7. The National Health Service (NHS) revealed that there were 2,332 new cases of female genital mutilation (FGM) in Britain between October and December 2016. That brought the total of new cases in 2016 to nearly 5,500. 
March 7. The managers of the cash-strapped Sandwell General Hospital near Birmingham are considering the construction of a special kitchen for preparing halal meals for Muslim patients and staff. The move follows complaints about the quality of halal meals that the hospital has outsourced to local vendors. A spokesman said: “We are still reviewing options around creating a separate halal kitchen and the best ways to provide a range of healthy halal options to patients and staff who want them.” 
March 10. The BBC announced that it would begin outsourcing production of Songs of Praise, a Sunday worship program that has been produced in-house for 55 years. Critics of the move said they feared that Songs of Praise will lose its Christian focus in favor of Islam. Anglican priest Lynda Rose said a recent Songs of Praise episode featuring a segment about the Muslim faith, including Church of England children visiting a mosque, exemplified the “Islamization of the BBC.” More than 6,000 people have signed an online petition calling for MPs to investigate the BBC after it appointed Fatima Salaria as the BBC’s head of religious programming — the second Muslim in a row to hold the post. 
March 11. Britain’s foreign aid budget is reportedly funding at least two dozen Palestinian schools, some of which are named after terrorists and murderers and which openly promote terrorism and encourage pupils to see child killers as role models. A Mail on Sunday investigation found pictures of “martyrs” posted on school walls, revolutionary slogans and symbols painted on premises used by youngsters, sports events named after teenage terrorists and children encouraged to act out shooting Israeli soldiers in plays. 
Head teachers openly admitted to flouting attempts by British and European donors to control the curriculum at schools. They reportedly print overtly political study aids for pupils, some even denying the existence of Israel, while teachers boast of encouraging pupils to emulate teenage “martyrs” killed in terrorist attacks in the region. 
One senior teacher from a prominent West Bank school, when asked what he would say to a pupil threatening to attack Israelis, said: “I would tell them go in the name of Allah.” 
March 11. Islamic preachers may be asked to begin delivering their sermons in English under measures being prepared to rid Britain of hate preaching. The Telegraph reported that the government’s counter-extremism taskforce is working on the plans amid concern that preaching in foreign languages enforces divisions between Islam and mainstream British society and can foster radicalization. 
March 12. An Islamic bookstore in Alum Rock, a predominately Muslim suburb of Birmingham that has produced 10% of all of Britain’s convicted terrorists, was found to be openly selling books promoting jihad. The Sunday Express visited the Madina Book Centre and bought a copy of the 440-page “Bringing up Children in Islam” for £5 ($6). The book encourages parents to “keep alive in the children the spirit of jihad.” It says: 
“They [your children] may be inspired to strive for the restoration of the glory of Islam and Muslims. Jihad of warfare is where all humans spend their energies to stop a tyrant from being oppressive, for example when a tyrant makes it difficult for people to fulfill the commands of Allah to propagate Islam. 
“Tyrants must be subdued whether they rule in an Islamic or non-Islamic land, or whether they are on a battlefield. 
“It is the duty of Muslims to divert people from worshipping created things to the worship of the Almighty Allah alone.” 
The book also rails against cinema and theater, arguing they are the work of “evil-minded” Jews, and warns of a Jewish conspiracy to take over the world. The book supports adulterers being stoned to death and Muslim schoolchildren being kept separate from others: “Education under unbelieving and atheist teachers results in them going astray. Dangerous, communistic and materialistic ideas grow in their minds.” 
March 14. A father who describes himself as “Anglo-Saxon” lost a legal battle to prevent his Muslim ex-wife from sending their 10-year-old son to an Islamic secondary school. The man, who was not named for legal reasons, said he wanted to prevent his son from attending a “school inside a mosque” on the grounds that he would be “marginalized” by his son if he enrolled at the London-based school. The man’s lawyer said that the mother and father had “different world views” and that it was client’s wish that his son be educated in a “neutral” environment. The man and his ex-wife, both in their 40s, had divorced more than three years ago following a nine-year marriage. The man had converted to Islam but renounced his faith following the separation. The lawyer argued that the boy’s Muslim faith could be adequately catered for at a secular school. A High Court judge dismissed the man’s appeal on the grounds that an earlier ruling made by a judge at a family court — that the man would not be marginalized by his son — was correct. 
March 15. Lawyers warned that a landmark ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which allows employers to ban staff from wearing Islamic headscarves at work under certain conditions, will not automatically apply in Britain. The ECJ ruled that prohibiting the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination. The judgment was delivered in cases brought by two employees, one in Belgium and one in France, who were dismissed for refusing to remove headscarves. Lawyers said that British companies adopting the ban could easily be sued for discrimination. The Muslim Council of Britain, the country’s largest Islamic organization, condemned the ruling: 
“At a time when populism and bigotry are at an all-time high, we fear that this ruling will serve as a green light to those wishing to normalize discrimination against faith communities. Many will be worried that this action will prevent Muslim women who choose to wear the scarf from securing jobs. And it sends a message that we cannot accept a plural society that recognizes and celebrates religious differences.” 
Prime Minister Theresa May said that the government should not tell women what to wear: 
“We have a strong tradition in this country of freedom of expression, and it is the right of all women to choose how they dress and we don’t intend to legislate on this issue. There will be times when it is right for a veil to be asked to be removed, such as border security or perhaps in courts, and individual institutions can make their own policies, but it is not for government to tell women what they can and can’t wear.” 
March 17. The former owners of a bookstore in Bradford apologized after copies of the Koran and other Islamic literature were found in a garbage dumpster outside the store. Police were called to the store after a group of Muslim males began shouting at and abusing staff. The imbroglio began after the bookstore’s 80-year-old owner decided to close down his business, and the new owners gave him a month to move out the stock, which included a number of Korans and other Islamic books. A spokesman for the bookstore said: 
“It has come to our attention that some Islamic materials were found in a skip [garbage dumpster] next to Book Centre. While the Book Centre site is being cleared, no Islamic material of any sort was purposefully disposed of. A small workforce was instructed to clear two storerooms from which some material made its way into the skip. This is wrong, unacceptable and a genuine mistake. The skip will be looked at as a matter of urgency and any materials removed.” 
A spokesman for Baker Reign Solicitors, which represents the new owners, said: 
“Should our client have been aware that the previous owner would have sought to dispose of the Holy Koran and other books in this manner, they would have assisted in distributing the books to various mosques throughout the city. 
“Our client now hopes that the previous owner takes a more responsible course of action by distributing the books to those less fortunate and in need of Islamic guidance.” 
March 17. Zameer Ghumra, a 37-year-old Leicester pharmacist accused of showing a beheading video to two young children, was released on bail until his trial begins at Nottingham Crown Court on September 25. He has been charged with distributing terrorist publications under section two of the Terrorism Act 2006. 
March 18. The BBC apologized after a tweet from the BBC Asian Network account asked, “What is the right punishment for blasphemy?” The tweet provoked criticism that the BBC appeared to be endorsing harsh restrictions on speech. In an apology posted on Twitter, the network said it had intended to debate concerns about blasphemy on social media in Pakistan. “We never intended to imply that blasphemy should be punished,” it said. On March 18, the British taxpayer-funded BBC Asian Network account asked, “What is the right punishment for blasphemy?” 
March 19. A British jihadist reportedly used social welfare payments to move his family to Syria to join the Islamic State. Shahan Choudhury, 30, who was radicalized at Belmarsh Prison while serving an 18-month sentence for allegedly stabbing to death a 17-year-old hospital worker over an alleged £15 ($18) drug debt, vanished from his apartment in London and has since used social media to urge other British Muslims to carry out terror attacks in the UK. 
March 20. Mohammed Karamat, 45, an imam at a mosque in Coventry who assaulted four children as young as nine, was spared jail time. Magistrates watched footage of Karamat twisting a child’s arm, slapping a child, and using a pen to stab a child and pricking a child’s hand with the lid of a pen. He was filmed attacking the children during a six-day period. Karamat, who admitted to four counts of assault by beating, was ordered to do 100 hours unpaid work. 
March 21. Minister for Higher Education, Jo Johnson, ordered British universities to include a clear commitment to freedom of speech in their governance documents to counter the culture of censorship and so-called safe spaces. In a letter, Johnson wrote that it was the “legal duty” of universities to ensure as far as practicable that freedom of speech is secured for “members, students, employees and visiting speakers.” This meant that all university premises should not be “denied to any individual or body on any grounds connected with their beliefs or views, policy or objective.” 
March 22. Khalid Masood, 52, drove a car at pedestrians on London’s Westminster Bridge and, armed with two knives, stormed the parliamentary estate. He killed five people and injured more than 50 before he was shot dead by police. Masood, a convert to Islam, was born in Kent as Adrian Elms. During his school years, he used his stepfather’s surname, Adrian Russell Ajao. A former English tutor, he was unemployed at the time of the attack and had been living on social welfare benefits. Masood, who had a history of criminality — he had previous convictions for assaults, including grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences — was reportedly radicalized in prison. 
March 23. A total of 29 people were charged after girls as young as 11 were raped and sexually abused in Huddersfield. West Yorkshire Police said the 27 men and two women men face numerous offences including rape, trafficking with intent to engage in sexual exploitation, sexual activity with a child, child neglect, child abduction, supply of Class A drugs and the possession and making of indecent images of children. They are accused of committing the crimes against 18 girls in Huddersfield when they were aged between 11 and 17, between 2004 and 2011. 
March 23. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Westminster attack. “The perpetrator of the attacks yesterday in front of the British parliament in London is an Islamic State soldier and he carried out the operation in response to calls to target citizens of the coalition,” the group’s Amaq news agency said in a statement. 
March 23. Prime Minister Theresa May said that it would be “wrong” to describe the jihadist attack on Westminster Bridge and Parliament as “Islamic terrorism.” Instead, she said, it should be referred to as “Islamist terrorism” and “a perversion of a great faith.” 
March 25. Mark Ashdown, a childhood friend of Westminster terrorist Khalid Masood, described how Masood had completely changed after prison, where he converted to Islam. Ashdown said : 
“When he first came out he told me he’d become a Muslim in prison and I thought he was joking. Then I saw he was quieter and much more serious. I gave him some cash-in-hand work for a few months as a laborer. He said he needed time to pray and read the Koran — something about finding inner peace. I heard he’d split from his partner and got even more deeply into religion.” 
March 25. Police investigating the Westminster attack concluded that Khalid Masood acted entirely alone for reasons that may never be known. “We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never understand why he did this,” deputy assistant Metropolitan police commissioner Neil Basu said. “That understanding may have died with him.” Meanwhile, British security services reportedly do not like the term “lone wolf” because they feel it glamorizes an attacker. They prefer using “lone actor” instead. 
March 25. An estimated 400 home-grown jihadis have returned to the United Kingdom after fighting in Syria, but only 54 of those have been prosecuted, according to a Mail on Sunday investigation, which also discovered that some returned jihadis are roaming free on the streets of Britain. 
March 28. Kevin Lane, a convicted murderer who spent 20 years in British prisons, including HMP Woodhill and HMP Frankland, told the BBC that he saw many inmates pressured to convert to Islam and carry out attacks on other prisoners. “I have seen many attacks within the prison system,” he said. “One man boiled fat and poured it over someone’s head because of an insult to Islam.” A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: “The allegations put forward by the former prisoner are historic.” 
March 29. The BBC tried to downplay Westminster attacker Khalid Masood’s ties to radical Islam by airing an interview with a former employer of Massood. The man, identified only as Farasat, was a manager at an English language school where Massood worked between 2010 and 2012: The interview follows: 
Q: Who was the man that you knew? 
A: As a teacher, a very professional man. He was an excellent teacher. He got on well with his non-Muslim colleagues. A very friendly, stable kind of guy, really. He was not interested in the politicized version of Islam. He had no contact with any of the extremist groups. He was more a practicing Muslim who was committed to his faith, committed to his family and was focused on his career. I don’t think he was influenced by extremist groups at all…. In fact, I’d go as far to say that he was the antithesis of a violent radical. 
Masood was, in fact, known to police and security services and had once been investigated by MI5 over concerns about violent extremism. 
March 30. Acting Metropolitan Police Commissioner Craig Mackey said there was a slight increase in “Islamophobic incidents” following the Westminster terror attack. Breitbart London reported : “The statement which New Scotland Yard sent along with its figures suggests the rise may not be due to a genuine increase in Islamophobia, but could instead be due to a ‘community engagement plan’ which sees the authorities actively encourage Muslims to come forward with allegations following what they describe as ‘trigger events.'” The Met, the police service for the Greater London area, now employs 900 specialists focused on monitoring so-called Islamophobia. 
March 31. A new biography of Prince Charles revealed that the heir to the British throne tried to halt the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan to “honor” Ramadan. He made the plea in an “urgent call” to William Farish, the American ambassador to London, four weeks into the huge military operation launched after the 9/11 terror attacks. Farish recalled: “Prince Charles asked me if it would be possible to stop the invasion to honor Ramadan, and if I could convey that request to President Bush.” The ambassador replied that it would be difficult to halt a military invasion already in full swing, but the prince allegedly protested: “But Americans can do anything!” Farish asked: “Sir, are you really serious?” Prince Charles replied: “Yes I am.”

BERKELEY (CBS SF) — A pro-Trump group known as the Proud Boys sponsored the protest that descended into bloody violence at Berkeley’s Civic Center Park on Saturday. They say they have a right to bring their views to liberal Berkeley. 
According to the description on their Facebook page , “The Proud Boys are a fraternal organization founded on a system of beliefs and values of minimal government, maximum freedom, anti-political correctness, anti-racial guilt, pro-gun rights, anti-Drug War, closed borders, anti-masturbation, venerating entrepreneurs, venerating housewives, and reinstating a spirit of Western chauvinism during an age of globalism and multiculturalism.” 
Saturday’s melee in Berkeley, was similar to recent clashes between left and right-wing factions in the recent past. There is almost a script to how these rallies and counter-protests go in Berkeley. 
KPIX 5 asked Tom Marcianno of Fremont, who took part in Saturday’s rally, if his group was intentionally trying to provoke a reaction by bringing a pro-Trump message and gathering to the heart of liberal Berkeley. 
Q: Coming to Berkeley, isn’t that like poking the bear? 
A: Well, it is in a way, but, we’re not doing it to be gleeful about it or to deliberately upset people who are against us. We have every right to be here. 
Q: But you are going to upset people by your presence. 
A: But, that’s their problem. They seem to be upset about a lot of things that are completely irrational. We don’t have an answer for that. If they want to hold a rally where I’m from, they’re welcome to do it. There might be a counter demonstration But, we’re not going to stop them from exercising their freedom of speech. 
According to Berkeley police, the organizers did not seek or obtain a permit for Saturday’s rally, but they “widely advertised the rally.” 
In all, some 20 people were arrested, and “more arrests will be pursued” when police review footage posted on social media. 
Charges include assault with a deadly weapon and other felony assaults. 
Police said 11 people suffered injuries and required medical treatment. Seven were taken to local hospitals. 
READ: Protest Turns Violent, Bloody As Pro-Trump, Anti-Trump Camps Clash In Berkeley

Think of it as a Slack for bots. A hangout where an ecommerce shopping bot could chat with hundreds of merchant bots to figure out where to get the cheapest iPhone 7, and even negotiate its price. Or a group of bots could play a game of poker in minutes to earn points or money for their owners. A brand could have multiple bots working together to respond to a customer query.
That’s Interbot , a fortnight-old channel where bots can talk to one another and collaborate.
Soon there will be over a million bots. Imagine what they can do if they collaborate. We’re getting used to encountering bots in messaging apps and business websites. And although they often suck at communicating with humans, they’re getting better at it with advances in natural language processing. But bot-to-bot communication is a new paradigm.
It’s the latest from the stable of Beerud Sheth, founder of Elance and Gupshup.
Beerud has been dabbling in bots for years, long before they became a buzzword. His company, Gupshup, based in Silicon Valley and Mumbai, provides tools and services to build bots and connects them to multiple channels.
Some time back, Beerud’s preoccupation shifted from building more and more advanced bots to getting bots to collaborate with one another to offer more powerful capabilities. This led to the creation of Interbot.
“Bots have massive ability to process information, and many bots are proving highly effective in multiple domains, from banking and ecommerce to customer engagement for enterprises,” Beerud tells Tech in Asia . “Soon there will be over a million bots. Imagine what they can do if they collaborate. We have created a channel to enable this and hope to make it a standard for interoperability between bots.”
Masterbots and minion bots GIF source: GIPHY
The artificially intelligent Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Facebook M (currently being rolled out) already have the capability to redirect queries to other bots to fetch requirements for anything from booking a ride to making a payment. In that sense, they act as masterbots with minion bots at their service. But this is restricted to bots that the Google, Amazon, or Facebook masterbot chooses to work with.
What Interbot has done is to create a channel where anybody can publish a bot in minutes – just like they would do on a channel like Facebook Messenger or Telegram to interact with humans. It will handle the messaging protocols between bots, as well as provide the context to help the bots figure which message relates to what.
Once published on Interbot, a bot can start chatting and collaborating with the other bots on the channel. Many more masterbots can emerge in this open space for different purposes, instead of just a handful from the tech giants.
Most developers don’t want to build different bots for Cortana, Einstein, Watson, and so on – they want to build it once and connect to everything. Every brand can have a masterbot to serve its customers. Large corporations, points out Beerud, would have bots in every division and location, but only one customer-facing bot. Now, an enterprise can put all its bots on Interbot and have them serving the brand’s masterbot.
Take Citibank, for example. Its superbot can chat with other bots from its mortgage, insurance, and currency divisions, to respond fast to customer queries. It can also chat with bots from third parties, like a payment app, to serve customers.
Currently, collaboration between apps happens through API (application programming interface) calls from one app to another. There can also be a bot-to-bot handoff, as in a user being redirected from Alexa to another bot. But “Interbot is a much more elegant framework to drive interoperability,” says Beerud. Unlike API calls, for example, bot-to-bot interaction will be bi-directional. API calls also require coding which can be time-consuming.
Chicken-and-egg question When I point out that the interoperability is restricted to bots published on the Interbot channel, Beerud admits that the fortnight-old channel needs to demonstrate its usefulness before bots congregate there in large numbers. It’s a chicken-and-egg question: the more bots there are, the more useful will be the hangout for bots, and vice versa.
Beerud wants to maintain “bot neutrality” by keeping the channel open to all, even if they compete with bots his own company helps to build. He’s hoping for network effects to kick in and make Interbot the open standard for interoperability. Right now, apart from bots not talking to one another directly, the space is fragmented.
The tech giants are in a race to offer their AI suites for developers of bots to leverage, like IBM Watson and Microsoft Bot Framework. They’re also building their masterbots, like Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Facebook M. But it’s hard for these rivals to come together to create an interoperable standard for the bots, even though Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM formed an AI alliance last year.
See: Startups react with hope and fear to AI alliance 
That’s where Interbot comes in. Its parent, Gupshup, already has partnerships with Google and others. Developers can use Gupshup to build voice-activated bots to work with Google Assistant, simplifying home automation with voice commands. Beerud is now working on getting the tech giants to partner with Interbot.
One idea is to have Interbot proxy bots to get on to a channel like Facebook Messenger and interact with all the bots there – 30,000 at last count. But social media apps are designed for human communication, with tight controls on messaging to prevent spamming – they’re not made for bots that will exchange millions of messages when they talk to their kind.
Doing away with pesky API calls The other possibility is for the tech giants’ masterbots to come to Interbot, which would enable bot developers to interact with all of them in one place instead of pushing a different bot on each channel. Developers would also be freed from API calls to the AI suites opened up by the biggies. “Most developers don’t want to build different bots for Cortana, Einstein, Watson, and so on – they want to build it once and connect to everything,” points out Beerud.
Still, why would any of the tech giants partner with Interbot, instead of building an interoperable platform themselves? The answer is simple: it would be very hard for a committee of rival giants to agree on who will set the standard. A neutral player, whose primary role is to enable connections, may be the glue they need for collaboration.
Besides, Interbot can potentially help them connect with a very large network of bots, expand the capabilities of their own bots, and get more traffic. So Beerud is hoping to forge some partnerships soon, which would have a multiplier effect on the power of Interbot.
See: Why Microsoft is asking startups to dance with it into the new year 
For now, he’s happy to see how developers and brands use the channel for their bots to interact. Perhaps my Uber bot will talk to the Starbucks bot so that my Kenyan coffee is ready when I reach Starbucks. And the Starbucks bot can talk to a movie bot to buy a ticket to a nearby show.
Developers can also combine bots to build more advanced bots faster. For example, a translation bot could be connected with a natural language processing bot and finally to a pizza ordering bot. The customer would then get a multilingual, intelligent pizza bot. Beerud likens it to Legos – joining a set of bots to create a powerful bot.
A bot built up like this could also upgrade itself simply by replacing one of the bots. For example, the translate bot in the pizza bot could be replaced by a new one that offers more languages.
Bot clutter 
One problem in the bot world is the clutter, with a plethora of junk bots that only waste a user’s time. Most of them are simply using menu-based algorithms which take care of a limited set of scenarios. Many use basic machine learning that can parse inputs and learn from them to improve responses, but they soon require human intervention.
See: An absolute beginner’s guide to machine learning, deep learning, and AI 
The best ones have deep learning with neural networks replicating how the human brain works. The AI suites opened up for developers by tech giants like IBM and Microsoft are helping them to build more intelligent bots. Beerud believes the rubbish bots will be cleared out over time, just as better search algorithms and certification services like Verisign sorted out some of the chaos in the early days of the world wide web.
For Interbot, he’s already talking to developers who can build review bots that can interact with other bots on the channel as well as users for a rating system. As of now, it has a registry where all bots on the channel will be listed and described. And it has documentation and services to enable messaging between the bots.
The devil is in the details Beerud’s company started working on this around nine months ago with a broad idea “to realize the true potential of the powerful capabilities of bots.” Practical ways of doing it became clearer in conversations with clients for whom Gupshup helps build and service bots.
Payroll and accounting software maker, Sage, for example has multiple bots and they use different tools from IBM Watson, Microsoft’s AI services, and more. Why can’t all these things be used in a plug-and-play way instead of the time-consuming process of writing code for different API calls? That was the question that kept coming up.
Thus the idea of a channel where bots can interact was born. Then the tech stack was built up to handle the connections and communication between bots on the channel. For example, Bot A needs to know the context of a message from Bot B – that it’s in reply to an earlier message from Bot A, for instance.
Some of our coworkers and managers may soon be bots. The next level is a semantic layer. For example, if an accounting bot sends an invoice in the European format, another bot using the American format may not understand it. “So we’ll have third party bots that enforce standards,” says Beerud.
There’s a long way to go for Interbot to mature. First it has to work cleanly and seamlessly. Then there will be new issues related to scale. Gupshup handles 4 billion messages a month for the bots it services.
“It’s hard when you dig into the details,” says Beerud. “That’s why we haven’t seen a deployment of inter-bot capability until now, even though people have been talking about it for some time.” Apart from Interbot, Radbots has announced it is building a “network” for bots to work together.
As bots continue to proliferate and become more enmeshed in our lives, AI researchers are exploring different ways of getting them to talk to one another and collaborate. One initiative at OpenAI aims to create a whole new language for bots instead of trying to mimic human language. That could be handy for the bots on Interbot to chat away with each other in bot lingo.

It’s not the first time the IIT Bombay alumnus with a master’s in computer science from MIT has come up with something new. After a stint on Wall Street as an investment banker, Beerud founded Elance in the late nineties when such platforms for outsourcing tech jobs were only subjects of speculation. The name Elance was borrowed from the title of a Harvard Business Review article titled, “The Dawn of the E-Lance Economy.”
He created Teamchat and Gupshup after exiting Elance in 2005. Tech-enabled communication and collaboration have been his preoccupations for nearly two decades. First it was between humans, and then between bots and humans. Now he takes that into the brave new world of bot-to-bot chat, and it seems like the right time for it.
“Some of our coworkers and managers may soon be bots,” Beerud points out.

Rather than conduct any enforcement actions, we took notes, we recorded observations, we tracked movements of these individuals for a short time after their purchases, but nothing more. Knowing all the while, just days after these purchases, the guns that we saw these individuals buy would begin turning up at crime scenes in the United States and Mexico, we still did nothing. ...I cannot begin to think of how the risk of letting guns fall into the hands of known criminals could possibly advance any legitimate law enforcement interest.

Obama’s over-the-top defense of Rice was surprising... She is ill-equipped to be the nation’s top diplomat. ...The Russian business daily Kommersant quoted an anonymous Russian foreign ministry official as saying that Rice, who quarreled with Russia over Syria , is “too ambitious and aggressive,” and her appointment would make it “more difficult for Moscow to work with Washington .” ...in her much-criticized TV performance, she was reciting talking points given to her by the intelligence agencies. But that’s the trouble. Rice stuck with her points even though they had been contradicted by the president of the Libyan National Assembly, who, on CBS’s Face the Nation just before Rice, said there was “no doubt” that the attack on Americans in Benghazi “was preplanned.” Rice rebutted the Libyan official, arguing — falsely, it turned out — that there was no evidence of such planning .

0,Jay Rayner,2017-04-16T10:16:47.000+03:00,[],,,english,0,2017-04-16T10:16:47.000+03:00,,"Box-E, Unit 10, Cargo 1, Wapping Wharf, Bristol BS1 6WP. Meal for two, including drinks and service: £85 
To understand Box-E in Bristol it’s worth knowing a little about the recent history of globalisation. From the late 90s onwards Middle America became the recipient of increasing volumes of cheap consumer goods, transported by sea from China to Long Beach, California, and then onwards by rail in shipping containers. They were the product of China’s economic boom and the comparative advantage of their cheaper workforce. At first it was too expensive to ship the containers back to China and so most were scrapped once they reached Chicago.

Soon the price of steel shot up as global demand increased, and scrapping them was no longer viable. They needed to go back but empty containers are unstable on ships. So now they were filled with old newspapers as ballast. Illinois was sending yesterday’s news to China. However, one of the outcomes of China’s huge economic growth was an expansion of the middle classes and, with that, of meat consumption. What the Chinese needed was lots of grain to feed to their cattle, which just happened to be something Illinois had in abundance. And so what had been a one-way trade became two-way: consumer goods from China in return for grain from America.

It was a simple exchange, which fuelled 21st-century globalisation and which, in turn, made the shipping container the icon of the new mercantile age. Sure, they had been around since shortly after the Second World War, but now the modular, easy-to-handle, extremely robust system came into its own. It’s unsurprising that enterprising types soon noticed that, with a tweak here or there, they could become buildings. And so it is that the driver of the most steely, hardcore form of global mass trade should also became the driver of small-scale independent business.
Bristol, like many other cities in the UK, is littered with the things. They are home to offices for small enterprises, to tiny retail units and, of course, start-up food ventures. Plumb in a sink, hook up some gas, build a plywood bar, buy some chairs from Ikea and away you go. Box-E, part of the relatively new Cargo 1 stack on Bristol’s Wapping Wharf, is unusual for the ambition of its offering. Containers may be sturdy, but they also smack of the temporary. Much of the time that translates into food that is equally casual.

Box-E, set up by Elliott Lidstone, former head chef of L’Ortolan and then of the Empress pub in Hackney, is sodden with a quiet, very Bristolian form of ambition. There are just 14 seats, at bare, spindly, wipe-clean tables, plus four seats at the counter. There is just Lidstone in the extremely open galley-style kitchen and his partner Tessa on the other side of it. Much of the interior is still lined with the blond plywood in which the unit came fitted out at the start. It’s all utilitarian. But their crusted sweet white bread, served warm, comes with a quenelle of whipped butter flavoured with seaweed. Suddenly it’s clear they are here to feed you and feed you well.
The setting may be quite different, but Box-E still has an awful lot in common with Wilsons , reviewed on this page three weeks ago. I’d go so far as to say there’s a defined Bristolian style. It’s rooted in the love of the small bistros of France, championed by the late Keith Floyd in his glorious pomp, who made his name here. The cooking is led by ingredients and seasonality and any other ethical markers that could make you feel better about yourself.
One friend who knows the Bristol restaurant sector well applauds it all, but identifies a certain earnestness, and I get their point. Witness: the handmade pottery plates at Box-E with a rough, gnarly glaze that makes a scratchy noise as the knife is dragged across them.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Winning harmonies’: hake with lentils. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt for the Observer 
What matters is the food on those plates, which is mostly very good. As with Wilsons, it’s a limited menu. There are just four starters and three mains. There’s a wedge of hispi cabbage, the rock god of the vegetable world right now, charred and smeared with an unembarrassed anchovy butter and dried seaweed for extra ooh and ah. Thick slabs of ox tongue, the crisped surface yielding to something altogether softer within, lie on cubes of Jersey Royal potatoes, the two introduced to each other courtesy of a dressing made with dollops of nose-tickling Dijon mustard. A duck egg, as rich as the top 10 of a Forbes magazine billionaires list, is baked with truffle oil and a bird’s nest of crisp, shredded leeks. All of these are £6 or £6.50.
The three mains cover the dietary needs of a Bristol dinner party: one meat, one fish, one vegetarian. The meat and fish dishes, both priced in the mid-teens, are variants on each other. Slices of onglet, a fleshy, butcher’s shop pink inside, dark and charred without, are layered with radicchio, wilted in the pan and dribbled with a powerful savoury jus. Below the meat are braised cannellini beans and then below that a salsa verde to give the whole thing power and meaning.
The same salsa verde provides the winning harmonies on a dish of hake. In such a small kitchen, this looks less like lack of imagination than common sense. The ingredients belong together on both plates. The fish is cooked precisely and is snowfield white, its surface glazed and golden and smeared with fennel, cooked down to a cheery caramelised jam, with a big anise hit. A heap of lightly stewed black lentils plays a supporting role.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘No place for pastry work’: panna cotta. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt for the Observer 
Dessert is low key compared to the punch and push of what has gone before, and extremely familiar from my meal at The Other Naughty Piglet . The crème caramel there is here a panna cotta. And there’s a chocolate mousse. The panna cotta is an exemplar of its kind; the mousse comes pelted with pomegranate seeds. But still it’s mildly disappointing. This is the downside to a one-person kitchen. Lidstone needs dessert to be something he can plate up, between taking care of stove-top business. There’s no place for pastry work.
It is, I think, a small price to pay for such a poised, bespoke operation. Against the scale of over-financed over-engineered big city openings, there’s something beguiling about Box-E. It’s the sense of people doing the thing they love their way, by finding an environment in which to make it work. That environment just happens to be a shipping container. 
Jay’s news bites Downstairs from Box-E, occupying three containers, is Pigsty, a porker-orientated café that grew out of the Jolly Hog range of sausages and bacon. At breakfast they serve a killer sandwich made with their impeccable black treacle-cured bacon. The lunch/dinner menu includes slow-roast pork shoulder croquettes, baps filled with pork belly and crackling, and pork burgers with pulled pork and baconaise. Other branches are on the cards ( pigstyuk.com ).
Want to know what you’re missing now it’s Easter? For a second year Unilever has unleashed its Marmite Easter egg. Not only is the chocolate in the shape of a Marmite jar, it’s flavoured with Marmite, too. Brand new is the Pot Noodle Bombay Bad Boy Easter egg: a Pot Noodle-branded mug with a chilli chocolate egg.
More Easter news: the Cornish Pasty Company has revealed that this year’s April Fools gag – the announcement of pasties in the shape of Easter Eggs – was so positively received that next year they’re doing it for real. And that’s no joke. Or yolk. I’m so sorry ( thecornishbakery.com ). Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1

GROND: The Raven High 
by Yuri Hamaganov 
Genre: YA Scifi 
Release Date: April 2017 
Summary: 
In the year 2086, Earth is exhausted. The seas have been emptied, the bedrock and soil stripped of their resources, and the superheated atmosphere churns with terrible storms. Those who can afford to do so live in the limbo of virtual reality, and the billions who suffer in poverty have no work, no clean water, and no security from the chaos.
The only hope for those trapped on a dying Earth are the Changed—the seven bioengineered post-humans who work in their separate manufacturing facilities orbiting high above the planet. Raised from birth for their work and fully matured at ten years old, their genius provides the nanomaterials that have begun to cleanse Earth of the pollutants that have wiped out almost the entire ecosphere.
But for Olga Voronov, youngest of the Changed, the isolation and endless toil are not the greatest of her challenges. Down on Earth there are those who resent and fear her talents—and would prefer that humanity not be given the second chance that only she could make possible …

Excerpt: CHAPTER SIX: CHANGED 
 
…Paris. December. But this was not the city whose streets Olga loved to prowl on a motorcycle in her early childhood.
Olga and Arina Rodionovna slowly walked along the central streets. The simulator reproduced the thick snowfall and cold wind with exceptional precision. Their fashionable leather boots squished over the slush as they walked down trash-filled sidewalks and past once-fashionable shops whose windows were covered with steel shields and twined with concertina wire. There were no trees left—they had long since been cut down for firewood. Only one out of every ten street lamps operated since electricity was so costly. Hydrogen powered vehicles hummed down the street. A large column of smoke rose into the sky from a few blocks away. Shots were heard as rioters and the army traded gunfire. A huge line of people stood in front of a government office. Judging by their looks, they had spent many hours in the cold.
“Nowadays you will see a similar picture in all the major cities,” Arina said. “The situation here is still rather calm. The army still has control of the city center, though they steer clear of the outskirts if they can help it.”
“Are all those people unemployed?”
“Yes, and they are seeking food rations. Most of them have never had a permanent occupation. And never will.”
Olga shrugged. It wasn’t her problem.
There was too little work left for Earth’s huge population. Hardly ten percent of them were employed. The space industry with its high efficiency had ruthlessly destroyed most enterprises on Earth. The farming industry had also changed drastically over the pat fifty years, with fully automatic facilities needing almost no personnel.
Finally, there were Olga and other representatives of the Changed from her generation. The symbiosis of the artificial intellect and nanomachines has given them virtually unlimited capabilities. And so the billions of ordinary people had become useless for anything except standing in lines for free rations.
Olga had never felt sorry about that, taking this state of things as a matter of course. Since her early childhood she understood that you can’t stand in the way of progress or progress will crush you. These people couldn’t compete with her, and so in compliance with the omnipotent laws of evolution, they were doomed to defeat and squalor. The sole thing that worried Olga was that sooner or later she too could be replaced. This option was not unlikely either.
“We observe the classical vicious circle,” Arina said. “No work, no money. No money, no trade. No trade, no work. Nowadays to live on Earth, one must be either very rich or very poor. All others have gone to the orbit.”
The sirens howled out their warnings of the commencement of the curfew and the closure of borders between the districts. Olga shuddered as a gust of cold wind hurled wet snow into her face. Even as the rest of the world baked, Europe had frozen with the cessation of Gulf Stream current.
“Well, Raven, have you decided not to return to Earth when your contract expires?”
Olga stopped. Her glance took in the dark streets, barred windows, dismal figures.
“Here? I don’t think so … But where shall I go?”
About the Author Yuri Hamaganov lives in Moscow. He created the eight-volume GROND series as a present for himself when he was twelve years old. This was the story he had always dreamed of exploring, and when he realized that nobody had written it for him, he set out to do it himself.

Her new novel, LaRose , her 15th, is the third part of a loose trilogy, along with The Plague of Doves and The Round House , all set around a Native American reservation in North Dakota and featuring some of the same characters.
It starts with the zing of a bullet as Landreaux, an Ojibwe man out stalking a deer, accidentally kills his neighbour’s young son. In accordance with tribal ways of administering justice he realises he must give the bereaved parents his own five-year-old son, LaRose. The fallout, for the boy, his family and the people around him, gives shape to her story.
LaRose ’s narrative is only one thread among many. Erdrich’s novel is a large-canvas portrait of a community and this is where she excels, mapping out relationships, the bonds between people, the sense of shared experience, shared knowledge.
Erdrich is part Ojibwe herself and there are mythic elements at play here. Certain lines are filmier in this world – the line between the body and beyond, the sense of being tethered to the earth. But she blends this with a strong realist streak. There is a lot of poverty, alcohol and substance abuse, and damage in this community too. This is encapsulated in Romeo, the most vividly imagined of the characters, his leg and arm crushed when he was a child, a half man, living a half life, filching other people’s prescription drugs.
Erdrich is also great at conveying the fierceness of children, their grasp of the world and their place in it. The dead boy’s sister Maggie ends up keeping her disconsolate mother alive, with LaRose as her ally.
There’s something approaching a plainness to Erdrich’s style but she has a way of pinning things down in words. She hops nimbly between times and between characters, allowing us to see this community and the people in it through many eyes. There are a few baggy sections – it’s not as focused as The Round House , it meanders more – but it is still a book of beauty, a hymn to people’s ability to forgive.

In my experience (admittedly, I've never used Airbnb in Bulgaria), that is most definitely not the case. If you are nervous about that, filter your search to look only for Superhosts (this can be done via the website, but not the app, for some reason)--you can't maintain your Superhost status if you cancel even one reservation. Airbnb automatically puts a feedback when the hosts cancel, so when we were looking at a couple of locations we were seeing some hosts that had 5+ cancellations and then a couple of reviews in between.

Gifted is a sweet, sugary confection of a movie. It’s tooth-decaying goodness in cinema form. This isn’t a bad thing. In fact, it is the kind of movie we need right now. It’s not heavy Oscar bait, it’s not a shocking horror movie, it’s not ripped from the headlines. It’s just syrupy and pure and wholly enjoyable. The movie stars Chris Evans as Frank, as he battles over Mary’s (a plucky McKenna Grace) parental rights against his mother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan). Rounding out the cast is the ever adorable Jenny Slate as Mary’s teacher, Bonnie, and the formidable Octavia Spencer as Mary and Frank’s champion. Though the movie takes place in and out of the one of the worst places in the world, a family law courthouse, it abounds with cleverness and many chuckle worthy moments. This movie was directed by the man that brought us the delightful 500 Days of Summer, Marc Webb. 
Gifted is not all sunshine and rainbows. It explores some deep, dark family themes such as unattainable parental expectations, parental favoritism, and putting adult needs over the needs of an innocent child. The movie also touches on the hardest part of being a parent/guardian – stepping on Legos while barefoot. I am glad someone finally brought up this cold, hard fact of life. 
I could whole heartedly recommend this to just about everyone. It is rated PG-13 for perhaps some mild language (the big bad word is dropped once) and some sexual content. Considering that the movie goers I saw it with applauded at the end should tell you something. You will leave the theater glad you went. 
Frank Adler (Chris Evans) is a single man raising a child prodigy – his spirited young niece Mary (Mckenna Grace) – in a coastal town in Florida. Frank’s plans for a normal school life for Mary are foiled when the seven-year-old’s mathematical abilities come to the attention of Frank’s formidable mother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan) whose plans for her granddaughter threaten to separate Frank and Mary. Octavia Spencer plays Roberta, Frank and Mary’s landlady and best friend. Jenny Slate is Mary’s teacher, Bonnie, a young woman whose concern for her student develops into a connection with her uncle as well.

There are many different Golf instruction videos on the market. You can find videos that cover every aspect of the game, from curing a slice to putting. The problem is few can say their golf game improved because of what they learned on a video. Here are a number of golf tips to help you get the most from a Golfing Instructions Orlando FL video.

The Simple Golf Swing is the maiden skill to be taught of all the golf instructions and it is quite a simple lesson. The golf swing is the most vital trick and technique in the game. By being able to master the swing, you will be able to enjoy the sport since the sport now becomes a part of you and the swing now comes naturally even without giving much thought to what you are doing. When you learn the method, you are able make further and more straight shot and by being able to make those you are assured to win majority of the games of golf that are in your playing schedule.

Golf Scoring-The game consists of a group of golfers playing a golf round and counting each of their strokes to hit the ball from the tee box to the hole of the putting surface. A round typically consists of 18 holes with a typical target score (par) of 72 total shots across the 18 holes. The golfer with the lowest score wins the game. The game is governed by a fairly strict set of rules that have been honored by golfers for centuries. A typical golf course ranges from 6,500 to 7,200 yards in length.

These start with the lower parts of your body, that is, your hips and legs. The legs are important during a golf swing. They help you maintain your balance during a swing. Without a good balance, you are likely to topple and fall during the swing. Weight is channeled from the rear to front of the body with the thighs, hips and knees moving to the front.

""Irons"" are typically golf clubs used for the short to mid-range phase of the golf game (typically 200 YARDS and in to the hole) and can include the 3 through 6 iron for mid-range shots (150 to 200 yards), 7 through 9 iron for shorter iron shots (110 to 150 yards) and ""wedges"" for short game shots (110 yards and in toward the hole). ""Woods"" are used for the distance phase of the game include the driver (220+ yards) and 3 to 5-woods (170 yards+)

Third, develop a good exercise routine to condition your body and muscles. You want to improve your golf game, not spend time exercising. What this helps you with is to work on a routine that focuses on the muscles most used in the golf swing.

Learn the game of golf involves the following typical approach that the beginner golfer takes to learn the game. Reviews a book or DVD that explains instruction and game basics in detail, take beginner golf instruction from a PGA certified professional instructor. Most PGA professionals can provide golf equipment for the lesson which the beginner golfer should use until he or she learns enough about the golf game to purchase equipment tailored to physical traits and swing.

One way of doing this is to work with the proper exercise program you can tone and strengthen your body. Apply these 3 golf tips to get the most from a golf instruction video and watch your game change... For the better

Jeff Joireman, associate professor of marketing at WSU’s Carson College of Business, has been appointed co-editor-in-chief of the Journal of Environmental Psychology – along with professor Florian Kaiser of Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg, Germany. 
The Journal of Environmental Psychology is the leading international journal in environmental psychology. The journal publishes articles focusing on the scientific study of the transactions and interrelationships between people and their physical surroundings (including built and natural environments, the use and abuse of nature and natural resources, and sustainability-related behavior). 
Prior to his appointment, Joireman served on the editorial review board of JEP for many years, and last year served as one of two associate editors for the journal. 
He and Paul Van Lange, VU University Amsterdam, co-authored the book “ How to Publish High-Quality Research .” He has published over 55 articles, many in leading journals.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Shura … shoegazey dream-pop Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Coachella
If Madonna was in a shoegaze band, it would sound a bit like Shura . Armed with sequencer and synth, denim jacket, and seapunk green streaks, the 25-year-old Aleksandra Denton connected with her impressive midday crowd by bashing through acclaimed debut album Nothing’s Real with equal parts sugar and grit.
With drums and guitar for support, Denton flitted through myriad voices of dream-pop, new wave, even a touch of 90s r’n’b, but she closed the set bashing her sequencer with closed fists and right hooks with real triumphant rock’n’roll vigor. It’s rare you see any aggression on stage nowadays, but Smith was thrashing around like a particularly ornery Eddie Vedder at the finale.

Mitski – Gobi
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mitski delivered reflections on modern American teenhood. Photograph: Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images
For the early risers Mitski’s blend of Morrissey-style self reflection and pop punk was a soothing start to a day when many hangovers were being nursed. Mitski Miyawaki’s fragile songs – which lyrically are somewhere between the Smiths and St Vincent, while musically owe a debt to Weezer and Teenage Fanclub – might not sound like aural electrolytes but despite the heavy content it’s her subtle delivery that makes them soothing. Backed by just a drummer and guitarist, she runs through songs from her two most recent critically lauded albums , including Francis Forever and Happy that provide a downcast look at the state of American teenhood.
For the quiet crowd that saw more people sitting down than standing, it was a gentle, if slightly sombre start to the day that picked up speed only with the pop punk of Townie. The screeching guitar solo of that song was in stark contrast to some of her slower numbers but on the second day of a grueling desert festival it was no bad thing.

Downtown Boys – Sonora
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Victoria Ruiz of Downtown Boys. Photograph: Matt Cowan/Getty Images for Coachella
There was a distinctly mellow vibe to yesterday’s proceedings, the calm before the sandstorm that was to follow. An early afternoon spot for a band that describe themselves as a “bi bilingual political dance sax punk party” acted as an early sign that Saturday was heading in a very different direction.
Playing to just a handful of festival-goers, the Downtown Boys were at least perfectly suited to their stage, the brand new Sonora tent that felt like a grimy club on the lower east side of Manhattan. Their frenetic set allowed for some enthused moshing at the front but it remained difficult to distinguish each song from the next and while lead singer Victoria Ruiz tried to inject political sentiment to her riffing between songs, it was a mixed bag of buzzwords and little else. As she dedicated a later song to those who just want to say no to “a mom who doesn’t understand them”, the lone cheer suggested that even the millennials on site were a bit too old for this rather empty brand of musical anger.

Car Seat Headrest – Mojave Will Toledo’s turquoise suit was the most entertaining part of Car Seat Headrest’s languid daytime strum-along in the Mojave. Hawking Sonic Youth and The Silver Jews in equal amount, the set was hackneyed, backwards-looking and didn’t feel very much like “ the future of US rock ” as some have suggested.
With all that’s going on in the world right now, bedroom indie rock, a genre defined by mopey dudes lamenting the minutiae of their love lives and hamming the same three chords for decades, has very little to offer. But then again, maybe that’s the appeal? Rock’n’roll may never truly die, but if it lives on for now in limp facsimiles like Car Seat Headrest, it’ll be a very long road to reincarnation.

Thundercat – Mojave
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Drunk-en master … Thundercat. Photograph: Anthony Pidgeon/Redferns
A packed-out Mojave crowd impatiently awaited the arrival of Thundercat , whose new album Drunk has brought the multi-genre talent more critical and commercial success than he’s experienced before. His atmospheric funk proved to be easily digestible sunset listening although he couldn’t resist extending the brief running time of his new tracks (the majority of which are under three minutes), each drifting into jazzy freestyling longer then needed.
Given the starry lineup of Drunk (and his impressive resumé), there was also a lingering sense of anticipation over who might join him on stage (frequent collaborator Kendrick Lamar is tomorrow’s headliner after all). But, in a joyfully unexpected move, he brought on Michael McDonald to the stage, much to the confusion of a twentysomething crowd largely unaware of his work. The pair performed album track Show Me the Way before McDonald, assisted by Thundercat, stormed through a crowd-pleasing rendition of What A Fool Believes, its hook remaining as effective as ever. It was a perfect moment in a set that contained slick highs and a bit too much instrumental overindulgence.

Four Tet/Daphni/Floating Points – Yuma
Facebook Twitter Pinterest A busy man … Floating Points aka Sam Shepherd. Photograph: Dan Medhurst
Four Tet , Daphni , and Floating Points are like the three wise men of indie-informed electronic music. Four Tet AKA Kieran Hebden could headline anywhere from Low End Theory in LA to Fabric in London, Daphni AKA Dan Snaith has already conquered the indie world with his adored Caribou moniker, and Floating Points AKA Sam Shepherd was fresh from a set in the Mojave Tent playing analog synth in the jazzy, jammy post-rock trio that forms the live iteration of his act. Suffice to say, their modus operandi favors chinstroking more than fistpumping.
When these three get together, there’s a tendency towards disco. They used the genre as a launchpad to explore the fringes of beat-driven music, from soul to minimal techno, for almost four hours – a marathon session by Coachella standards. Their intellectual bent did not obscure from the euphoria of their selections, and the Yuma tent was brimming with positive energy and questionable dance moves –two requirements for any good party.

Roísín Murphy – Gobi In a noticeably quiet tent, Roísín Murphy appeared on stage dressed in one of many costumes that would play a huge part in her late afternoon set. Competing against local favourite Thundercat, who was in the adjacent tent, meant there was an intimate feel to a performance that was anything but low-key. Last year her album Take Her Up to Monto was deemed “ still too strange for the bigtime ” and her tendency toward the experimental, rather than the mainstream was on display in the desert.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Roísín Murphy … experimental excellence. Photograph: Rich Fury/Getty Images for Coachella
From set opener Thoughts Wasted, the crowd were given a set that felt more like experimental theatre at times than the pop starlet EMI thought they had signed 10 years ago. A slew of onstage props and costumes were casually draped over synths and mic stands, with Murphy picking and choosing at will as if in a thrift store stocked exclusively with paraphernalia from the most out-there of theatre companies.
Nods to her earlier more poppy phase featured, such as Tell Everybody during which she picked up a bag that came in the shape of a bear, unzipped it and proceeded to pull about 25ft of red ribbon from inside it. Those choices and her set which included newer more avant garde material such as Gone Fishing, which was inspired by the classic voguing documentary Paris Is Burning, made for a show that was at times more challenging than accessible to even a clearly committed crowd. For Murphy, clearly performance comes before anything else, and when the spell was broken by a roadie who adjusted a bell she was playing during the low-slung new track Whatever, the annoyance was clear to see .
The last portion of the set saw a 4/4 beat finally feature with House of Glass raising the tempo and giving a crowd which was clearly champing at the bit for something to dance to, a chance to do just that. But rather than running through songs from Overpowered, the set finished with a eight-minute jam of Exploitation with Murphy swapping outfits, finally finished up with an archery target mask. It was a slightly manic end to a set that was possibly the most experimental performance Coachella will see.

Future – Main Stage
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fake love? Drake and Future. Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for Coachella
Atlanta trap iconoclast Future drew a crowd almost as big as Radiohead’s the night before at the main stage. Heavy on visual and sartorial style, Future’s oversized persona fit the massive setting, even if his music failed to match that stature . Future’s tunes sat somewhere between softball hip-hop and radio-appropriate pop hooks. His overtures towards the abstract flatter to deceive any semblance of depth.
Future brought out fellow Atlanta rappers Migos for a shouty rendition of their Donald Glover-endorsed hit Bad and Bougie, with beatmaker Zaytoven also in the mix. But that was not the extent of the surprises. When Drake appeared to perform their collaboration Jumpman, a cacophony of squeals erupted from the audience and bodies rushed towards the stage from all sides. Drake took the lead for three tracks – including ubiquitous radio hit Fake Love – and led the crowd in a sporting round of sing-along of the track before leaving the stage to Future, who delivered one more song as the crowd began to leave after Drake departed.

Warpaint – Gobi
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Disaffected, if proficient … Warpaint. Photograph: Tabatha Fireman/Redferns
As a band who often feel uncomfortable on a big stage (they were particularly ill-suited as a headliner for 2014’s Field Day in London), Warpaint were wisely picked for the more intimate Gobi tent, which when darkness sets in, feels almost like a four-walled gig venue. They were also accompanied by a compellingly flashy stage yet despite the efforts, there’s still something unavoidably flat about their presence when live.
It certainly can’t be traced back to their instrumental skills with all four members providing a technically accomplished performance. But while the choice of stage might have forced a level of intimacy, there’s still a spark missing. It doesn’t help that so many of their songs, intriguing individual elements aside, are incredibly difficult to remember once they’re over. It resulted in a set that felt lost within a festival packed with more distinctive acts, working hard to gain new fans. Warpaint’s disaffected, if proficient, shtick is for their hardcore following only.

Bon Iver – Main Stage On Friday, the xx struggled to make the difficult second-from-top spot their own, but on Saturday Bon Iver managed to put together a complex, layered set that managed to entertain while staying true to his latest album, 22, a Million . That record, with its focus on big production, numerology and lavish use of auto-tune divided fans, but as a big stage production its lofty ambition was realised. With a full horn section and backing band with huge screens plastered in visuals, numbers and hieroglyphs, this version of Bon Iver was very different from the one who emerged with delicate songs about heartbreak from a cabin in the woods back in 2008.
Here tracks like 715 – CR??KS with its stuttering composition and moments of pained auto-tune were received with shouts of appreciation. Bon Iver AKA Justin Vernon looked more like a record store employee with his ever-present headphones and T-shirt sporting the name of DJ collective Discwoman. But despite the dressed-down attire, songs like 29 #Strafford APTS and 33 “GOD”, felt huge with Vernon’s well-honed live set that wasn’t hampered by any of the technical difficulties Radiohead suffered.

The most perplexing question about Kim Jong-un was never addressed in the report of the festivities Saturday celebrating his own “greatness” and that of his grandfather and father who preceded him in the brutal family business of dictatorship. That question is a multifaceted one, primarily focused on how a dictator whose hair looks like somebody pinched one off on his head is able to determine when he’s got it just right. How does he know when it looks good? When is the flip angle perfect, the amount of curl just right? What happens to people who call him Sh*thead? 
Failing to address that important issue, the rest of the report on festivities was of the customary communist template that we’ve seen countless times before. Military might was front and center as the procession passed in front of the reviewing stand of officials. 
The celebration took place in Kim Il-sung Square, in the center of the North Korean capitol city, Pyongyang, marking the 105th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung. The reporter points to the seated Kim Jong-un watching all that is unfolding before him. Talk about pressure, those human statues know if they make one wrong move their dear leader will have them put down. It’s a bad time for their allergies to be acting up. 
Kim leans over the railing to wave to the adoring masses below and feed his little, reality-challenged porkchop ego with assurances that he is in fact as great as all of those participation trophies, awards and medals he’s received throughout his life have said he is. 
The official event proved to the world that North Korea is not the primitive, bland and hopeless society we’ve been led to believe here in the West. They do have balloons, as we learned from watching the aerial display. They also have pink and red flowers or colored toilet paper on a stick – it’s tough to tell which. They’re probably flowers, it’s unlikely they’ve progressed to the point of having toilet paper, or of mastering its use. The balloons are surely imported too. Some will be brought over to Kim’s playroom when all of this is over. 
The centerpiece of the function, the North Korean missiles, are all theirs. Grandpa’s meaningless birthday, the waving to the crowds, the marchers, all of that is sideshow. The missiles were what they wanted us to see, and they brought the attention of the entire world through their provocations, to view them. We were also treated to the implied and overt threats. 
This guy really knows how to throw a party.

Take a survey to check what people would say and I bet it’s going to be “Temples” and why not? Madurai is known for its marvellous sculptures carved very intricately but besides this, there are few other things that make Madurai the most visited place in Tamil Nadu; the Dravidian art and culture that has become the hub of the entire southern India, the bustling city whose chatter never ends, the famous bull-taming sport called “Jallikattu”, the sensational greenery and the Arabian or Indian Jasmine Slide 3 All these are by-products of this famous city. With such a flawless and spectacular creation, your visit to this place should never be missed and that too, it being just 462 km from Chennai. If you ever plan to visit, ensure that you make up to these five places; Slide 4 Sree Meenakshi Amman Temple:Madurai city is built around this temple. The city’s structure is shaped in the form of a lotus with the temple in the center and streets in a concentric manner. Slide 5 The city’s structure is shaped in the form of a lotus with the temple in the center and streets in a concentric manner Constructed by the Pandya King Kulasekara Pandian, the temple is dedicated to Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva. The extensive premises with 1000 pillars inside the temple is an example of architectural brilliance thus making this conception as one of the ideal specimens of the Dravidian architecture. Slide 6 Thirupparankundram Murugan Temple?:this temple is considered to be one of the six abodes of Lord Murugan where he slew the evil Surapadman and married Deivayanai. It is built in rock-cut architecture and is believed to have been constructed by the Pandyas during the 6th century. Slide 7 Gandhi Museum?: the building that houses the museum was constructed by Queen Rani in the year 1670 AD but was later transformed to Gandhi’s memorial place after his assassination in the year 1959. There is a library in there that holds a vast collection of India’s culture and books written by Gandhi. Also, there is an exhibition section that includes the 265 illustrations of our freedom struggle. Slide 8 Samanar Hills?: ?also called as Samanar Malai is hill- rock architecture located in Keelakuyilkudi village some 15 km from Madurai city. The hills have caves where Jain monks were believed to have lived. With numerous stone beds and sculptures, this place is worth sight-seeing. Slide 9 Gorippalayam Mosque?: Gorippalayam comes from the Persian word “gor” meaning “grave”. Built in the 13th century, it is one of the largest mosques in Madurai housing the tombs of two great rulers; Sulthan Alauddin Badusha and Sulthan Shamsuddin Badusha. Its dome is 70 feet in diameter and 20 feet in height and is made of a single black stone which was brought from the Azhaga Hills.

Rise of the Branded 
Scott Keen 
(Scar of the Downers, #2)
Publication date: November 22nd 2016
Genres: Fantasy, Young Adult
Pursued into the wild by the soldiers of Ungstah, former slave Crik and the other freed Downers encounter the magical and terrifying nature of their world. They face spectral Shepherds, man-eating Rukmush, and the ancient giants of the earth. When two of their group are captured, Crik is distraught and powerless. 
Meanwhile back in the city, Durgan, former Captain of the King’s Guard who allowed Crik and his friends to escape from Ungstah, is now a Downer, one of the Branded. Amid the murmurings of an uprising among the Branded, Durgan just wants to be left alone to search for his missing son. But in the process, he discovers how dark the powers of Sulfus the king truly are. Durgan must take a stand in the coming war between the Branded and the powerful armies of Sulfus.
To kill any hope of escape for the city’s Branded, the army comes after Crik and his friends to make an example of them. The answers for Durgan, Crik and freedom for all Downers lie hidden in the dark recesses of the Northern Reaches, in the treacherous places Crik and his companions are about to enter.

EXCERPT:
They reached the bottom of the stairs and plunged through an open door into a dust-filled atrium. A gray sunlight flowed into the shattered windows, highlighting the smoke from the Pit that found its way in, but was unable to find its way out. Brakken pushed open the outer doors and glimpsed into a courtyard. A few Downers were scattered about. One was sitting in the corner wrapped in a porous blanket, while a few others were standing and whispering in a noonday shadow. Several more unsavory looking Downers were watching them from a balcony.
“Where are we?” asked Durgan.
“You’ll see,” said Brakken.
One behind the other, with Brakken in front, they walked through the courtyard, opened up a black walnut door, and bounded up several flights of stairs until they came to yet another door. Brakken knocked and waited. Durgan surveyed the area and knew they were not in the part of the Waste he would feel comfortable visiting without Brakken. A minute passed and Brakken knocked again. This time it opened, and standing before Durgan was a young man who looked to be about the age of seventeen. He was short, stocky, with dark hair.
“Who’s this?” asked the young man.
“I’d rather not tell you standing out here,” said Brakken.
The young man eyed Durgan up and down, and then stepped out of the way to allow them to enter. Before the young man could ask his question again, Brakken smiled and said, “This, Hegg, is Durgan, captain of the city’s watch.”
Hegg smiled at Brakken, and then glanced at Durgan. Suddenly, however, he stumbled back, his young eyes widening in recognition. “I know you!” he cried out, pointing his finger at Durgan and tripping over his own feet. “You are the captain of the city’s watch. What’d you do, Brakken? You led him right to us!”
“Oh, shut-up!” Brakken smiled, clearly enjoying the reaction. “What I meant to say is that he used to be the captain of the city’s watch. Now!” Brakken lifted up Durgan’s sleeve. “He’s a Downer. And he’s going to help us.”
“Help you?” cried Durgan. “Help you do what?”
Brakken ignored the question. “Get Koval.”
Hegg glared at Durgan out of the corner of his eye before he left, leaving Durgan and Brakken alone.
“What are you talking about?” hissed Durgan. “What is all of this? Who’s that boy? Who’s Koval?”
“Just be patient,” smiled Brakken. “I’ll let you know in a minute.”
Grabbing Brakken by the shirt, Durgan wrenched him close, but the smile never left the young man’s freckled face. “Tell me now or I’m out of here. My wife is alone in your house, defenseless. I don’t have time for these games.”
Someone behind Durgan coughed, and when he spun around, he spotted Hegg standing next to another young man. Durgan released Brakken and scowled at them.
“Who are you?” he snarled.
Brakken spread his arms wide open and grinned. “We, Durgan, are the Branded. You met Hegg. The other one is Koval. We are the beginning of your army.”

Tren E is short for Trenbolone Enanthate, which is trenbolone’s long-releasing concoction.  It’ll peak within just some few days, but can take almost two weeks before it’s fully absorbed by the body. It has been regarded as an extremely powerful anabolic that’s even more powerful than testosterone . 
                       
                                       

             

Tren E Benefits 
Tren e is good for strength boosting and increasing your lean muscle mass.  What's more, it can’t change itself into estrogen. 

Trenbolone enanthate can help speed up your metabolism. 

Speeding up your metabolism can greatly aid if you also want to make the fat burning process quicker. As a bodybuilder or athlete, it is of course not good if you have a large amount of fat deposits in your body. The fat deposits can destroy your good body shape.So it will be really good for you if you can lose fats while increasing your muscle mass. Fortunately, the trenbolone enanthate can help you in achieving these two goals. 

Trenbolone enanthate can revitalize your body’s protein synthesis and increase the growth of your muscular tissues. 
Even the use of androgenic hormone or testosterone can’t revitalize your body’s protein systhesis. The trenbolone enanthate is the most effective steroid that can quickly revitalize the protein synthesis in your body while increasing the amount of your muscles tissues. The increase of muscle tissues can be done through the restorative qualities of trenbolone enanthate. 
                        

Tren e 200mg*10ml  click for price                           


Tren E Dosages 
It is advisable that you take only 75 to 100mg of Trenbolone every other day for 6 to 8 weeks.  Intermediate users may increase their dose.  A maximum dosage of 500mg of Testosterone Enanthate per week for 1 to 12 weeks. 

Tren E Stack 

It’s highly recommended however that testosterone be part of the stack since Tren, in any form, would greatly suppress natural production of testosterone. Most individuals find it useful supplementing with the T-3 hormone as levels will generally fall with the presence of Tren. 

In the off-season, most find a stack of testosterone and Tren to be amazingly beneficial, and it’s also possible to add Anadrol or Dianabol . Others find using Nandrolone in an overlapping manner with their Tren to be much beneficial. However, such use is usually only advised for advanced long-term cycles. In the cutting phase, testosterone and Tren can again prove quite beneficial. 

In addition, you should bear in mind that responsible use of Tren E is demandingly important. As such, an effective Post Cycle Therapy plan should occur, following the completion of the cycle. A Good PCT plan stimulates natural production of testosterone and drastically reduces the total recovery time. 

In case your cycle ends with the steroid in play, the PCT won’t want to begin till at least two weeks pass since the last injection.

Tren E or Tren A 
The primary difference between Trenbolone Acetate and Trenbolone enanthate is esters. While Tren E, featured by comparatively less esters, peaks at a slow pace and leaves the system slowly, Tren A with more esters peaks faster and leaves the system faster.  Moreover, Tren A is better when it comes to maintaining stable blood levels, especially when athletes want to gain muscle mass and strength when following a dieting regimen. Furthermore, the human body finds it simpler to absorb a higher percentage of milligrams when injected with the acetate form rather than in the enanthate form. 

A big majority of athletes and bodybuilders, especially those into elite sports and professional bodybuilding, prefer Trenbolone acetate over Trenbolone enanthate. This is because the enanthate version of Trenbolone doesn't result in as much hardening of muscles as experienced with the acetate version. While the acetate version is known to promote cutting, the enanthate version is used for adding muscle size. Beginners to the world of anabolic compounds should opt for Tren A instead of Tren E as Tren acetate gets out of the system quickly. However, the enanthate version of Tren is rarely associated with night sweats, insomnia, and over-aggression and allows athletes to reap the optimum benefits of the potent steroids.  Tren E is less likely to result in the dreaded Tren cough and involves less pinning but the use of this steroid involves more of patience as results can take time. 


Based on above, everyone can choose tren e or tren a based on personal actual demand.

After two rough years, will Oklahoma higher ed budget fare better this year? Published: April 16, 2017 12:00 AM CDT Updated: April 16, 2017 12:00 AM CDT 0 shares facebook twitter email comments Advertisement 
THE Legislature last year cut the state's higher education budget by 16 percent, a clear message that lawmakers felt higher ed could absorb the blow easier than other core government agencies. Will they send a different message this year? 
Chancellor Glen Johnson hopes so, and even says he has “reasonable” optimism that higher ed's budget might even stay flat. That may be overly optimistic in a year when the state has an $878 million budget hole to fill, but it's encouraging that Johnson says the tone of his conversations with legislators has improved over last year. 
At that time, while the state faced a budget deficit exceeding $1 billion, a campaign was underway that would ask voters to approve a 1-cent increase in the state sales tax. The primary pitch was that it would fund pay raises for K-12 teachers, but higher education also stood to get a large slice of the annual revenue. That effort irked some lawmakers. 
Voters in November overwhelmingly rejected the initiative, thus turning the funding of teacher pay raises into a front-burner issue for this session. But lawmakers should keep higher ed's needs and challenges in mind as they craft this year's budget. 
The $157 million cut from higher education for this fiscal year followed a cut of $116 million the year before. Higher ed's appropriation of $810 million for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, is within a few million dollars of what it received from the Legislature for fiscal 2001. 
Among other things, this year's cuts resulted in the elimination of some academic and athletic programs, reduced funding for financial aid programs such as the concurrent enrollment efforts that involve roughly 10,000 high school students, and meant fewer tutoring and counseling services. They also have produced changes such as schools finding ways to share faculty — something Johnson says has been positive and wouldn't have been considered a decade ago. 
Johnson says he expects suggestions for further streamlining and innovation could result from a review of higher ed to be conducted this year by a special task force. It's certainly fair to ask whether the system needs as many branch campuses as it has today, or whether online opportunities should expand at a faster rate, to name just two examples. 
However, Johnson also makes a good point when he notes a Georgetown University study showing that two-thirds of all jobs created in Oklahoma by 2020 will require some college, a long-term certificate or a college degree. Thirty-seven percent of all jobs created in the state by then will require at least an associate's degree. Higher education will need to produce those job applicants. 
The number of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) degrees awarded by state colleges and universities has grown by 32 percent in the past five years. Oklahoma needs for that percentage to continue to increase. It also needs more college graduates, period — 24.6 percent of our adult population has a bachelor's degree or more, compared with 30.6 percent nationally. 
A robust higher education system is important to any state that wants to grow and prosper. Lawmakers should remember that as the FY '18 budget takes shape. You might also be interested in...

Well, you are not alone! Although there are a lot, A LOT, of trolls sharing and believing those lies and alternative facts, there is still hope for there are still us who wants to fight for the truth.
So what is really a fake news? 
Fake news are articles published by someone over the internet that contains false information about something for the purpose of playing on gullible people who do not check sources and will just pass the news on as if it were really true. I know you have seen a lot, scanning your news feed on Facebook. You may even see your own friends sharing these.
Now, does it really affect us? 
The answer is yes! Definitely, a yes. In the Philippine setting alone, fake news are rampant. Any information that they found online supporting their own ideology, they would consider as true and even spread it to others without checking the facts. This serves as a proof that the spread of misinformation has not only been overlooked but also celebrated.
The rise of fake news in the country has grown into a larger scale on the 2016 National Elections.
According to Tony Katigbak of The Philippine Star,
“With the rise of two main camps with conflicting opinions in our political arena, it has become a bit of a “war” in the headlines as each try to disparage the other.”
Who are taking actions? 
Tim Berners – Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, was one of the persons who was alarmed by its effects. He said that the effect of fake news is increasingly concerning and disclosed plans to fight it.
These alarming occurrences has also alarmed big tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. On September last year, they joined a group of more than 30 news and technology companies to talk about the spread of fake news. Now, they have already made significant steps in battling this.
Facebook 

You may have noticed in your news feed the notification above from Facebook. That is just one of the steps Facebook is doing to battle the spread of fake news. They started publishing notifications about its “ 10 tips to spot fake news “at the top of every user’s news feed.
Another feature that Facebook has in its website is the fact-checking done by its partner organizations. These partner organizations are signatories of the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). What they do is that they flag news stories as either fake or not. Also, Facebook has introduced long ago the feature that allows all users to report the presence of fake news.

Just recently, Facebook has also cracked down 30, 000 fake accounts in France ahead of their presidential election. They said that the accounts were spreading fake news stories, spam, misinformation or other deceptive content. Facebook security manager Shabnam Shaik said,
“Our priority, of course, is to remove the accounts with the largest footprint, with a high amount of activity and a broad reach.”
Google 

The image above shows how Google is helping in handling fake news today. They have provided a tool called ‘Fact Check’. Here, Google will serve as a fact-checking website at the top of results. What will be showed is the person who made the verification claim, when they filed the claim, and the facts checked. These facts are presented by Google so as to help people have the right and informed judgments. This tool however does not provide all news stories of the review they need and is not yet available to all countries.
Us 
We ourselves can be a part of this battle against fake news. We do not need to be part of a tech giant or be a powerful or famous person to act. We can start by just even refraining to share these fake news we see, report it, and educate people who are gullible of being deceived by such.
Technology is power, and with great power comes great responsibility.

PayPal shares continue to stagnate. 
PayPal's business continues to grow at close to 20% net of currency. 
The company continues to dominate the mobile payment space which is growing at triple digit rates. 
The feuds the company has had with credit card issuers have been more or less abated with no real damage done to this company's business model. 
The company's Venmo service, still not producing revenues, continues to grow at triple digits and drive other PayPal engagement. PyPal - Some thoughts about disruption, monetization and competition PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) has not been the greatest stock to have owned in the 18 months or so since it was spun out of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) in the summer of 2015. The shares are up by a bit more than 10% over that span. Most other payment shares have done quite a bit better. The IGV tech/software index is up 25%. Some observers have predicted apocalyptic scenarios regarding the company's future. Other observers have simply thought it was too highly valued. The under-performance of the shares since the company became a public entity coupled with continued strong operating performance has had a significantly salutary impact on valuation. The apocalyptic scenarios-well just like those predicting the end of the world, they haven't played out yet. PayPal is a name in which investors have to look beyond the numbers in order to get comfort-or do they. It is cheaper than has been the case and it dominates one of the greater business opportunities in the tech world-that of mobile payments. Monetizing the mobile payments opportunity along- and it reputedly has a 41% share of the space-is likely worth more than the company's entire valuation. It is going to report its results in a couple of weeks-I expect the results to continue to show positive trends-but that has been true for the other quarters since this company has been independent. The consensus expectations, as portrayed by First Call, call for 16% top line growth and for EPS of $.41 for the quarter and $1.72 for the year. Why should the shares work this time around when they have done so little in terms of reacting to earnings releases over the recent past? What should the shares be worth? That there are many companies in the payment space is self-evident. I believe this company presents investors with the leading opportunity in e-payments and particularly mobile payments. And it is run by leaders who have a deep understanding of the space. Trying to quantify those contentions is an undertaking that is difficult if not impossible. And I say that as an analyst who likes numbers and prefers to quantify all that can be quantified. I might normally choose to put some kind of analysis of disruption, monetization and competition in PayPal's space further back in this article after discussing the company itself. Most readers know something about the company and many readers use some of its services. I use it myself and it has proven to be a useful tool for accepting payments. If you are under a certain age, PayPal, and its subsidiary Venmo , is how you send money and split the tab when you go out to eat-or drink. And it how you get money from your Aunts, Uncles and parents. But the share price performance of this company going forward is going to relate to how it solves the problems of being a disruptor or itself getting disrupted, how it monetizes some of its free services such as Venmo and how it competes both with existing competitors and new market entrants, particularly in the mobile payments space. So, I chose to start the article with comments that I most often put at the end. The company's financials are not that complicated. The company's prospects are considered by some to be more than a little murky. At the end of the day, for this company it is all about mobile payments. One can read the statistics about growth-or better y et, one can use mobile payments or use services such as Uber or Airbnb. Even to a very conservative writer as I am, it is apparent what is happening in the payments world. The company is one of the success stories of the Fin-Tech space and its peers are a host of other firms that both compete and partner with PayPal for processing payments. Last quarter, the company announced partnerships with both Citi (NYSE: C ) and Fidelity National (NYSE: FIS ). Investors have bought into the fin-tech story of recurring revenues and modest to moderate growth. They have been willing to value most fin-tech shares very highly because of growth stability and visibility. The PayPal story is a little different in that the growth is a bit beyond moderate. There is some concept amongst some investors that tech in general and fin-tech specifically is a zero-sum game. Competition is frenzied and competitors make wild, unsubstantiated claims as to how they are going to rule one little corner of the world. Mobile payments is really one of the more massive opportunities in the tech world these days. Today I have taken a train and paid for the ticket on a mobile app. I also used my phone to pay for coffee and pastry. The apps aren't quite seamless but they work - it is MetroNorth and nothing regarding the railroad is seamless. In time, most payments will be made on mobile devices even by technophobes. Much of the growth for payments space in the future is clearly going to be in its newer segments and most particularly in mobile. It is hard to dispute that PayPal has a leadership position in mobile payments these days. It is equally difficult to dispute that there are new entrants into the space with high levels of brand recognition Many commentators are concerned that ApplePay, AndroidPay and AmazonPay are going to damage the PayPal's growth prospects in mobile. As it happens, so far none of these entrants has been particularly successful with their technology. Mobile Payments itself is divided into many different nooks and crannies. One component of the space that is wildly popular amongst millennials is Venmo. Venmo is known as a service which lets parents send money to their kids in college. It is a service that can also be used to share a bar tab or a restaurant bill. But so far, Venmo hasn't generated any noticeable revenues. Obviously owning a site that is wildly attractive for payments within a certain demographic is a significant asset. There are opportunities to take Venmo into merchant transactions but that is nothing likely to move the meter in the short term. As can be seen in the attachment, Venmo and PayPal simply dominate the space and while the banks combined are pushing their alternative called clearXchange, now called Zelle, Venmo has a cult-like following amongst millennials. Does anyone really believe that the consortium of banks that owns Zelle is going to have a great deal of success in displacing Venmo. How might they do that? Given the lead Venmo has and its triple digit growth, how might that happen? Ask your own group of millennial contacts how they pay each other and why they like Venmo. It might surprise you. How do you quantify something that is offered for free? It is all about engagement. When you invest in tech growth stocks, you try to recognize that there are business opportunities that simply do not lend themselves to current quantification. When I look at either Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) or Shopify (NYSE: SHOP ), I do so knowing that I simply can't use typical valuation parameters. Venmo is something like that in that it produces little revenue currently that is traceable to the service. Venmo and the core of PayPal's mobile payments technology were acquired by PayPal back in 2013. I commented about the transaction in a prior article. These days, that $800 million acquisition seems like one of the bargains of this decade. I seriously doubt that I would be writing this article had it not happened. It is the Braintree technology stack that has vaulted PYPL into its leadership position in mobile payments. One finds the Braintree technology as the payment engine in services such as Uber and Airbnb. Many start-up mobile apps will instinctively turn to the Braintree technology which itself has brand recognition as well as technology that makes it easy to use as part of an overall service. I have used Venmo and don't quite see its attraction as something unique or part of the college experience. But then I do not like sending money to kids because they need to go to a concert or have a big date. It is convenient that Venmo is linked to my PayPal account I suppose, but I never had that much trouble sending money with PayPal. But of course I never knew that money had to be in an account in 20 minutes, either. Kids! How should investors value Venmo. It is one of the less tangible assets that allows investors to develop a higher growth rate construct for the company than might otherwise be the case. It is an asset that clearly has been copied but continues to lead its field. And it is one of the reasons to invest in PayPal shares. The key reason for investors to consider PayPal is the runway in mobile payments-the part of the space where merchants pay someone to facilitate the use of mobile devices to pay for things. To a certain extent, some of the stratagems that have been developed by participants in the space have been blind alleys. The switch from card swipes to contactless cards and phone taps has seemed to be more of a solution that isn't solving a problem. Do you really care if you swipe a card or insert it into a slot? But the use of different kinds of E-Commerce experiences, and particularly mobile E-Commerce to supplant physical shopping is almost a given at this point and PayPal is a leader in facilitating that trend. The last time I wrote an article about PayPal, I mentioned that one the company's significant assets was its COO Bill Ready. When investors are buying into a concept, one of the things into which they are buying is leadership. Mr. Ready doesn't get the public attention of someone like Evan Spiegel of Snap (NYSE: SNAP ) or Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). But in evaluating the future of a company that is in the business of overturning decade old payment technology, the bona fides of its leadership are key. Mr. Ready is one of the thought leaders of the mobile payments revolution-indeed he had been the CEO of Braintree and his role at PayPal makes it far more likely to come up with the next big things in the space. Again, investors can't quantify service offerings that do not yet exist. But I think it is fair to say that successfully technology investment, besides looking at traditional valuation metrics, also involves looking at senior management and their ability to innovate and make appropriate choices. Just to pick an example that is currently in style. What would Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) look like today but for the choices that were made by its current CEO in many areas over the years. The expectation is that Mr. Narayen will continue to make the right choices and it is my expectation that Mr. Ready and CEO Dan Shulman will continue to drive the right decisions at the right times for this company. My own thought is that if investors believe in the future of the mobile payments space, they are most likely to achieve that potential through investing in a company that is run by a team that includes one of the pioneers and thought leaders in the space. I don't think that most investors have the specific expertise to determine whether or not some specific feature or function that PYPL offers is unique or a competitive game changer. And I know I certainly lack that kind of ability. But it is reasonable to look at the record of PayPal's COO and believe that the company does have that kind of expertise which is likely to leave the company with a significant competitive moat. The issue of MasterCard and Visa I believe that one of the principle issues that investors have dealt with in making an investment decision regarding PayPal is their concern about current and potential competition between PYPL and what are perceived to be rivals such as Visa (NYSE: V ) and MasterCard (NYSE: MC ). Last summer, peace was declared and agreements were disclosed. The principle parts of the agreement included an agreement in which PayPal stops steering Visa cardholders from using their Visa cards for PayPal transactions. In exchange, Visa has opened up its tap and pay application to PayPal's mobile app. At the time the accord was signed, analysts were concerned that the economics of the deal would eat into PayPal's margins. PayPal's core business is to facilitate the payments users make for merchandise and services by accessing their bank balances and transferring payments to vendors. It makes far less money if the transfer comes through the Visa interconnection. PayPal and MasterCard have a similar arrangement and most of the other major card issuers have reached agreements on working with PayPal by this time. I am not going to try to evaluate the specifics of the transactions between the rivals. There are too many statistics necessary that are not in the public domain for anyone to develop a credible analysis of what happened and what might reasonably be expected. But the future for PayPal is not so much in dealing with credit card issuers as it is in dealing with the mobile payments world. The heart of PayPal's mobile payment offering is called OneTouch. More and more millennials are using One-Touch as their payment methodology of choice where it is offered. And OneTouch these days is very easy to use and allows customers to checkout without entering their user name and password. It is the technology that facilitates payments inside of apps such as Airbnb, StubHub, ParkWhiz. The real competition that PayPal will have going forward isn't Visa and MasterCard but Stripe , a start-up on-line payment company that offers many of the same set of features and functions offered by PayPal and did so in advance of the current OneTouch offering. Without discussing the differences and similarities in detail, the huge growth in digital and mobile payments ought to allow for at least two successful vendors in the space. Why does PayPal draw those awful negative reviews and what do its finances actually reveal PayPal shares may not have seemed to be controversial-and yet their performance seemingly belies the ratings of analysts who publish their recommendations on First Call. Perhaps it has been the company's rather unusual tenure as a subsidiary of an unrelated entity, eBay. At this point, eBay, while still a significant component of payment volume at 16% of the total has been dwarfed by other sources of transactions. Mobile is now 33% of total spend On PayPal. Perhaps it is the view that if PayPal is successful, it must mean that Visa and MasterCard will suffer. Perhaps it is the level of stock based compensation expense although at 4% of revenues and 24% of non-GAAP earnings, it is not at extraordinary levels even compared to peers in the payment space. One of the principle concerns expressed about the company since it has become public relates to its declining take-rate which so the theory holds, will hobble margins and ultimately growth as PayPal services become more commoditized. That theory seems less viable with passing quarters and indeed, the decline in the take rate was smallest in Q4 than in all of the quarters since PayPal became an independent public company. As discussed earlier, the company entered into agreements with both Visa and MasterCard that it has artfully described as consumer choice transactions. During the 4th quarter, the impact was well within prior expectations. Volume based expenses grew by 27%, but transaction margins remained healthy at about 58%. In all, transaction expenses were just shy of $1 billion in the quarter and were 32% of revenue for the quarter compared to 29% of revenue in Q4 of 2015. That difference would appear to be the impact of the company's agreements with major credit card issuers on margins. Overall, the company saw a 25% increase in payment volume and a 19% increase in net revenues. Over the course of last several quarters, some analysts have expressed concerns relating to the company's position in extending loans to some consumers of its service. Transaction and loan losses were 10% of revenues during the quarter compared to 9.6% of revenues the prior year and appeared to be consistent with prior expectations for that metric. The company has expressed its intention of moving much of its consumer lending business off-balance sheet and utilizing 3 rd party funding. Many observers will be happy to see a lower level of consumer receivables outstanding on the company's balance sheet. Given the interest rates the company charges and the demand for credit, the company is not expected to have much trouble in finding 3rd party funding sources to enable the company to minimize the capital it devotes to credit services. During the course of the conference call, the company discussed the growth in other operating expenses outside of credit losses. Overall, operating expense on a GAAP basis rose by 8.5% year over year and was 36% of revenues compared to 38% of revenues the prior year. Overall, GAAP operating income was 15% of revenues compared to 16% the prior year, while non-GAAP operating income margin rose, due both to higher stock based comp and depreciation expense. I think that in terms of margins going forward, there are probably as many secular tail winds as headwinds. It was, I thought, telling that the company was able to actually reduce sales and marketing expense in actual dollars year on year in Q4 and to limit the increase in research and development costs to just 3% year on year. I would expect that the costs for running the network and general and administrative expense will show more favorable trends in 2017 to allow the company to maintain margins even if it sustains lower margins on transactions. The company is forecasting flat to slightly up non-GAAP operating margins in the current year, even after some impact from the costs of its hedging program and FX headwinds in aggregate. The company to the surprise of some analysts increased its expectations for revenue growth this current year by a few hundred basis points compared to its prior estimates. The company has some discrete service offerings, and in particular One Touch, that are taking off at this point and the company apparently has been able to use the Venmo offering to accelerate the growth of revenues for services that bring revenue to PayPal. The company has developed lots of payment relationships with companies such as Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU ) and Facebook that tend to be unheralded but which, in aggregate are apparently starting to move the meter in terms of revenue growth. (FB has recently launched a group payment option within its Messenger that is similar to Venmo but it is not a serious rival to Venmo at this time.) The company is actually forecasting FX neutral revenue growth of 17%-19%, just slightly less than the 21% constant currency revenue growth achieved in 2016. Given that foreign revenue is just slightly less than half of the total, FX is a substantial and essentially unknowable factor in forecasting revenue growth over any significant time period. Given the many secular tailwinds the company has, and the rapid growth of its newer services and partnerships, I think the odds favor that the company is likely to over-attain revenue guidance this year as was the case last year. Overall, the shares have an average rating of buy from the 40+ analysts who report their recommendations to First Call but 13 of the analysts covering the name consider it a hold and earlier this week it was downgraded by a European brokerage, National Bank, AG. The downgrade, apparently, from buy to sell, was related to valuation but it is not all that easy to understand given PayPal's share price stagnation, both this quarter and going back over some period. Valuation Is valuation stretched? I don't think so because I think the company has made the right strategic moves and has built a commanding position in the mobile payments space that is undervalued. I think that the issues that animated concern last year in terms of the company's agreements with credit card issuers in retrospect seem significantly overblown. I think the company, over time, will better monetize the payments it facilitates through Venmo. And given the company's management, I expect that it will continue to innovate with new payment services that will be able to generate revenue that is not yet forecasted. The recent announcement of PayPal's purchase of TIO Networks, while obviously not of huge significance in terms of currently projected financials, is an example of payment niches, as yet under-exploited, that are likely to add to the company's growth rate over time. PayPal's shares closed Thursday at $42.55 . With 1.2 billion shares outstanding (essentially unchanged year over year), the company has a market capitalization of about $52 billion. The company has a total net cash balance of cash and equivalents, including long term investments of $6.5 billion which yields an enterprise value of $45.5 billion. At the current forecast revenue level of about $12.6 billion for the year, the EV/S is 3.6X. That is what happens when shares stagnate and revenues grow. At that valuation level, PayPal shares are valued at significantly below that of most other companies in the payment space and are arguably growing significantly faster. The company is forecasting non-GAAP EPS of $1.72 for the current year with its expectation of flat margins. That is a P/E of 24.7X. Again, on a reported earnings basis, PayPal is one of the less expensive of the larger payment vendors around. PayPal is forecasting free cash flow of greater than $2.7 billion for the year. including capex of about $600 million. Last year CFFO grew by 24% and free cash flow was $2.55 billion. I would be surprised if the company saw such a small increase in free cash flow this year based on its earnings forecast and the other trends in cash flow. But using the forecast provided by management the free cash flow yield of almost 6%, one of the highest free cash flow yields seen in the space and one of the higher free cash flow yields available in a company growing organically close to 20%. About 20% of the company's free cash flow is a product of stock based comp, again a relatively low metric for that calculation. At this point, PayPal does not pay a dividend but is buying back shares at a modest pace. Clearly, with free cash flow of $2.7 billion, in can achieve a more optimal capital allocation strategy for shareholders or execute a significant acquisition. 80% of the company's cash balance is off-shore and thus it has been reluctant to pay the taxes necessary to redeploy the capital in order to pay dividends. Should the tax laws change, management has foreshadowed that it will reconsider that strategy although the payment of a 1%-2% dividend is not necessarily a game-changer for many potential investors. It has not been uncommon amongst investors to use some form of sum of the parts to justify valuation. It is worth noting that the company most talked about in the payments space these days is Stripe which has a valuation of $9.2 billion . Strip has about 1/3 rd the market share of PayPal in mobile payments at the moment, as best as can be determined. Just how the volumes of services such as Uber and Airbnb figure into that calculation is not known by this writer. It is not easy to determine which service is growing faster in the mobile space. But if the math is worth doing, the mobile payments component of Paypal ought to be worth $27 billion and perhaps more. That would leave the rest of PayPal valued at less than $20 billion. How much my Venmo be worth? How much is the balance of PayPal's e-commerce revenues worth? Probably a considerable multiple of $20 billion. Stripe is a poster child as a e-payments unicorn but it doesn't have Venmo and it doesn't power payments for Airbnb or Uber or Lyft etc. One can't buy Stripe shares and the boyish looking founder, Patrick Collison says an IPO is not imminent . Almost certainly, if Stripe were to do an IPO it would almost certainly command a premium over its last valuation when it was funded toward the end of 2016. Attempting to invest in the mobile payments space, if it can reasonably done, is not a hard decision to make. I think buying PayPal shares at their current valuation is a more than reasonable strategy to accomplish that objective at a valuation that can be readily justified. Maybe not as exciting as an IPO in Strip might be, but a good investment that can produce positive alpha. It is worth looking at before earnings, I believe.

Photo by KieferPix/Shutterstock Copyright © 2017 HealthDay 

Workaholism, it seems, is the new black.

People who complain endlessly about being overworked and overwhelmed may be sending others a less-than-subtle message: ""I'm more important than you.""

So finds new research suggesting that some Americans are eschewing old tipoffs to status -- weekday rounds of golf and months-long vacations.

Instead, higher status is now transmitted by at least claiming to be oh so busy.

[post_ads]""In the past, living a leisurely life and not working was the most powerful way to signal one's status,"" explained study lead author Silvia Bellezza.

""Fast-forward to America today, and complaining about being busy and working all the time -- rather than being on holiday -- has become increasingly common,"" said Bellezza. She's an assistant professor of marketing at Columbia University in New York City.

Bellezza's team conducted a series of experiments focused on what psychologists call ""status attribution"" -- characteristics that help establish an individual's position in society.

These status-markers can change with time. So to examine current ""status attributions,"" the researchers first reviewed 1,100 examples of online ""humble-bragging.""

""Humble-brags"" are a form of showing off by feigning self-deprecation. For example, ""I'm just so swamped by all my charity work.""

Most of the social media humble-brags in the study were placed on Twitter by well-known celebrities, Bellezza's team said. The posts had one thing in common: a tendency to complain about 'having no life' or 'being in desperate need for a vacation.' ""

Another experiment asked participants to indicate whether they thought ""being busy"" meant spending a lot of time at work, spending a lot of time performing house-related chores, or spending a lot of time engaged with hobbies or leisure activities.

A third study recruited about 300 men and women who were asked to guess the social status and wealth of a series of Facebook users who had posted updates on leisure activities or workplace busyness.

The take-home message from the experiments: Americans viewed relentless work in a more favorable light than they did leisure-seeking.

Brand and product use tended to reinforce this view, with services such as dog-walkers or online grocery purchasing designed with the busy worker in mind. Use of these services connotes higher status, the researchers said, in the same way that owning an expensive watch or purse might have in the past.

However, one other experiment suggested that America's glorification of the ""busy-bee"" lifestyle might not be shared by people in other countries.

Comparing people from the United States and Italy, Bellezza and her colleagues found that Italians still placed a higher value on a more leisurely life versus the career ""rat race.""
[post_ads_2]
Why would Americans be enamored of working too hard? It might be due to being ""heavily influenced by our own beliefs in social mobility,"" according to Bellezza.

""The more we believe that one has the opportunity for social affirmation based on hard work,"" she noted, ""the more we tend to think that people who skip leisure, and work all the time, are of higher standing.""

Bellezza added that the move to a more service-oriented economy has also likely encouraged the shift. She theorized that people with busy jobs involving information processing may be perceived as more talented and skillful compared with, say, someone on a factory floor.

The study appeared in a recent issue of the Journal of Consumer Research.

Seth Kaplan is an associate professor of industrial/organizational psychology at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. Reviewing the new findings, he said they ""are consistent with other research indicating that reporting being busy and even 'stressed' is socially desirable.""

[post_ads]In fact, not projecting such stress could prove problematic, given the ""potential inference is that that person is lazy and/or incompetent,"" Kaplan said.

""[But] what is perhaps especially interesting about this effect,"" Kaplan added, ""is that the evidence does not conclusively show that leisure time is actually decreasing,"" he noted.

""Although there is some debate in this area, most time-use data suggest that American leisure time has not decreased -- at least not significantly so -- in recent years,"" Kaplan said. ""We tend to just perceive and/or report that it has.""

The over N13billion recovered by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) from an Ikoyi apartment in Lagos was a discreet allocation released to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) for major but covert security projects. 
The total value of the cash at Central Bank of Nigeria official exchange rate is over N13 billion. 
What are the secret details? Inside sources revealed that, 
former President Goodluck Jonathan approved the funds for the 30-year old secret service agency after its immediate past Director General, Olaniyi Oladeji, alerted him to the need for some “crucial and covert security projects”. 

The funds were later released in cash directly from the Central Bank of Nigeria as a way of making its spending completely secret. 

“The projects are scattered across the country, but there is a major one in Lagos being funded with the cash warehoused in the Ikoyi building,” one source told PT. “The spending on the projects cannot be subjected to the usual expenditure process, and that is why the funds are held in cash. If you like, you can call it illegal projects in the national interest.” 

Our sources said only relevant top government officials and of the NIA are aware of the projects. 
One official said when the incumbent Director General of the NIA, Ayodele Oke, was alerted that EFCC operatives had swooped on the apartment, being discreetly guarded by covert operatives, he rushed to the anti-graft agency’s headquarters in Abuja to advise its chairman, Ibrahim Magu, to withdraw his men as the funds belonged to government. 


At the time, about 13 police officers and some soldiers, accompanied by photographers and videographers, had broken into the apartment, and were already dismantling the safes in which the funds were concealed, our sources said. 

Mr. Magu however declined Mr. Oke’s request and directed his men to proceed with the operation as he had no security information backing the claim. 
A frustrated Mr. Oke was said to have rushed to National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to complain, and the huge embarrassment he had caused his otherwise extremely quiet and secretive agency. 

Presidency sources said Mr Oke met President Buhari in company of Attorney General Abubakar Malami to table the same complaints. 

Those who saw the NIA DG before he was called in to see the president said he had two bulky envelopes believed to contain paper and audio-visual records of the security projects. 

Officials said President Buhari has since directed Mr. Magu to forward to him detailed report on the operation. The EFCC boss was also directed to immediately deposit the funds with the CBN. 

On his part, Mr. Oke was asked to document his complaints and then reapply for the seized funds. 

A top presidency source said the President might ask Attorney General Malami to review reports submitted by the two officials, and then forward appropriate recommendations. 

When contacted Friday, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said, “It’s a security issue, and not strictly a presidency issue.” 

He directed further enquiries on the matter to the security agencies involved. 

Mr Oke of NIA confirmed to PT that the cash belongs to his agency but declined further comments when asked what the funds were meant for. 

“You don’t expect me to tell you that,” he said.

This book played with my emotions and took me to places that I typically read about and pray that I never experience in real life. Death in the City most certainly lives up to its title and cover. This is the third book I’ve read by Keith Kareem Williams and he has earned both my respect and my readership, making his way up my list of favorite authors.
The synopsis reads: A mother loses her son and completely loses her faith in the God she had served faithfully for her entire life. Trapped lovers try desperately to escape a lifestyle that, for a time, had comforted and kept them alive in a city that has always been trying to devour them. A reluctant assassin crosses paths with a woman who is determined to collect a pound of flesh from those in her debt for what they had cruelly taken from her. A frustrated husband and hard worker seeks escape from the life he has come to hate. A young girl can’t free herself from the grinning predator who has ruined her childhood because almost no one can recognize her silent cries for help. A young detective risks his life to prove that all policemen aren’t evil and that some who wore the badge were still true to their sworn oath to protect and serve, despite all of the wickedness they found themselves drowning in. All of these stories cross, intersect, twist and intertwine to create a graphic, beautifully ugly, savage depiction of what life-and-death looks like in the city. 
Where do I begin? Usually, I can jump right into my thoughts about books I read, but this one…I finished this book about a week before I started the review because I had to digest it all. If you’ve read my review of Williams’ book Glass Goddesses, Concrete Walls , then you know how I feel about his style. His favorite word is savage and in staying true to himself and his style, that is how I would describe much of the content of Death in the City. Why? Well, since I’m trying to figure out where to begin, I’ll start at the beginning.
Two lovers are desperate to leave the life of illegal activity to walk the straight and narrow, but what happens when you live by the sword? According to the Greek tragedy Agamemnon , the Book of Matthew and other parallel proverbs, you die by it. Within the first few chapters there is love, regret, spiritual and existential conflict, graphic sex and even more graphic violence. You know, all of the good stuff. Based on that, the reader already knows that the couple who opens the story will not be the couple who finishes it. From there, we are introduced to characters who are seemingly unrelated, yet a very important prop is carried from one sub-plot to the next connecting everyone despite the majority of the characters never meeting each other. Something along the lines of Six Degrees of Separation. Among all of the sub-plots are a mother who is still grieving over the loss of her son at the hands of police, a husband and wife with a dull marriage that ends in a crime of passion, and a teenage girl who isn’t being heard.
Based on little tidbits that the author has shared, this novel was intended to be a screenplay, yet for whatever reason he decided to share the story in book form. There were certain aspects, particularly a specific storyline that made me feel like I was watching instead of reading. The assassin and the vengeful woman, at times, made me feel like I was watching an Al Pacino flick, which was greatly appreciated by myself because it wasn’t as real to me as every other storyline.
Williams dealt with some extremely real subjects. Too real. Crime of passion: I don’t know about anyone else, but I’ve read my fair share of headlines, especially in recent weeks, involving jilted, crazed lovers/husbands/wives who’ve hurt or murdered their so-called loved ones and sometimes themselves. Despite the heinous nature of acts such as murder, I don’t think the feeling of rage and heartbreak is that foreign to most people. Even though we condemn the people who commit these types of crimes, how many stories have we heard of people who managed to stop themselves before they reached the point of murder, stopping at slashing tires, destroying belongings, etc.
Drug dealers and thieves, not everyone knows one personally, but for those of us who do, we hate to see news reports or hearing through the grapevine that so-and-so was killed and nobody knows what (or nobody will tell what they know) happened. Protesters marching, hashtags and videos going viral of police violence and both sides being tried and judged in the court of public opinion long before they reach a court of law— if they ever reach that point. Then there’s the good cop who just can’t seem to outshine or outdo the bad ones. Williams brought all of that from the headlines and put it right into the readers’ laps. Even with me living near one of the major cities that made the news in recent months due to a police shooting and the protests that followed, leaving me feeling nervous to leave home in the days that immediately followed that event, Death in the City made me feel like I was there witnessing the events unfold in person beyond three dimensional reality into something totally different. Remember how I said in my review of Glass Goddesses that I literally felt like I was a fly on the wall? Yeah, that applies to this novel, too.
There were a couple of characters I wondered about. What happened to them after their respective scenes? Their whereabouts weren’t critical to the story moving forward, so they served their purpose. I was just curious, especially about the grieving mother. What was her thought process after the events in the novel took place?
What stuck out in my mind the most out of everything was the teenage girl and her boyfriend who just wanted to run away from all of their troubles— and trust that they had MAJOR troubles— because sometimes I want to run away, too, and my troubles are nothing like theirs. I couldn’t and didn’t want to imagine what they must have felt like and if I had been in their shoes, I would’ve wanted to do the same thing.
One little thing that I really liked was the name of the assassin, Crowe. If I had to guess, the author chose that name for a purpose, but it is possible I’m reading too much into it. Crows are black birds, though not necessarily blackbirds, and are often associated with bad omens, death and darkness. Crowe killed people for a living and owned a cemetery. To quote the thought of his female companion “…crows were the guardians of the dead souls that remained here stubbornly after they should’ve moved on to the other side.” p.209 
Crowe’s profession, Death, is the one thing above all else that every living thing has in common, so for the author to make the connection between strangers even more seamless—I loved it. I can’t say that I enjoyed this novel because I don’t feel that enjoy is an appropriate word for a novel such as this, but I really appreciated the author’s ability to tell this story. I give it a 4.5/5 stars.
Death in the City is available for purchase on Amazon , Barnes & Noble and the author’s website . Keith Kareem Williams also sells his books and can be reached via his social media pages.

""It is with heavy hearts that we notify everyone of the passing of our beloved father,"" she posted on Facebook. ""We would appreciate privacy and time while we grieve the loss of our dad, granddad, friend and musical genius. We will update close friends and family when service arrangements have been made and will notify the public of an open memorial service, which all would be welcome. We are undeniably still in shock with his unexpected death and cannot begin to put into words the overwhelming sadness we are experiencing. He is missed tremendously."" — Louise, Sam, Emily & Rori At press time, further details were sketchy, and we will continue to develop this story. Guitar Player just reviewed his latest box set in the May 2017 issue: The Man Who Changed Guitar Forever Allan Holdsworth It’s not often that Guitar Player is credited with naming an album, but our April 2008 cover story on Holdsworth inspired the title of this massive 12-CD box set. I’d say, “Thanks and bravo,” but, apparently, the maestro was somewhat embarrassed by the slogan. Not that he should be, because this collection of albums from 1982’s I.O.U to 2003’s Then! proves Holdsworth’s astonishing technique, unbridled creativity, iridescent tone, dynamic touch, exquisite taste, and expansive melodic strategies have absolutely changed guitarcraft for any player aspiring beyond his or her first barre chord. It’s a humbling experience to relive these seminal albums—how can he be so imaginative and, well, scary brilliant?—but it’s also a treasure trove of possibilities and vision. Dive in and be changed.

0,jangguttipis,2017-04-16T11:02:34.000+03:00,['https://www.twitch.tv/events/19169'],,,english,0,2017-04-15T17:09:00.000+03:00,,"Catching opponents as they leap and use an up and special attack to catch just enough verticality and nab the edge of a stage can prove really difficult in Super Smash Bros. , but doing so successfully often leaves both players with a sense of wonder. How did that happen? How does that happen? Many video games paint the struggle between two players in stark realities that belie the beauty or overt fantasy on-screen and to that end, Smash stands alone in fighting games.
Thinking about a contest between two players enjoying a shooter game or two others playing a strategy game colors the interactions in Smash as merely fanciful, childlike action-figure brawling. Standing up against a game like Street Fighter IV or its numerous balancing iterations, Smash starts to quickly approach a Ty Beanie Baby brawl or a ball pit deep enough for even the most grown men to swim in. Still, where the experience felt solid and satisfying on Nintendo 3DS , it inevitably feels like a brand-new generation of heated battle on Wii U with snappy controls, gorgeous graphics and animations, and for the first time in the franchise 8-player fights.
I tended to leap into a standard battle immediately before taking on a larger or lengthier challenge in which the game offers a series of battles or the opportunity to earn bigger rewards for completing a more difficult battle. Smash Run Tour, the single-player adventure-esque side-scrolling mode that offers lots of rewards and fighting variety returns and looks fantastic on big-screen TVs. It still represents the best place to collect new items for custom fighters and coin for the trophy gashapon. You’ll want to stock up on special moves and costume gear in order to separate your favorite brawler from everyone else online.
Perhaps more importantly for fans of the series dedicated to discovering unique ways of moving faster, hitting harder, and generally out-thinking their opponent, this Wii U version largely addresses any control issues you may have had on Nintendo 3DS. Some folks found that their circle pad wasn’t up to the task for the portable version and on Wii U the GamePad or remote and Nunchuk analog sticks completely fix this. Further, Nintendo has offered a bundle at retail packaging a USB adapter for GameCube controllers. If you’ve still got purple pads tangled up in your gaming corner, they’ll get plenty of exercise with Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and new productions of these controllers are also available at retail.
Through both playtime on Wii U and unlocking every character on Nintendo 3DS, this iteration has revealed itself as one that can cater to both hardcore tournament competitors and anyone willing to play Mario Kart . These are two incredibly far removed groups considering the ubiquity and longevity of Mario Kart , but it stands to reason that this flexibility proves invaluable.
I had a friend over to play this past weekend before the game releases, before I could even speak at length about the experience and how it differs from the portable version. While there was a little consternation as to who had to use a Wii remote and Nunchuk (get the GameCube adapter, people!), launching into a match with random characters proved entertaining at great lengths. I used an amiibo Nintendo included in the review package shipped to me and we soon found that the little figurine was mopping stages up with both computer and human players alike.
A six-player battle, as opposed to the full eight-player match, also offered a unique opportunity for higher point tallies while retaining the tight controls for lengthy combos. Chaining a few of Sonic’s spin dash moves or trying to hit up and special attack at just the right time with Mario satisfies just a little bit more in slightly more crowded battlefields. There’s plenty of that in other game modes too. I loved exploring branching paths with variable rewards in Classic. Special Smash modes offer options for battling with scores of Mii fighters, if that’s your prerogative. Collecting things in-game can be dizzying with the insurmountable number and variety, but doing so leaves an intense sense of reward behind that pounding start for the next match gets too easy.
It’ll be the number and extreme variation in character design and movesets that will make Super Smash Bros. for 3DS second place in a one-on-one, one stock match with this Wii U version. Unfortunately for the portable version, console graphics and larger, clearer characters allow for more precise control. This leads to more heated matches, higher damage totals, and an exacting sense of fun that seeks players out not unlike a level-9 CPU Pikachu with a down and special thunder attack locked and loaded.
I can’t help it. Playing Smash with bright, highly stylized graphics, incredibly fast action, and wide choice of opponents both online and offline makes this Wii U’s slam dunk of 2014. It feels like a new definition of Nintendo, beyond what you expect of characters even as outside the Mushroom Kingdom as Kirby or the Fire Emblem crew. Between a snappy and animated user interface and the huge selection of music ranging the company’s portfolio, it’ll be hard to say any other game from the company could feel this complete.
It’s true that Super Smash Bros. evolves every time with regard to new features, items, and characters to choose from. While your favorite character may not return or a few annoying pickups may force you to turn off items altogether, this represents the biggest leap forward Smashers have seen yet. The group stands apart from other fighting game communities and it’s even taken Nintendo some time to come around to offer support for the tournament scene. Still, no one can deny the game’s appeal and it’d be hard to find someone who doesn’t feel comfortable picking up a controller for a casual match.
Take Captain Falcon, Bowser, and Pit to the mat with your favorite Pokémon to find out for yourself. With or without classic Gamecube controllers, regardless as to whether you invest in amiibo figures or not (notice I haven’t mentioned them much in this review), and whether or not you even know who these characters are, Smash is fun . That’s one of the most boring words to use in a video game review, I know, but I can’t sum it up any other way. Nintendo’s developers made it an obvious objective and they’ve unequivocally hit the motherload. You’ll feel like you did too, so make sure you’re tossing opponents off-stage to explore it all.

Soon, we might. 
While nothing is set, Major League Baseball and umps are expected to discuss a plan — most prominently used in the NFL — for crew chiefs to wear a microphone and explain replay rulings. 
Under one possible scenario, they would start at the All-Star Game on July 11 in Miami, tweak the process over the season's second half and then go forward with the experiment in the playoffs. 
People familiar with the talks spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because an agreement has not yet been reached. 
Last year, MLB asked for the plate ump to wear a mic at the All-Star Game, but there wasn't enough time to do it. 
The umpires are in the middle of their five-year labor deal and any change would involve negotiations, plus a comfort level on both sides that the system would be efficient, accurate and easy. 
So no way to say for sure if fans at Camden Yards, Coors Field and ballparks across the majors will become familiar with the voices of veteran crew chiefs — be it country singer Joe West, ordained minister Ted Barrett or Dale Scott, once a Top 40 AM radio disc jockey. 
""It probably would be nice to get a little more explanation,"" Marlins reliever Brad Ziegler said. ""They're supposed to say the call stands or the call's confirmed. 'The call stands' means you can't tell. A lot of times we don't get that ... they just signal out or safe. That's all we get on the field. 
""They may announce it on the PA, but it doesn't seem like that is consistent in all parks. And the acoustics in the stadium here — we have a hard time hearing what's on the PA in the bullpen,"" he said. 
In the NFL, hearing refs announce ""upon further review"" has long been part of the lexicon. The lore includes what Ben Dreith said in a 1986 game, when Jets lineman Marty Lyons tangled with Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly and was penalized for ""giving him the business down there."" 
The NHL for some time has mic'ed up officials to explain coach's challenges, based on what the central replay booth tells them. 
NBA crew chiefs put on headsets to watch reviews and talk with the replay center. Decisions are explained to the official scorer's table and the benches, and the public address announcers inform the crowd. 
MLB has tried to speed up reviews this year, aiming for the umpires in the New York replay booth to relay the final calls to the field in under 2 minutes. 
""It'll take more time,"" Boston pitcher David Price said. ""It's not going to make them any shorter."" 
As for making the replay system more informative and entertaining, ""Yeah, until they have a problem with the umpire's mic,"" he said. 
Marlins star Christian Yelich said a switch wouldn't affect him. 
""The call's the call,"" he said. ""Just because they tell you what they decided isn't going to change it.""","When fans see red, MLB men in blue may soon explain replays",http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Rp_5vv9o81zfUkelyP4A43rZ1ATj6zE94gtO_Bh3ChlDQTY.utN7VNe.qQEltR91Cungp_kPSM5XPaKq7h0pn,f35ea89b289aed743a70c62f2d5e2e6baaf49736,www.thenewstribune.com,,http://www.thenewstribune.com/sports/?widgetName=rssfeed&widgetContentId=712015&getXmlFeed=true,College & professional Sports news | TheNewsTribune.com &,US,40831.0,0,thenewstribune.com,1,"When fans see red, MLB men in blue may soon explain replays",0.0,news,0,"[{'sentiment': 'neutral', 'name': 'joe west'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'christian yelich'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'dale scott'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'delino deshields'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ben dreith'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'brad ziegler'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'willson contreras'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ben walker'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'ted barrett'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'jim kelly'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'david price'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'adrian gonzalez'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'marty lyons'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'new york'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'texas'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'coors field'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'arlington'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'camden yards'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'miami'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'boston'}]","[{'sentiment': 'neutral', 'name': 'mlb'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'cleveland indians'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'cubs'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'nhl'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'texas rangers'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'nfl'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'associated press'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'jets'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'nba'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'major league baseball'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'buffalo'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'marlins'}]"

Elizabeth of York ( Jodie Comer ) was automatically the character that the viewer rooted for during In Bed with the Enemy . She was the underdog in the episode, the claimed spoil of war who was being forced into marrying not only a stranger but one of the people responsible for her true love (King Richard III)’s death. Elizabeth had to reign in: anger, the thirst for revenge, profound sadness, and anxiety over her fate and that of her immediate family so that she could make critical decisions that would open doors or seal her fate. Throughout In Bed with the Enemy , Elizabeth proved herself to be no wallflower, no passenger in a ship without a helmsman. Elizabeth stood up for herself from the beginning, wearing her position like a suit of armor, her words and her actions her shield and sword. The highlight of this was the tit-for-tat that King of England Henry VII ( Jacob Collins-Levy ) had with Elizabeth of York during an impromptu dinner and coital session. Their mutual disdain was the real meal that they feasted upon. Their dessert was the pressures of their positions. When it came to the king, the pressure to marry someone fertile that could produce a royal heir. Those societal pressures forced one into the other during a sexual encounter that could adequately be described as two people dispassionately clocked in at work. Henry VII’s passion and decision-making ability were on full display as he held his first royal audience during In Bed with the Enemy . King Henry truly wanted to kill the last York heir during In Bed with the Enemy but he also wanted to be even-handed and fair. Henry VII wanted to spare the youth’s life. That moment lay on a knife’s edge. The audience in attendance knew it. The York youth was one more outburst away from being behead or at least thrown into the Tower of London. The power, brains, and ambition behind-the-throne in In Bed with the Enemy were Dowager Queen Elizabeth ( Essie Davis ) and Queen Mother Margaret Beaufort ( Michelle Fairley ). During the episode, both women schemed but it was Dowager Queen Elizabeth whose machinations created the drama throughout the episode. Because of her former position, Dowager Queen Elizabeth knew what was going to happen before it happened. She not only knew the play book, she’d owned her own copy when in power and would have used similar tactics had power and position suddenly been thrust into her hands. That foreknowledge allowed her to stay one step ahead of her enemies throughout the episode. Elizabeth of York’s strength came from her mother’s example. Elizabeth of York’s secret motto (“Hidden and Patient”) and resolve (e.g. squeezing blood out of her foot to preserve her reputation) were born out of it. As Elizabeth of York’s eyes filled with tears during the closing moments of In Bed with the Enemy , the viewer saw that secret motto burning in her eyes. Like all palace intrigue TV series, The White Princess filled its premiere episode with competing interests, the high thrown low, the low raised high, rewards, punishments, renewed alliances, and subjugation. By all indications, no narrative stone (with regard to the time period, society, and setting – England, August 1485, after the Battle of Bosworth) will be left un-turned by The White Princess .

The proposal, which said Facebook had provided ""a financial mechanism supporting fabricated content"" on the internet, suggests the company review the issue broadly, including the extent to which it blocks fake posts, how its strategies impact free speech and how it evaluates claims in posts.
""Facebook is highly vulnerable, as fake news promoters are spamming their way to visibility for fake news through strategically gaming Facebook’s algorithms and publishing platform,"" the proposal states.
""In light of the societal crisis generated by the explosion of fake news and related hate speech, failure to effectively manage this issue creates public policy risk,"" it said.
The issue of fake news came to prominence during the U.S. presidential election last year, when many inaccurate posts were widely shared on Facebook and other social media services. Facebook has said it is tackling the problem.
It already has a program in France to use outside fact-checkers to combat fake news in users' feeds and suspended 30,000 accounts in France on Thursday, ahead of the country's presidential election.
Separately, shareholders also proposed a gender pay equality report be prepared by December.
The proposal recommends the company disclose the percentage pay gap between male and female employees across race and ethnicity, policies taken to address the gap, the methodology used to take those measures, and targets that could be set to reduce the gap.
Facebook's board of directors have recommended a vote against both proposals.

I am talking about the BLM’s and the SHOW US YOUR TAX RETURN loud mouths. I find it so telling of their hypocrisy – How they are demanding Pres. Trump release his tax returns but are totally SILENT about the SEALED RECORDS of Obama. Now we have Lois Lerner who KNOWS her testimony will expose the corruption in the IRS – especially during the Obama reign. Why is it the LEFT can hide and SEAL their corruption and deception but they demand that the Conservative side release everything including their used toilet paper… I also find it comical that they are demanding Pres. Trump release his tax returns and Lois Lerner is requesting her IRS time testimony be SEALED. What better example of the hypocrisy can there be???? Oh, and let’s not forget the millions that Al Sharpton owes the IRS and he still walks about a free man… ~ Jackie Juntti (Granny) Lois Lerner: “Public Can Never Know What I Did” Former Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner Embattled ex-IRS executive Lois Lerner was in federal court last week, asking a judge to seal her forthcoming deposition due to the inflammatory nature of her testimony. Lerner told the judge that if her actions at the IRS were to become public knowledge, she could face death threats from angry Americans – particularly those on the conservative side of the spectrum. Lerner is well-known for her role in the IRS’s partisan targeting of Tea Party groups; under the Obama administration, the IRS singled out nonprofit groups with conservative, Tea Party-ish style names for extra scrutiny. Many of their cases lingered in limbo for years while the IRS pretended to review their applications. Ultimately, there came to be no denying that there was a systematic, political effort inside the IRS to make life as difficult as possible for groups seen as threats to Obama’s agenda. Lerner and Holly Paz are scheduled to testify in a class action lawsuit against the IRS, which is being brought by 428 groups who were affected by the targeting scandal. But before the pair commit their testimony to record, they want assurances that what they say will never be read by the public. “Ms. Lerner and Paz have demonstrated that the public dissemination of their deposition testimony would expose them and their families to harassment and a credible risk of violence and physical harm,” their lawyer said in documents to the court. Reportedly, the women have submitted evidence to the judge that shows they’ve already received threats couched in “graphic, profane, and disturbing language.” No matter what the judge decides, the request itself has put the IRS scandal back in the headlines, and it comes at a time when Republicans want the Justice Department to re-open the case against Lerner. They say she deliberately obstructed the congressional investigation into the targeting and may have even contributed to it with her snide emails about Republicans. Lois in Chains??? If Lerner is so terrified about her actions coming to public light, that says it all. If she could reduce her perceived role in all this, she would shout her testimony from the highest mountain. Instead, she has wrapped herself in every layer of secrecy she can find. Either she’s protecting a certain someone higher on the food chain or she’s covering her own behind. Knowing the Obama administration, we’re guessing it’s a little of both. Written by Shawn and published by Western Free Press ~ April 14, 2017.

April 15, 2017
Freedom of information, speech and the press is firmly rooted in western democratic thought, and protected by the U.S. Constitution. But in California, apparently that western democratic thought isn?t so free anymore.
An East Sacramento brewery owner who faced a very public protest of his restaurant after he posted a critique of the women?s march on Facebook, has been forced to close his business.
?I am disgusted at all of the people and politicians that supported this anti-Trump event,? Murphy posted on his personal Facebook page in January?not on the Facebook page for Twelve Rounds Brewing Company.
?But Murphy?s post about the march was not his only political message,? the Sacramento Bee deviously reported. ?He has made comments suggesting Barack Obama is a traitor and a Muslim; he referred to abortion as murder; and he made clear his disdain for Hillary Clinton throughout the recent presidential campaign.?
Apparently in leftist Sacramento, it is only okay to ?Celebrate diversity? as long as it solely coincides with the beliefs of the left. Diversity of thought, even offensive thought, is not allowed.
?Daniel Murphy should lose business for his narrowminded [sic] ignorance,? someone responded on Twitter to the Tweet posted by Nick Miller of the Sacramento News and Review (image), which said, ?Hey ladies, the owner of 12 Rounds brewery in Sacramento has some special feedback on the Women?s March ...?
Such interesting hypocrisy here. Randall Selland, the proprietor of Sacramento restaurants Ella, The Kitchen and Sellands, has long been known to share offensive leftist political musings to his patrons. But this Brewer dared to post critique of the ridiculous, highly publicized women?s march on Facebook, and leftists shouted him down. And now they?ve closed him down.
I wonder how Nick Miller would feel about this
I?ve been on the receiving end of Randall Selland?s rants, as have several of my friends. On one occasion, my husband and I were entertaining business clients for dinner at The Kitchen restaurant, which at the time had a 4-month wait for reservations. Selland came by our table and assuming everyone was liberal, as liberals do, started sharing rather distasteful, offensive thoughts about then-President Bush. It was not only tasteless for him to introduce himself with political comments with strangers and paying patrons, his comments were vile, and things I wouldn?t even scream at the radio in the privacy of my own car.
However, after my husband told Selland to bugger off, we vowed to never grace the doorsteps of his restaurants again. That?s it. We didn?t march on his restaurant. We didn?t protest or smash windows. We didn?t even leave a nasty Yelp review. We just decided that his style wasn?t for us.
Flash forward to Daniel Murphy. ?It is with a heavy heart that I am announcing that I am leaving Twelve Rounds Brewing Co,? Murphy posted on the Twelve Rounds Facebook page this week. ?This was my dream and my life. I put all of my heart, soul and money into it. I truly love what I do. It took 3 long years to get open due to delays in construction. We endured it and even paid for an empty building. But, there was a lot of backlash from my political views that have greatly affected Twelve Rounds. Even though they were on my personal Facebook page, It has affected Twelve Rounds too much.?
?Later, after many objected to his views in their own posts, Murphy and his wife hastily posted again, asking for forgiveness from beer drinkers. But the damage was evidently done, and, on Tuesday, Murphy said the backlash had greatly affected the bottom line for Twelve Rounds,? the Bee reported.
One commenter on the Sac Bee article said this: ?If you read the article, he made offensive comments (offensive to most people) on a helluva lot more than just the women?s march. People have free speech, as he did, but one has to expect consequences to it, especially if one has a job or a business.?
Yes, speech has consequences. You cannot yell ?fire? in a crowded theater, or mention ?bomb? on an airplane without suffering consequences. But why does anyone care what his political views are? Does he make great brew? Why protest his business? Just don?t patronize it if you don?t like the guy or his politics.
Why are leftists compelled to shut down everything that makes them uncomfortable, or they disagree with?
Many in America feel similarly to Murphy on a host of the issues he mentioned. But apparently in Sacramento, CA this is not allowed if you own and operate a business.
?But his post, along with several other incendiary political posts, have inspired many to call for a boycott,? the Bee reported, appearing to help gin up the protestors.
The Bee even reported that Twelve Rounds had grow quickly in popularity, won awards for its beers, and recently invested in an expensive bottling line to expand their sales reach at the retail level. ?This sudden uproar has them worried?and based on comments on Twitter and Facebook, they?re losing customers by the minute.?
The Bee went on and on: ?In one post from August, Murphy used a derogatory term for someone from Pakistan, saying the person had?just called on my cell phone and tried to tell me he was from Dell and needed my credit card number to fix malware on my PC. What a moron.?? In one post, he displayed a statement calling the Islamic faith?barbaric.??
Gasp. I also think the Islamic faith is barbaric, given the beheadings, murders of homosexuals, female genital mutilation, wife beatings, child brides, predatory male sexuality with little boys?all behaviors that are illegal in America. In Islam, rape victims are punished, women are worth half of a Muslim man, and infidels are worth nothing. Why don?t Sacramento?s leftists protest this?
Instead, a guy who followed a dream to open a brewery shared his views of the world on his Facebook page with ?friends,? and ends up being forced out of business.
This is communism my friends. Freedom of information, speech and the press is firmly rooted in western democratic thought, as I stated in the first paragraph of this column. In a communist society, an individual?s interests are indistinguishable from society?s. Individual freedom is incompatible with communism. Hysterical mob censorship, which is what this is, and what we are seeing on college campuses, is dangerous, and must be fought by every liberty-loving American.
Right now, there are four states proposing legislation to ensure free speech on college campuses, and to prohibit universities from banning speakers and shielding people from offensive and controversial ideas. (hint: California is not one of the states)
It?s come to this in the United States, that we need to pass laws to protect Constitutional rights we already have. The left, terrified of free speech, shuts it down everywhere it can?even if it means putting a man out of business. The left is dangerously poised on the precipice of delving into communism.

I am thrilled to report that not only are The Darling Buds back but they are back in support of a thoroughly excellent release. The new EP, Evergreen , out on Friday via Odd Box Records , is so good, so effortlessly tuneful that a listener wants to immediately go and fall in love with this group's back-catalog all over again. 
The group this time out -- original singer Andrea Lewis-Jarvis, bassist Chris McDonagh, guitarists Paul 'Chaz' Watkins and Matt Gray, and drummer Erik Stams -- gel remarkably well, so well, in fact, that one might forget that the 2 guitarists are from different eras of the band's past (Watkins from the Crawdaddy line-up and Gray from the Erotica one). Opener ""Evergreen"" positively soars, Andrea's vocals sounding more or less as they have for 30 years now, the anchor in the group's rockier take on the sort of Sixties styles that inspired so many in the C86-C87 generations. ""Guess The Good Parts"" roars past on the back of a killer hook and an assured performance from Lewis-Jarvis, with the results being the sort of tune that begs to be cranked up as one cruises the highway in a car with the windows down. ""Complicated"" achieves the same kind of thing, the overall effect here being a good deal similar to those magnificent early Catatonia singles, that Welsh band surely owing a huge debt to this Welsh band. Evergreen ends with the more down-tempo ""Twenty-One Aches"" , a number that wouldn't have sounded out-of-place on Erotica , though the mood here is one achieved with more guitars than keyboards this time around. 
It seems hard to believe that this is the first new Darling Buds music to be released in 25 years. It really doesn't seem that long ago that I was putting ""Sure Thing"" on mix-tapes in my final year of college. And it doesn't seem like 26 years ago that I saw the band do a wonderful cover of ""Temptation"" by New Order when they played D.C. on the Crawdaddy tour, nor does it seem like it's been 28 years since I worked in a college record store and played ""Let's Go Round There"" off Pop Said... at a dangerously loud volume in the shop. So, believe this fan when I say that Evergreen is not only a set of 4 great Darling Buds songs, it's one of the very rare cases where a comeback release deserves to sit right next to a group's earlier records. There's nothing here in the grooves of Evergreen to suggest that the band have been away or anything like that. The Darling Buds sound, if possible, even a bit more invigorated here than they did on some of their major label albums. And for that reason, I can only hope that Evergreen is just the first in a string of new Darling Buds releases as, surely, a full-length record is the next logical step for these genuine Welsh legends.

___
4:40 p.m.
Japan and the U.S. have outlined a path forward for economic talks between the countries.
The announcement followed an inaugural meeting Tuesday of the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue in Tokyo chaired by visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso.
It said the dialogue would focus on three areas: trade and investment rules and issues, cooperation in macroeconomic policy and specific industry sectors.
The dialogue was set up by President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the Japanese leader's visit to the U.S. in February.

3:40 p.m.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso are kicking off a new U.S.-Japan economic dialogue that was launched during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's meeting with President Donald Trump in the U.S. in February.
As talks began Tuesday, Aso said the U.S.-Japan alliance has underpinned peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and that trade friction with the U.S. has given way to an ""age of cooperation.""
Pence said Trump sees the talks as a way to improve business ties with Japan and is hoping for quick results. The discussions are to focus on economic and structural policy and trade and investment strategies aimed at strengthening both countries' economies.

2:15 p.m.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese leaders have begun talks expected to focus largely on trade with America's anchor ally in the region, though tensions with North Korea loomed large.
Pence reassured Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday that the U.S. considers its alliance with Japan to be a cornerstone of security in the region.
Pence said, ""We appreciate the challenging times in which the people of Japan live with increasing provocations from across the Sea of Japan.""
He also said, ""We are with you 100 percent,"" adding that the U.S. always seeks peace.
Abe said Japan hoped for peaceful dialogue with Pyongyang, ""but at the same time, dialogue for the sake of dialogue is valueless and it is necessary for us to exercise pressure North Korea so that it comes forward and engages in this serious dialogue.""
Pence was having lunch with Abe at the prime minister's official residence after arriving in Japan earlier in the day for the second stop of a 10-day Asia tour.

12:15 p.m.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has arrived in Japan for the second stop of a 10-day Asia tour.

325 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Utah Jazz may have to down the Los Angeles Clippers three more times without prized center Rudy Gobert, whose status for their first-round playoff series is in doubt after his left knee injury that occurred just 12 seconds into their 97-95 win at Staples Center in Los Angeles on Saturday night.
According to the Jazz, who are in the playoffs for the first time since 2012, an MRI revealed that Gobert suffered a hyperextended left knee and a bone contusion when he banged knees with the Clippers’ Luc Mbah a Moute while setting a screen for small forward Gordon Hayward. There is no structural damage, and a team release indicated that there was no specific timeline for his return.

— Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) April 16, 2017 “This is terrible for the Utah Jazz,” ESPN commentator and former NBA head coach Doug Collins said on the telecast.
It was bad news for one of the surprise teams in the Western Conference this season, to be sure, but it could have been much worse. Not only did Gobert avoid tearing his MCL or ACL and facing a months-long recovery, veteran reserve Joe Johnson ended Utah's night on an upswing with his game-winning shot that gave them the 1-0 series lead. The two teams play again on Tuesday.
The Jazz had a banner season, finishing 51-31 overall to secure the No. 5 seed while Gobert anchored their defense that had the league's third-best defensive rating while averaging 14 points (on 66.1% shooting), 12.8 rebounds (fourth in the NBA) and 2.6 blocks per game (first). He was the first player in NBA history to average at least 14 points, 12 rebounds, and two blocks per game while shooting at least 63% overall.

Hugo Castro’s missing poster reads, “Wanted. Seen for the last time on a live steam April 13 at 4:28 pm.” Border Angels 
His partner told 
KPBS radio in San Diego she is scheduled to meet Tuesday morning in Mexico City with federal prosecutors to review security camera video that they hope will give clues as to his whereabouts. 
In his own 20-minute video, posted on Facebook Thursday afternoon, Castro says in Spanish, “I was threatened. They want to kill me,” adding a short time later: “I need help. I need help.” 
Castro’s partner, Gaba Cortes, told KPBS that she missed a phone call Friday afternoon but called the number back and reached a taxi driver, who told her that he had driven Castro to Mexico City. The American reportedly said he still planned to head to the rendezvous point for the immigrant caravan, in the town of Querétaro, which is about 130 miles northwest of the capital. 
In the Facebook video, Castro appears alongside a freeway and says he is the road that connects Mexico City with the city of Puebla, to the southeast. The American reports that his cell phone battery is running low and that he does not have a lot of money. 
He mentions others who have disappeared in Mexico and says, “Please, someone come. . . . I don’t know what else to say.” 
Castro has been working odd jobs to pay the bills but devoting most of his time over the past decade to aid immigrants in Mexico, according to Morones. Both men work for Border Angels which, according to its website, is an “all-volunteer, non-profit organization that advocates for human rights, humane immigration reform, and social justice.” 
Castro had been 
featured a week ago by KPBS for his work aiding Haitians stranded in Tijuana and Mexicali after the U.S. toughened entry rules on the Caribbean refugees. The story depicted Castro bringing food to shelters and confronting an aid worker who appeared to no longer be welcoming the foreigners. 
Castro said that he did not believe in the leaders of Mexico or the U.S., adding: “But I do believe in the people. So we, the people, el pueblo , are the ones who are bringing the change.” 
Morones said it was not uncommon for volunteers working along the border to be threatened by smugglers and others who making money by preying on migrants. “About three weeks ago, Hugo was threatened,” Morones said. “He was trying to help these Haitians and people who were trying to take advantage of them said ‘It’s none of your business. Stay out of it.’” Morones said he told the volunteer to file a police report about the intimidation. 
In joining the caravan escorting Central Americans from Querétaro, Castro intended to raise awareness about the plight of the migrants, many of whom cannot get asylum in the U.S. Smugglers and others have robbed, raped and beaten the immigrants. 
Castro’s sister, Angie Velazquez, said via email that her brother had helped hundreds of people, but he declined to “brag about it” or seek attention. 
“He has the kindest heart,” she said. “He helps, whether he knows you or not; he helps with no strings attached.” Share: ",American Who Aids Immigrants Reported Missing in Mexico,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kzgy91Dka_uv96W5OP56zahM0yLiret_ZVQd66.p0Hinxr46skf6jqPpyXrBsOXegQnRbtylDgq12uOWfKoQG96OrR2qJr07AwQYwcJGgIBTnceUV5Aqa,fdcb74d9930fb29fd8e580672e45d8606445c36b,www.41nbc.com,http://www.41nbc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/National.jpg,,,US,,0,41nbc.com,0,American Who Aids Immigrants Reported Missing in Mexico,0.274,news,0,"[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'hugo castro'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'gaba cortes'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'angie velazquez'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'morones'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'castro'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'mexico'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'tijuana'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'san diego'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'u.s.'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'puebla'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'querétaro'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'caribbean'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'mexico city'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'mexicali'}]","[{'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'kpbs'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'kpbs radio'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'border angels'}, {'sentiment': 'none', 'name': 'facebook'}]"

Pence first joined a working lunch with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe before meeting Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso for economic talks. U.S. President Donald Trump and Abe arranged the talks between their deputies at a Washington summit in February, soon after Trump took office. ""When President Trump agreed to this dialogue, he envisioned this as a mechanism for enhancing bilateral commercial relations between the United States and Japan, and achieving results in the near future. And I share that vision and impatience,"" Pence told Aso at the start of the talks, comments that could be construed as a warning to Tokyo not to use the dialogue to kick touchy topics down the road. Aso in turn said U.S.-Japan trade friction, which soured ties in the 1980s and 1990s, was a thing of the distant past and the allies were now entering an era of cooperation. In a statement after the talks, the two sides said they had agreed the dialogue should produce ""concrete results in the near term"" adding that they had ""discussed specific sectors where improved commercial relations will promote mutual economic benefits and job creation in both countries"". Earlier, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met Japan's trade minister, Hiroshige Seko. Ross, seen as more hardline on trade, told reporters Washington was eager to increase trade ties with Tokyo through a two-way agreement. Pence landed in Tokyo from South Korea after a trip that included a visit to the heavily fortified border separating the North and South. He described the U.S.-Japan alliance as the ""cornerstone"" of regional security. Pence's 10-day tour of Asia is aimed at emphasising that U.S. President Donald Trump wants to boost U.S. trade in the region even though Trump has abandoned the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact. Advocates for the TPP, negotiated by former President Barack Obama and supported by Abe, said it would have opened markets for American exports. U.S. business groups supported the deal but U.S. labour unions argued it would hurt American workers. Trump campaigned for office on an ""America First"" platform, saying he would boost U.S. manufacturing jobs and shrink the country's trade deficit with countries like Japan. Trump also vowed to renegotiate existing regional trade deals to focus on bilateral agreements. Tokyo is wary of a two-way free trade agreement (FTA), fearing it would boost pressure to open up politically sensitive sectors such as agriculture. ""It’s a little bit early to say just what forms things will take but we are certainly eager to increase our trade relationships with Japan and to do so in the form of an agreement,"" Ross said when asked about a possible FTA. TRADE IMBALANCES Japan had a $69 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, the U.S. Treasury Department said, expressing concern over what it called the ""persistence"" of the imbalance. Japanese officials counter that Tokyo accounts for a much smaller chunk of America's deficit than in the past, while China's imbalance is much bigger. Trump has complained that Japan keeps its currency artificially low, although a Treasury Department report last week did not label Japan a currency manipulator. The issue was not expected to be raised in talks on Tuesday. Pence said in Seoul earlier on Tuesday the Trump administration would review and reform a 5-year-old free trade agreement with South Korea. The Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association expressed concern about any review of the pact, which removed tariffs on auto trade between the two countries. Trump and Abe agreed in February to have Pence and Aso, who is also Japan's finance minister, open an economic dialogue. The two sides were expected to agree on principles and a process for further detailed discussions between ministries. ""Obviously, the first high-level talk is not going to have an immediate resolution of anything but I think we have a reasonable path forward,"" Ross said. Aso told reporters before the talks he would not discuss any bilateral free trade deal with Pence. The White House adviser said Tuesday's talks would not prescribe a free-trade deal but talks might eventually lead to such negotiations. Pence developed ties with Japanese business and political leaders as governor of Indiana, a state that is home to Subaru <7270.T>, Honda <7267.T> and Toyota <7203.T> plants, and about 260 Japanese companies employing about 60,000 residents. ""To some extent, we want to do for the United States what we did for Indiana,"" the White House adviser said. The Trump administration wants to attract more foreign direct investment, hoping to lure some with a $1 trillion plan to rebuild U.S. roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Pence will take that message to upcoming stops this week in Jakarta and Sydney. While no immediate announcements are expected from Tokyo, the White House expects a ""handful"" of investment announcements while Pence is in Australia at the weekend, the adviser said. He is due to meet corporate leaders at each of his stops.

Since this is your first visit to the park I suggest you be sure your itinerary gives priority to exploring the Valley area itself.
The hiking ideas you laid out represent a very aggressive plan for all but the most trail-hardened, experienced hikers who know they can handle high altitude. You're talking about:
- A Half Dome day of 14 miles and nearly 5,000 ft elevation gain and another 5,000 descent
- A 4-Mile/Panorama day of 13.5 miles and 4,000 ft elevation gain and another 4,000 descent
- A Cloud's Rest day of 14 miles and about 2,500 ft elevation gain and another 2,500 descent (in/out Sunrise)
- What would be considered robust day hikes for many with Yosemite Falls , North Dome and Cathedral.
You're a kid in a candy store, you want EVERYTHING, and that's OK, I think people on this forum can appreciate that. Tell us more about your hiking experience -- your ideas aren't impossible but they would be feasible only for the fittest and most experienced hikers. And have you ever hiked at high altitude?
How many days are you planning for doing all this? Are you expecting to do all of these hikes on consecutive days, or with relaxed days in between?
Do you have the equipment to backpack? If so you would see a lot more and could have a more relaxed pace as well since you won't necessarily be doubling back to civilization every night like with all dayhikes. Your plans have you crossing in and around LYV a few times, with backpacking you could be much more efficient with your mileage, for example hike to LYV and use that as a basecamp to do HD one day, CR another, and then finish by going up the Panorama and down the 4-Mile (or start with the 4-Mile and end with the Mist). Just a thought.

3. Hope he's got some time to acclimatise to the elevation
I think Yosemite Falls would we well and truly dry by October, so I'm not sure I'd include that unless you're after the view of Yosemite Valley from above.
Is your Half Dome hike your first day in Yosemite (not including your arrival day)? Will you have a car?
I was going to suggest you consider Cathedral Lakes as a recovery session after Half Dome. However, this would require you to drive from the valley to the high country and back to the Valley. Or you could drive to Glacier Point and hike as much of the Panorama trail as you like and then return to Glacier Point. Then you wouldn't have to worry about returning to your car or repeating The Mist Trail portion that you already covered on your Half Dome hike.
If you have one night in Lee Vining , were you thinking of hiking Clouds Rest before or after that night?
I'm trying to see how you would fit these hikes in:
Day 1: Arrive from FAT (assume in own vehicle)
? what time ? time for a hike ? Glacier Point Sentinel Dome ?
>> overnight in Yosemite Valley
Day 2: Half Dome
>> overnight in Yosemite Valley
Day 3: Drive to the High Country early and complete Clouds Rest or another hike?
Or hike Four Mile-Panorama combo then drive to Lee Vining?
>> overnight in Lee Vining
Day 4: Hike Clouds Rest or hike another (or multiple) shorter High Country hikes
(Cathedral Lakes, Gaylor Lakes, Elizabeth Lake , Lembert Dome and Dog Lake individually or in combination)
Drive to Yosemite Bug
>> overnight at Yosemite Bug
Day 5: (departure) via Mariposa Grove (if open) and drive back to FAT
Hopefully PacificNorthwestFamily will be along soon to give you the benefit of her wisdom on all things Yosemite hiking.

I am also planning to hike the 4 mile-Glacier Point- Panorama- Mist Trail loop as well, though I understand there is overlap b/w this 2 trails (Mist Trail). One other trail I'm interested is Clouds Rest off Tioga Rd. Are these good mix of trails for Yosemite?
I have one more full day, looking for your input:
one more trail in Yosemite Valley such as Upper Yosemite Falls? or in Tioga Road area such as North Dome , Cathedral lakes? Or any other suggestion?
My last day will be a 1/2 day which I am hoping to visit Mariposa Grove if it's open by that time.
Lodging wise, I have 2 nights in the Valley, 1 in Lee Vining (easy access to Tioga?), 1 in Yosemite Bug (to save money), and will be using FAT.
TIA

Be sure you read the relevant topics in the Top Questions & Trip Ideas on the right.
Consider daylight hours: www.SunriseSunset.com
I'll wait for your answers to some of the excellent questions that have been posed.
You know that the amenities along Tioga Road ( Tuolumne Meadows store, for example) will be closed for the season, right?
Current tentative reopening of Mariposa Grove is planned for September. We'll see.
